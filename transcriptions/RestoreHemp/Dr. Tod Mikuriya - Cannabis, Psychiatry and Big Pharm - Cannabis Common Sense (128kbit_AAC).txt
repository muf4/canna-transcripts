[SPEAKER_00]: We roughly estimate that about a third of
the people are receiving letters of
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation and approval for primarily
emotional or mental problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cannabis is a unique psychotropic
in this context in that it has effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: both cognition and affect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also are inextricably connected with
different kinds of physical functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, with anorexia, people get
inadequate nutrition because of their
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety causing a suppression of the
appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that when they receive cannabis,
the nutrition is improved because the
[SPEAKER_00]: peristalsis and the spasm, the spasm is
relieved, peristalsis is promoted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also evacuation, which then produces
improved mood and improved functioning
[SPEAKER_00]: with regard to cognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also includes people with thought
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might find this kind of unusual,
but there are certain aspects of cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning that cannabis helps,
like suppressing or decreasing obsessive
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking and also paranoid ideation and
paranoid delusional thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, the short term memory loss
that people experience when they acutely
[SPEAKER_00]: medicate with usually inhaled cannabis is
they can't hold a paranoid delusion long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same goes for obsessive compulsive
disorder because they can't keep up this
[SPEAKER_00]: string of pathologic associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the modulation of affect also
affects the cognitive behavior with
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased anxiety this decreases the
pressure for this abnormal type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that a new category is warranted
that cannabis fits, and that's easement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see several meanings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main meanings is giving
ease, not the property legalistic kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: passage or going on to some property and
getting certain rights, but easement as a
[SPEAKER_00]: calming effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I believe cannabis more
closely approximates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same as a benzodiazepine,
which produces sedation, and ironically,
[SPEAKER_00]: depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no free lunch pharmacologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people do not like the benzodiazepines
and other sedatives for these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis helps restore emotional
responsivity in a normal way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also goes along with people with
their paranoid ideation and disturbance of
[SPEAKER_00]: interpersonal relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: With certain people with thought disorder,
they note that they're more able to relate
[SPEAKER_00]: to others, which then improves their
self-esteem and their social functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to find this written
anywhere because of the psychiatric
[SPEAKER_00]: literature being horribly biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've looked through the APA
publications going back maybe 70 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it all is painted with the antisocial
element and calling it dysfunctionality or
[SPEAKER_00]: character defect or other kinds of
pejorative, condemnatory terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all pill pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to that end, we really don't know what
is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this extends not just to
psychotropics, but I'm going to read you a
[SPEAKER_00]: short letter to John A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kitzhaber, MD, Director, Center for
Evidence-Based Policy, Oregon Health and
[SPEAKER_00]: Science University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is who I suggest, if you want to
contact to embarrass a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On February 25th, I have the view of panel
presentation by your organization on
[SPEAKER_00]: C-SPAN on the cost-benefit study of
different forms of pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_00]: contracted by AARP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sum total of that panel was they could
not develop any cost-benefits analyses
[SPEAKER_00]: because in analyzing the pharmaceutical
literature, they discovered it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: promotional rather than objective and
scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything masquerading as science is
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based upon California clinical
experience with a range of chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, our findings indicated
significant advantage over other
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals conventionally utilized
because of improved quality of life and
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consequently, we request the opportunity
to discuss our findings with you attached
[SPEAKER_00]: as a list of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what the response was?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad this is going over cable TV in
the Portland area, and hopefully somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: out there in the viewing audience can give
the center a call and ask them to include
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in their studies, and especially
about the mental health issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be fascinated to hear the
response, but I won't hold my breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So may I interject just very briefly?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's research I'm sure you guys are all
aware of about the synergistic effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: the receptor effects of opiates and
cannabinoids where they basically are
[SPEAKER_01]: hitchhiking with each other, and much
smaller doses of both medications create
[SPEAKER_01]: the same benefit with, of course,
much less side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are really remarkable findings,
and I really regret that there aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians who are just monitoring the
reduction in the prescription patterns of
[SPEAKER_01]: their patients if they doubt that cannabis
is useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that's new?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read marijuana medical papers,
in the Ohio State Medical Society meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis in 1860, a Dr. Frombiller from
Ohio reported that using an alternative,
[SPEAKER_00]: alternating courses of opiates and
cannabis for treating chronic conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced dependence on opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1859, this was written.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, this is something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're talking about the takeover by
Big Farm and ruining policy through their
[SPEAKER_00]: special interest money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, the fact that this whole
system, this, can I use my favorite
phrase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Monomolecular mercantile madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all patent office driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look back to what it was before the
single molecule ascended to its role in
[SPEAKER_00]: current commercial medicine, you'll see
that it's all secondary to what can get
[SPEAKER_00]: patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they claim that the newly
patented material is increasingly better,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah, but then you see what's
happened to the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten thoroughly corrupted and
perverted so that you don't know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have now a drug seeking,
drug hungering public convinced that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need all sorts of combinations of
patentable materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really sickening our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they started directly advertising
to the public for psychotropics,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, ask your doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social anxiety disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these kinds of influences to influence
you and their bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
