[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Scott Hoagland.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Planet Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting in a Motel 6, and the Bible
was there on the shelf, so I decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it up and read a verse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, according to Genesis chapter 1,
verse 29, God gave every man every herb
[SPEAKER_00]: bearing a seed which is on the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a plant I had which bears a
seed, ended me up in a jail, and they took
[SPEAKER_00]: my herb away and threw me in a cage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that makes me ask the question,
who are the...
[SPEAKER_03]: Research hemp goes back a long ways for
being used by man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Maloney is the head of the wood
materials and engineering department at
[SPEAKER_05]: the Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is in his laboratories that he and his
associates test building products
[SPEAKER_05]: manufactured from hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, I'd like you to meet Ken Friedman,
president of American Hemp Mercantile in
[SPEAKER_05]: Seattle, Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ken imports and sells goods made from
hemp, including paper, fabric,
[SPEAKER_05]: food, even furniture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is Paul Stanford, president of
Tree Free Eco Paper in Portland,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul sells the many paper products that
can be made from hemp, from envelopes to
[SPEAKER_05]: letterhead to corrugated boxes to computer
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, our paper is made from nonwood
fiber, primarily hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, let's clear the air of a few
misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp and marijuana are often referred to
as the same substance, but this is untrue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp is a plant that grows mostly over
most of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Latin name is cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the same plant that the marijuana
comes from, but it's grown differently and
[SPEAKER_04]: they hybrid it, so it's very low in THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were to think of an apple tree,
hemp would be the tree itself,
[SPEAKER_05]: the bark, the roots, the stems,
the leaves, the whole tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marijuana would then be the fruit of the
tree or the apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp is a crop that grows annually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows relatively rapidly, depending on
location.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Pacific Northwest, from what I
understand, is a good location for growing
[SPEAKER_03]: the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a lot of material grown
annually.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow it on land that might not be
good for forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps the biggest hurdle tripping the
hemp industry is the mistaken idea that
[SPEAKER_05]: when hemp is grown, marijuana is always
produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people get confused about what is
hemp and what's marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in other parts of your
program, you're discussing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're quite different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always tell people, I say, well,
what is hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, well, just think about hemp rope.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the hemp that you're really
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marijuana is only grown on female plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: If male plants are grown, only industry
usable material is produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides growing only male plants,
science has created a genetic hybrid that
[SPEAKER_05]: produces no marijuana whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, non-industrial hemp would be illegal
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: The things that's being grown in people's
basements are imported from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Industrial hemp is a different hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grown differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grown for the stalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the fibers come from the stalks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow close together.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't grow it for the leaves or the
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the plant that produces the best and
most fiber doesn't produce the
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive substance in any quantities
that are useful for drug production.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been doing it for generations in
Western Europe and for centuries in
[SPEAKER_04]: Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, in the United States,
we had industrial hemp until 1937.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scientists have dated hemp use back 12,000
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is known to be one of the first four
cultivated crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: 12,000 years ago, hemp was one of the
first crops that was purposely cultivated
[SPEAKER_02]: by human beings in the first agricultural
settlements that sprung up in the Tigris
[SPEAKER_02]: Euphrates valleys and in the Yellow River
Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sailing ships used hemp to make the sail
cloth, and hemp's been used in making
[SPEAKER_03]: paper for centuries and centuries.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one plant was used to make the paper
that by people's and even the Declaration
[SPEAKER_05]: of Independence were printed on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp has been woven into garments
throughout history and across the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only was the very first American flag
sewn by Betsy Ross made from hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: but so were the clothes and supplies of
the many soldiers that fought to keep her
[SPEAKER_05]: waving.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was illegal not to grow hemp in some of
the British colonies because they needed
[SPEAKER_04]: it for their sails and their ropes,
and they needed enough of a production to
[SPEAKER_04]: satisfy the Navy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But more recently, in the 1940s when the
United States was at war in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_05]: and many of our supplies were cut off,
the United States government produced a
[SPEAKER_05]: video called Hemp for Victory.
[SPEAKER_05]: This video was to encourage farmers to
grow hemp for the war effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: American hemp must meet the needs of our
Army and Navy as well as of our
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1942, patriotic farmers at the
government's request planted 36,000 acres
[SPEAKER_01]: of seed hemp, an increase of several
thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal for 1943 is 50,000 acres of seed
hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, when grown for paper production,
it would take four acres of trees to make
[SPEAKER_05]: the same amount of usable pulp material as
one acre of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hemp is the longest and strongest
plant fiber, so it can make a stronger
[SPEAKER_02]: paper than wood fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wood fiber's maximum length is about seven
to eight millimeters, where hemp fiber can
[SPEAKER_02]: be up to three meters long or hundreds of
times longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That same one acre of hemp can be
harvested three times a year, for hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: only has a 120 day growing season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tree-free paper can be made with any
combination of hemp pulp from 10% to 90%
[SPEAKER_04]: to 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: The paperwork currently produced is 90%
hemp, 10% cotton.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got the obvious advantages over
wood pulp because you don't need to cut
[SPEAKER_04]: trees to make nice paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also stronger than wood pulp.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be recycled more times.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to USDA Bulletin 404,
a waste product for making canvas,
[SPEAKER_02]: rope, lace, and linen that waste product
makes more than four times more paper than
[SPEAKER_02]: trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to a Dutch study that was
published in last July of 93's Pulp and
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper magazine, the total production from
hemp, both the bast fiber, which can be
[SPEAKER_02]: made into both paper and textiles,
plus the herd fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those fibers together produce more than
eight times more paper than the most
[SPEAKER_02]: productive tree species.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another advantage to hemp paper over tree
paper is that no harmful acids are used in
[SPEAKER_05]: the bleaching process.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be bleached with hydrogen peroxide
to avoid the chlorine problems from paper
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is an ideal product for paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It yields a lot of pulp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can make paper with the
by-products of the textile industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can use all of the plant and make
each of them cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the plant, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp is composed of very long fibers,
up to 15 feet in length.
[SPEAKER_05]: And depending on how the hemp is grown,
these fibers can be woven into fabric.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabric as soft as women's lingerie or as
rough as burlap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, as you know, hemp fiber can be used
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is being used in cloth products.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Chinese are doing a better job right
now in the lighter weight fabric.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are spinning finer threads that the
Hungarians are able to do and will start
[SPEAKER_04]: doing in bigger quantities immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are probably hundreds of products
you could do from hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones we're currently doing are fabrics
and almost everything you make from
[SPEAKER_04]: fabric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clothing, bags, wallets, hats,
things like that are all being made
[SPEAKER_04]: currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Futons, it's a good upholstery fabric.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabric made from hemp is three times
stronger than cotton, is more water
[SPEAKER_05]: absorbent than cotton, and is warmer than
cotton.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good alternative to cotton because
it's grown without pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stops soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's drought resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cotton has a lot of impact on the
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grown with a lot of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some soil degradation problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's erosion problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the problems of harvesting it and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp is very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's naturally resistant to pests and it's
naturally resistant to droughts and so you
[SPEAKER_04]: can grow it without putting new chemicals
into the environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Visualize, if you can, a house made
entirely of hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start with the foundation, the concrete.
[SPEAKER_05]: In France, they have perfected a technique
where you mix hemp herd with lime.
[SPEAKER_05]: That substance then mineralizes into a
material that is stronger, lighter,
[SPEAKER_05]: and more durable than concrete.
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of our foundation lie the building
materials made from trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp has the potential to replace these
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long fiber is very intriguing to many
people because you can take that and make
[SPEAKER_03]: it into long structural pieces using that
fiber because you've got the fiber length
[SPEAKER_02]: and the hemp fiber is very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now, the demand exceeds the
supply and because of that, that's driven
[SPEAKER_02]: the price up.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the long term, though, when there
aren't the artificial barriers to the
[SPEAKER_02]: market that exist today, hemp fiber will
be less expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Within the walls of our house,
we need plumbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp can be made into a biodegradable
substitute for plastic plumbing pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a sample of a hemp board.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some others here, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm holding up one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks something like what I just
showed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not quite the same because some of this
has to be worked out yet exactly how to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with these materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the machinery isn't quite right,
but that's because we're using wood
[SPEAKER_03]: machinery and not hemp machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: This board is not as good as this one over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, again, you probably can't see it
on the camera, but it has a nicer surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks better and I know because the
numbers aren't on the back here,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I do know it's much stronger in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's much stronger than the
traditional MDF or medium density fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a house fire, people are often killed
by the gases from their carpet as it
[SPEAKER_05]: burns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp carpet releases no poisonous fumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be around doors, windows,
what have you, where we use high quality
[SPEAKER_03]: lumber in the past, which we really don't
have much of anymore, no matter what
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody says.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as this is painted, you would
never know the difference between this
[SPEAKER_03]: being a nice mill piece of Douglas fir,
oak, what have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to have a wood grain,
you can print it on, overlay it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this is done already.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's moving into a lot of the traditional
use boxes where we used to have lumber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oil from the hemp seed can even be used to
make paints and varnishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has worked elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been used some in this country in the
past, but there is a possibility of making
[SPEAKER_03]: this kind of product with the fiber as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all kinds of mixtures too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use a good long hemp fiber on
the surfaces and some poor fiber or
[SPEAKER_03]: particle in the middle because it's for
bending purposes, and the fiber gives you
[SPEAKER_03]: the bending property.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's all kinds of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to boil down to economics like
all of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does it cost to do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does it cost to grow the
material, harvest it, process it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and supply and demand's in there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have the wood material and
you want to keep making these kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: products, you use something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us want it to happen as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be good for the American farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be good for the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be good for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get cheaper hemp products here very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same process by which we make ethanol
fuel from corn can be used to convert hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: into a usable gas for our cars and to heat
our houses.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a process which you can make the
same way you make ethanol from corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make it out of hemp very
economically, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also make hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be used as a fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: This would mean less dependency on any
foreign oils and would reduce the price of
[SPEAKER_05]: gasoline in this country.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what about food?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp seeds contain all the necessary and
essential fatty acids, amino acids,
[SPEAKER_05]: and protein necessary for human life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use it as a cooking additive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use the hemp seeds themselves in
cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can cook in the oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And such a variety of foods can be made
with the hemp seed, anything from hemp ice
[SPEAKER_05]: cream to hemp peanut butter, all of which
aid in increasing the body's immune system
[SPEAKER_05]: and actually remove life-threatening
plaque from our arteries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very high in the essential fatty
acids, high in protein, low in the bad
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of cholesterol, high in the good kind
of cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like flax seed oil as far as all the
health benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as it has done in the past,
the potential is there for hemp food to
[SPEAKER_05]: play a key role in ending our world's
hunger problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably everything can cure world hunger
if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be part of the solution,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a plant that you can grow and be
good for the environment at the same time
[SPEAKER_04]: feed people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's high in protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would contribute to the solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what climate conditions are good for
growing hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hemp is indigenous to Central Asian
region, area of Kazakhstan, Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Tibetan region of China and Kashmir
region of India.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp is like a weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can grow virtually anywhere in
virtually any soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there are two main sources of hemp
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: market right now, Hungarian hemp and
Chinese hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's grown in Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made legal to grow in England,
I believe, in June of this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some hemp farms in Canada at
the present time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp can be planted in areas that have
been deforested or fallen victim to a
[SPEAKER_05]: fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow it on land that might not be
good for forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand some parts here in eastern
Washington where it's not particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: great for growing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp crop would grow well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Its long roots anchor the soil in place to
prevent erosion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And its nutrient-rich foliage mixes with
the soil to actually increase the
[SPEAKER_05]: fertility for the coming years.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why hemp is also a good rotation
crop for farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Judging from the acceptance our products
have gotten, I'm pretty sure the general
[SPEAKER_04]: public would not have any objection or
very little objection to industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: being grown here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The politicians don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody even wants to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the environmental issues becoming
more crucial, with American farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: needing new crops, with the paper industry
needing new pulp, it should happen very
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea behind the hemp movement is not
to eliminate jobs or eliminate industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is to create more jobs and new
industries to integrate hemp knowledge and
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp products into today's society.
[SPEAKER_03]: The logical way to use this to start with
is as a supplement to present wood
[SPEAKER_03]: material in an operating medium density
fiberboard plant, like I showed here,
[SPEAKER_03]: or particle board, which is a little
coarser particle, as a supplement to that
[SPEAKER_03]: raw material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people become familiar with the
processing of the material and it gets
[SPEAKER_03]: used properly in the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually, with success,
you could move on to a manufacturing plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that would use the hemp material
exclusively.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not optimistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be five or ten years before they
allow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're trying to do is put the hemp
products under the nose of the American
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers so they can see it's a good
product and not be afraid of it and start
[SPEAKER_04]: accepting it and accepting the idea of
growing it here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Support your local hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy hemp products.
[SPEAKER_05]: See for yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Test them against products that you use
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which do you like better?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then make a choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would appear that it has lots of
benefits and a lot of good things that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the secret is economics, like I said
before, and developing a way to take it
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the political and emotional scene
so that there's not a concern that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing a drug material rather than a
building material.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just a question of how much
political resistance there's going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could happen within one year of the
United States government allowing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might happen sooner under a permit
plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's going to happen is that
cannabis will be taxed and regulated and
[SPEAKER_02]: that hemp fiber and seed will be grown
without regulation and in ten years will
[SPEAKER_02]: become a major source of fiber for paper
making.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Scott Hoagland.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Planet Hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.
