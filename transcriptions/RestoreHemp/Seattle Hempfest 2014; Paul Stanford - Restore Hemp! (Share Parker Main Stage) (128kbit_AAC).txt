[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that marijuana is our
Mother Earth's greatest gift to mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces more fuel, more fiber,
and more food than any other plant on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marijuana prohibition has never really
been about drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana prohibition was always about
money, power, and the continued
[SPEAKER_00]: centralization of economic and political
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole marijuana myth was made up to
displace petroleum and tree fiber and
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't have made hemp illegal if
they said it was hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't have made any of that
illegal unless if they said it was
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, they couldn't have made it
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only by making this new word,
marijuana, and using that with racist
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda that they were able to prohibit
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have prohibited the most
productive plant on the planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that is also the oldest cultivated
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All archaeologists agree it's been
cultivated for at least 10,000 and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: over 30,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the very basis of agriculture itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the most productive crop and
the oldest crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a limited legalization
with the initiative here where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You folks have to realize we all are going
to have to remain active, remain vigilant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and contact our political representatives,
side petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to change the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's a better law,
it's not good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until our farmers can cultivate hemp
without regard to its THC content,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with a focus on the most productive
varieties of seed for fiber and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: various uses of hemp, until that happens,
it's going to be prohibitively expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we allow farmers to cultivate hemp
without regard to its THC content,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll begin to displace petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our farmers can get that money instead of
the petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_00]: military, industrial, transnational,
corporate, elite, fascist sons of bitches
[SPEAKER_00]: that run the world today and give us the
worst for oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need the petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything petroleum touches,
it makes toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is a natural alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can give the money to our farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going into the Swiss bank
accounts and the despots around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just urge you guys to get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't settle for the status quo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And help us restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
