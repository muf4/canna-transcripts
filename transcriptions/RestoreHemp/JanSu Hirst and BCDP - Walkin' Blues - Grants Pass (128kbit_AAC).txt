[SPEAKER_00]: We want to remind you we're all here for
the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: time to re-legalize cannabis hemp in this
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a decision from the Oregon
Supreme Court that said all you medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients are second-class
citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be fired just for what medicine
you're taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we need to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will always be treated second-class
citizens until it's legal for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's right, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your job now, you have a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself registered if you're not
registered to vote and when it comes up I
[SPEAKER_03]: want you to sign the petition and once
that petition is signed and we put it
[SPEAKER_03]: forward and it's enough names and we can
get it on the ballot in the fall,
[SPEAKER_03]: vote this sucker in.
