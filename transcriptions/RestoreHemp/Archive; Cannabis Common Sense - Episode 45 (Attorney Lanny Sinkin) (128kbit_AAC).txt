[SPEAKER_00]: Video taped at the studios of City Video
at the Rage Nightclub, it is now time for
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show that tells you the truth about
marijuana and the politics behind its
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here's the host of your show,
Paul Stanford and Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our show is brought to you by the
production of our political committee,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Campaign for the Restoration and
Regulation of Him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and good evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight we're fortunate to have a
special guest, Lanny Sinken, attorney from
[SPEAKER_03]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Lanny.
[SPEAKER_03]: My pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Paul said, that this is a
production of our political committee and
[SPEAKER_03]: we have an initiative out, the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that initiative, which is on the
streets right now, will as a comprehensive
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation system for cannabis that will
allow it to be sold for medical patients
[SPEAKER_03]: in pharmacies to adults over 21 in state
liquor stores and allow our farmers to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow hemp as a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there anything else on that,
Paul?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you covered it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The money, the proceeds from it will go to
the state general fund.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll cut taxes for all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: 90% of it goes to the state general fund,
8% for drug treatment programs and 1% for
[SPEAKER_04]: a drug education program, 1% for a state
committee to promote industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a comprehensive program initiative
to get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you'd like to get a copy of our
initiative, we can have you call our
[SPEAKER_03]: office.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the number is 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight we have Lanny Sinken with us
and he's an attorney involved in some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the marijuana activist case here in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wonder if you could tell us why
you're here tonight, Lanny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here because we are scheduled to
appear before the Ninth Circuit Court of
[SPEAKER_01]: Appeals that's going to be sitting in
Portland, Oregon on two civil rights
[SPEAKER_01]: cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, in both cases, we have the
same set of facts on one issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Paul Stanford was involved very deeply
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The large case is Floyd Landreth,
an activist here in Portland who has been
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested numerous times for his political
activities, has materials seized,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of different actions taken by the
city of Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that case is a classic civil rights
case because the city of Portland,
[SPEAKER_01]: through its police officers, its city
attorney, its city council, has engaged in
[SPEAKER_01]: a systematic campaign to suppress those
who are trying to change the hemp laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying that it includes the city
council and the mayor?
[SPEAKER_01]: The defendants named in this case are 18
police officers, six or seven city
[SPEAKER_01]: attorneys, Mayor Vera Katz, and all the
members of the city council at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: the case was filed five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Blumenauer has moved on and Mr.
Lindberg has retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are defendants in the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that case is really about the
neighborhood associations and the police
[SPEAKER_01]: department engaging in a conspiracy to
stop Floyd Landreth and others from trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to change the hemp laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that conspiracy became
acknowledged by the police, after Mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Landreth was arrested in one point,
the police officer in charge of the arrest
[SPEAKER_01]: was interviewed by the press and said he
had arrested Mr. Landreth because he did
[SPEAKER_01]: not agree with what Mr. Landreth stood
for, that he disagreed with his political
[SPEAKER_01]: effort and that the police and the
neighborhood associations were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop the effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a classic civil rights case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went on from there, the numerous
complaints we filed with the city
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney's office, with the city council
trying to get them to take action and
[SPEAKER_01]: their repeated refusal to do so ended up
making all of them defendants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second case was really about those
activities engaged in by the police
[SPEAKER_01]: department that were designed to prevent
people from signing petitions for the
[SPEAKER_01]: previous marijuana initiative,
that the campaign to pay for schools
[SPEAKER_01]: through regulating hemp, or I forget
exactly the title.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our previous incarnation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The previous incarnation of ACTA.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we had was police officers
campaigning on public time in their
[SPEAKER_01]: official position to try and prevent the
gathering of signatures and that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: violating both state law and the United
States Constitution in that tax money was
[SPEAKER_01]: being used to fund one side of a political
campaign and the police were engaged in an
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that was brought to the attention of
the mayor's office, the mayor said
[SPEAKER_01]: basically she didn't care because she
didn't agree with the initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that count, the mayor was named as a
defendant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brought in five other police officers
into the case and we filed a separate case
[SPEAKER_01]: on behalf of the new marijuana initiative
that's pending now in Oregon, gathering
[SPEAKER_01]: signatures now, trying to get an
injunction to prevent the police from
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging in political activity illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was thrown out by the same judge that
threw out the other case saying that there
[SPEAKER_01]: were no federal claims in either case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are asking the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals to reverse the judge and remove
[SPEAKER_01]: the judge and give us a judge who's not so
biased, who will treat impartially the
[SPEAKER_01]: factual and legal claims that are in the
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is very amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say I am involved in these cases
as an attorney, but still when I stop and
[SPEAKER_03]: think about it, it's amazing that a police
officer can say that we don't like what a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain person stands for and so therefore
we're going to stop them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Landers case isn't really a hemp
case in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a straight-up First Amendment civil
rights case that the city government can
[SPEAKER_01]: think for a moment that they have the
right to suppress unpopular political
[SPEAKER_01]: movements and use public resources to do
it is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that the city attorney's
office was placed on notice repeatedly by
[SPEAKER_01]: letters from Paul Loney and letters from
me that this was happening took no action
[SPEAKER_01]: to do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that the city council took no
action to do anything about it ends up
[SPEAKER_01]: making the city liable for extensive
damages, for extensive attorney's costs,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a situation that we were astonished
would actually have developed this far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have thought that when a police
officer arrests somebody and says up front
[SPEAKER_01]: to the press, I arrested him because I
don't agree with what he stands for and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to stop his political
movement, that the city government would
[SPEAKER_01]: respond immediately and say this is
totally out of bounds, totally
[SPEAKER_01]: unconstitutional, totally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city attorney, the city council,
whoever it would have said to the chief of
[SPEAKER_01]: police, stop this activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they've supported it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've said, oh, he's doing the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Ninth Circuit will hear the appeals
March the 5th and then we have to wait for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to issue a ruling, which I think
we're fairly confident is going to reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: the dismissals and return the cases for
trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ninth Circuit is moving a little
slower than normal these days because the
[SPEAKER_01]: Republicans in Congress won't confirm
judges for the Ninth Circuit, so they're
[SPEAKER_01]: short about a third of their judges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would hope we'd have a ruling
perhaps somewhere near the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year, September, October of 98,
we'd have a ruling and be back down at the
[SPEAKER_01]: district court level and then make the
city work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like you say that, you know,
the fact that the city has gone this far,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just shocking that,
you know, it's costing the taxpayers all
[SPEAKER_03]: this money to defend a case which,
you know, should have never gone on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know if the Ninth Circuit's coming to
hear any other cases or is this the?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Ninth Circuit is here for a whole
group of cases and they will be sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: here during that week of March the 5th,
Monday through Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come up to listen to cases where the
parties are in Oregon to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: convenient for the parties so they don't
all have to come to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do know that the Ninth Circuit
recent rulings on the Civil Rights Act
[SPEAKER_01]: have been fairly closely aligned with our
arguments to the Ninth Circuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an act that was designed to
prevent the suppression of unpopular
[SPEAKER_01]: political movements.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out of the time when the Ku Klux
Klan was in control or very influential
[SPEAKER_01]: over southern governments right after the
slaves had been released and the law was
[SPEAKER_01]: written to protect both ex-slaves that
were trying to gain their full citizenship
[SPEAKER_01]: rights and the Republican Party,
which at that time was trying to help the
[SPEAKER_01]: Afro-American population of the South
achieve full citizenship.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very different Republican Party
today, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the law was designed both to protect
people suffering discrimination and to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect political groups in an unpopular
situation where they were suffering from
[SPEAKER_01]: official repression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we view the case as really the
anti-Himp Reform movement having taken
[SPEAKER_01]: over the government of Portland and the
pro-Himp Reform movement suffering from
[SPEAKER_01]: official government repression by this
party that's taken power and that that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: classic model for applying the civil
rights law.
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly seems to me that anybody,
the city government, has said that anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: who's out to reform the Hemp laws is fair
game for the police department.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important for people in
Portland to realize however you feel about
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp, if they can do this to the Hemp
Reform movement today, they can do it to
[SPEAKER_01]: you tomorrow, whatever your particular
cause may be, if it's unpopular with those
[SPEAKER_01]: who hold power and control the police
department.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're talking about is repeated
arrests, a seizure of materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this glorious First Amendment
incident with the Mount Tabor Pub,
[SPEAKER_01]: which at the time was owned and operated
by Mark Meek and had a temporary liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came to him with the presidents of
two neighborhood associations,
[SPEAKER_01]: the police officer that is the liaison to
the State Liquor Commission and the city
[SPEAKER_01]: employee that's in charge of liquor
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they told him that he had to take down
the handbills that were posted in the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood for something called Hemp
Awareness Week, which was going to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: event at Mount Tabor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had, he had to take the word Hemp off
of the marquee of the Mount Tabor Pub and
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had to prevent Floyd Landreth from
speaking at the event to be held there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the word Hemp itself had become their
target and they didn't want the word
[SPEAKER_01]: displayed in public leaflets or on the
marquee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the police and city officials were
there with the neighborhood association
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership to say, you can't use this
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a phenomenal incident of a First
Amendment violation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all too often, the marijuana
prohibition is used to expand police
[SPEAKER_04]: intrusion and desecration of our civil
rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, what we're trying to do is
circulate a petition to stop that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to interrupt you,
but I just want to plug our initiative
[SPEAKER_04]: petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need your help to put the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please give us a call.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd like to send you our petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call us at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need help.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to pay petitioners.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need financial assistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you'd like us to send you
petitions, we'd be happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also watch this TV show and print
our petition from the internet if you have
[SPEAKER_04]: internet access.
[SPEAKER_04]: So look at www.crrh.org to see just a huge
resource in terms of information on the
[SPEAKER_04]: internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only is this TV series on our website,
but we also have ABC's special Pot of
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold, CNN's special Higher Times,
the movie Reefer Madness from the 30s,
[SPEAKER_04]: a USDA World War II movie from 43,
called Hemp for Victory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, there's over 50 different
videos available there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've got a modem, you can watch
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back to the case there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Lanny, you worked with the
Christich Institute in Washington,
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you were the director of litigation for
that and helped publicize some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Iran-Contra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there for five years and we worked
on the Iran-Contra case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's again the same issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's do we have a democracy in this
country?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have a republic in this country
where the power remains with the people
[SPEAKER_01]: even when they delegated to the
government?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is the government up for grabs by those
that have their own private agenda for
[SPEAKER_01]: world domination, economic domination,
whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the government going to be their tool
regardless of what the people want or what
[SPEAKER_01]: the people think?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the war on drugs, as Paul Stanford
mentioned, has become a tool for political
[SPEAKER_01]: repression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can even move it up into the
spiritual realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: In looking at a lot of the things going on
around the world and to the planet,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the planet, I think that part of the
reason there's a marijuana suppression
[SPEAKER_01]: movement is that for some people,
not for all people, but for some people,
[SPEAKER_01]: the experience of smoking marijuana has
brought them closer to identifying with
[SPEAKER_01]: the earth and connecting to the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the more you identify and connect
with the earth, the more you are prepared
[SPEAKER_01]: to oppose the corporate programs for
dismantling the earth, consuming the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, chewing it up, polluting it,
all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that therefore, that experience
represents a danger to corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: domination of the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the marijuana suppression
movement is in part motivated by a
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritual worship of the death of the
planet versus those that relate to the
[SPEAKER_01]: life of the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can take that dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that only through an ability to
articulate those kind of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: to approach people with why marijuana
should be legalized, regulated,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever approach you want to take,
and have the right to speak and convince
[SPEAKER_01]: people, can we stop this death-worshipping
corporate culture from devouring the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the American political system,
the United States political system,
[SPEAKER_01]: was supposedly designed so that ideas
would compete with each other in an
[SPEAKER_01]: impartial, neutral playing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, that's not what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city of Portland has taken sides and
put public resources on one side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope that this lawsuit will stop
them and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope that coming out of this lawsuit,
people trying to campaign on the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: issue will be viewed as deserving the
protection of the Civil Rights Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that that will be useful to people all
over the country if we can get that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of ruling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just wanted to go back for a
second to, you know, you said that with
[SPEAKER_03]: the spiritual realm, that for some people
who partake of marijuana, it affords them
[SPEAKER_03]: a closer connection with the planet Earth,
which would make sense when you stop and
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the history of humans as a race,
as a separate species.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first plants that scientists
agree that was domesticated by humans was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was, you know, at the time
when we had a much closer connection to
[SPEAKER_03]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one of the first plants that
we realized was sacred to us and of many
[SPEAKER_03]: uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so therefore, even today, it kind of
relates for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people, like you say, it relates back
to that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, over in Hawaii, we have a church
that has been set up around the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there have been various cases brought.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a prosecution now underway of the
chief minister of that church.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the higher courts have not upheld it
as a spiritual practice to use hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect that's eventually going to go to
the United States Supreme Court,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there'll be different rulings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there is a spiritual
dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fortunate in living in Hawaii,
we have such a high spiritual content in
[SPEAKER_01]: the very atmosphere we live in on a daily
basis that stimulants are hardly
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people, however, and other
environments, I think, find it useful as a
[SPEAKER_01]: way of breaking through barriers that are
set up by a highly intellectualized
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, where we get so up in our minds
that we lose touch with the flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: the trees and the dolphins and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it offers an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, the bottom line is,
if you're engaged in something that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: harming someone else, it's not the state's
business to tell you yay or nay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are your decisions and what we call
victimless crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people who have used victimless
crimes as a tool to enact repressive laws
[SPEAKER_01]: and gain more power over people and make
people afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you make people afraid about
one thing, the more you make them afraid
[SPEAKER_01]: about another, and the more you can get
them to act out of fear rather than out of
[SPEAKER_01]: love or a higher purpose, the more you get
them to conform to a police state
[SPEAKER_01]: mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it relates back to our lawsuit with
the civil rights case for hemp activists,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the Civil Rights Act, like you
said, came out of, for ex-slaves and
[SPEAKER_03]: Republicans trying to help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sort of like a status.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were an ex-slave, you could be
oppressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what they were trying to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same thing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you happen to be a campaigner for the
change of hemp laws, you could be
[SPEAKER_03]: oppressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We must remember to make that point to the
Ninth Circuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a status offense now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a hemp activist, you're fair
game.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: No other political movement has to deal
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out there petitioning, as are many of
our activists across the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no other political movement has to
deal with the paranoia that our supporters
[SPEAKER_04]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I would say only one out of
three people who want to sign our petition
[SPEAKER_04]: will actually sign it because they're
afraid to see their name on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, our opponents say that, you know,
that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in fact, paranoia is one of the things
that scares a lot of people from helping
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to urge people that we have to
stand up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're circulating this petition,
and we need your help right now to put it
[SPEAKER_04]: out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So flash the number on the screen,
please, and call that number, 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're outside the Portland area,
call 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we were talking about flowers
just a moment ago and the spiritual use of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, you know, and how that
contributes to corporate death culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing with industrial hemp right
now in several countries, they're
[SPEAKER_04]: starting, including Canada this year,
they're starting to allow commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they limit the THC level that's in the
hemp plants to 0.3, three-tenths of one
[SPEAKER_04]: percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, by doing that, the only way you can
limit a hemp plant or a marijuana plant to
[SPEAKER_04]: that low a level of THC is you got to
breed it, breed out the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you breed out the flowers, you don't
have as much THC because there's more THC
[SPEAKER_04]: in the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, by breeding out the flowers,
that means it doesn't have seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't have an industrial hemp
crop with the low THC strains only produce
[SPEAKER_04]: about 600 pounds of seeds, while a Notre
Dame study in 75 on the wild hemp fields
[SPEAKER_04]: of southern Illinois showed that those
wild hemp fields produce over four tons of
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds per acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you take that four tons of seed and
you press it and you get over 700 gallons
[SPEAKER_04]: of oil that will drive any diesel engine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, I believe, is another key reason
that hemp is prohibited is because the
[SPEAKER_04]: petrochemical industries don't want to
deal with biodiesel and hemp producing
[SPEAKER_04]: produces more than three times more
biodiesel or vegetable oil fuel,
[SPEAKER_04]: which doesn't take any conversion at all
to run an internal combustion diesel
[SPEAKER_04]: engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably smells better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like French fries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells much, much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp oil also has many medicinal and
nutritional qualities as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it goes rancid, when it's not a
good food anymore, it's a good fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really interesting now is why they're
saying that it should only be this
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial hemp to be with no flowering
tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call me crazy, but it seems kind of
cruel to a plant not to allow it to get to
[SPEAKER_03]: the flower point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these industrial or these wild
hemp fields in Kansas, Nebraska,
[SPEAKER_03]: southern Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still low THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're only like one and a half percent,
which is still not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they want to limit it so that the
petrochemical industries don't have to
[SPEAKER_04]: compete.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only real reason there can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you go back to the original
making of hemp illegal and the campaign to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it illegal and the petrochemical
industry and the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_01]: involving themselves in that campaign
because hemp was coming on so strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cotton growing states too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's new machinery that made hemp a
fraction of its former price.
[SPEAKER_04]: It dropped a hundredfold from 50 cents a
ton down to a half a cent a ton.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so suddenly it was competitive and
they had to stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to know these kinds of
historical facts because much of what is
[SPEAKER_01]: being done now, having been based
originally on a lie and based on an
[SPEAKER_01]: economic motivation has led to a
continuing propaganda campaign with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of lies, a lot of fear, a lot of
manipulation when in fact underlying it is
[SPEAKER_01]: often a very strong political agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: The partnership for a drug free America
heavily funded by alcohol and
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical interests, tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people who would be harmed by
hemp being allowed to compete with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know the truth and they don't care
about the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they care about is protecting their
economic interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like you say, remembering the
history is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear it said about other civil rights
movements out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of the first things that an
oppressed people loses is their history.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a sense, one of the first things that
we lost as marijuana activists and
[SPEAKER_03]: advocates, we lost our history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these only thanks to some people like
Jack Herrera going back or doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: research able to bring back up all this
wonderful information about hemp and
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the name of that book?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first edition of that was written in
my house way back in 85.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to remind people to call us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always have to stress this because we
need your help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever you are, help us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Lanny, I hope you can come back
for the next show as well for next week's
[SPEAKER_04]: episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd like to talk a little bit more
about the court case and some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: incidents regarding our initiative that
this civil rights suit that the Federal
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is coming
here to Portland to hear this.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we first announced we were going to
have this petition drive, the only
[SPEAKER_04]: opposition they had in the media was from
the police and several police agencies
[SPEAKER_04]: came forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even after this suit, as recently as a
town hall show that was filmed recently by
[SPEAKER_04]: local KATU TV, the police come forward and
oppose our initiative and are using their
[SPEAKER_04]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, when I went on town hall,
I had a DEA agent sitting next to me and
[SPEAKER_04]: next to him was a captain in the Portland
police drug and vice unit and then another
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon State trooper.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the main people up front and
center opposing us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has a very chilling effect on our
activists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, we only get one out of three
people who say they want to sign our
[SPEAKER_04]: petition because they say they're afraid
and they're there trying to escalate that
[SPEAKER_04]: fear by coming out and being our main
opponents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of what people need to understand in
the constitutional dimension of this case,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the elements, Article Four of the
United States Constitution guarantees a
[SPEAKER_01]: Republican form of government.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means is that you may delegate
power to a representative government,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the representative government still
must acknowledge that the power resides in
[SPEAKER_01]: the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the forces of government,
the resources of government are only to be
[SPEAKER_01]: used on an impartial basis regarding the
general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not to be put at the service of
any one faction within the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see police officers in
uniform, the case where we were seeking
[SPEAKER_01]: the injunction started when the last
initiative was announced to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp laws and the television stations went
to the police station and out came Officer
[SPEAKER_01]: Jensen, who was the official spokesman for
the police department in uniform,
[SPEAKER_01]: making a statement denigrating the motives
of the people who were putting forward
[SPEAKER_01]: this initiative, discouraging people from
signing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a use of his official position,
which he's paid for by all the taxpayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are pro-hemp, anti-hemp,
or neutral, are all paying his salary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's using his position and that
publicly paid time to take a partisan
[SPEAKER_01]: position on an initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's against state law in Oregon,
but more fundamentally it's
[SPEAKER_01]: unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: That when the government is allowed to use
public resources to present only one side
[SPEAKER_01]: of an issue or to appear, as Paul's just
talking about, in opposition to another
[SPEAKER_01]: side of an issue, you have a very big
constitutional problem on your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we said about the earlier
violations of civil rights, if they can do
[SPEAKER_01]: that to the hemp movement today,
they can do it to you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to put up an initiative for
anything and the official state policy is
[SPEAKER_01]: to oppose you and they can put state
officials on state time into a debate with
[SPEAKER_01]: you, spend state money to oppose you,
then it's a one-sided campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a level playing ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, you really should not allow
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hope that people would tell
the city of Portland and the state police
[SPEAKER_01]: that they should not be appearing in these
kinds of forums to campaign for one side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's definitely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the police have got to stay out
of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not only state law.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, like you say, it's constitutional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all got to stand up for that and
tell them no whenever we see them on TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks for watching, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, give us a phone call at
503-235-4606 and get our initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come down and meet Bruce, our office
manager, and help out in the office
[SPEAKER_03]: stuffing envelopes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll mail you copies of petition if
you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can help go out and get signatures
on our initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the address?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's our address?
[SPEAKER_03]: P.O.
[SPEAKER_03]: Box?
[SPEAKER_04]: The mailing address is CRRH at P.O.
[SPEAKER_04]: Box 86714, Portland, Oregon, 97286,
right there on your screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So write that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a call.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be happy to send you out some
petitions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we have until the end of June
and we're really pushing our petitions to
drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call us and help us put this on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks for coming, Lanny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to thank both of you attorneys
for standing up for all of us and our
[SPEAKER_04]: civil rights and taking on these forces
and taking them into the courts and now
[SPEAKER_04]: getting this to a oral argument to the
court of appeals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.
Good night.
