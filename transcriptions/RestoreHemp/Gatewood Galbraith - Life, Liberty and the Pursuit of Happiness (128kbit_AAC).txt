[SPEAKER_01]: I've been practicing law for 30 years,
been protecting the rights of the
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana smoker since that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran in 1983 for Commissioner of
Agriculture of Marijuana on a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you, in 1983, that didn't go
over too damn hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Galbraith, how do you expect to
win?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, there's more marijuana
smokers than there are Republicans in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can just get them to the polls,
we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I've run, I've ran in 91,
95 for governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ran in 99 as a reform party candidate for
governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spent $20,000 and got 15.3% of the vote as
a third party.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kentucky, that was pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ran as an independent for Congress in
2002, got 27% of the vote as an
[SPEAKER_01]: independent on a $20,000 budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm running this time as an independent
for governor of the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you, I was mighty
impressed to hear these words.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Madeleine because she's got it
exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is just a symptom of the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real issue is, are we still sovereign
human beings?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the American Revolution was
all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is an iconic issue because it
shows just how far the government has gone
[SPEAKER_01]: in overstepping its bounds in policing
private behavior and impinging on the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole idea of what America itself was all
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before America, we were all property.
[SPEAKER_01]: We belonged to the king or the queen or
the warlord or whoever had the most
[SPEAKER_01]: gunpowder in the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, hey, come in here,
off with your head, there you went.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing, you had no rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were property.
[SPEAKER_01]: You belonged to whoever had the most
gunpowder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when our founding fathers decided that
they were gonna set this country up and
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote the Declaration of Independence,
they recognized in essence that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: all created by our creator and endowed
with inalienable human rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among them, life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first time, they gave each of us
our sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_01]: For there was a first time any ruling
party had ever conceded that the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual was a sovereign thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wrote the constitution to try to
instill the legal system to protect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since that time, it has been in great
peril by people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who seek to subvert it and make slaves of
us to their will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe you me, the man ain't racist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't care what color his slaves are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole idea of having piss in the
cup to hold a job in America is anathema
[SPEAKER_01]: to what America itself was built on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been at this, I was 24 years old and
a milkman in 1971 when I decided I was
[SPEAKER_01]: grist for the mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to end up in prison or dead at
an early age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't understand the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as I was ignorant of the
system, I was gonna be a pawn in their
[SPEAKER_01]: game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided I had to learn the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way to do that was to go to
college and become an attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I was gonna do that and put in all
that work, I might as well become governor
[SPEAKER_01]: of Kentucky and change marijuana laws and
try to lift Kentucky back into prosperity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the world's largest producer of
cannabis for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called it hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: People said, what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, hemp and marijuana are
both cannabis in the same way that Danny
[SPEAKER_01]: DeVito and Dennis Rodman are both adult
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky was the world's largest producer,
so we ought to return to it and let our
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers back into the niche of producing
energy to solve our energy problems
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of giving all this marijuana,
giving all this money over to the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: producing countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We calculated that if you could plant 7%
of the US agricultural land in hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wouldn't have to import another drop
of oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's happened is a great synthetic
subversion where those people who make
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic products have used the criminal
law to criminalize farmers from producing
[SPEAKER_01]: competitive natural products in both
petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a great deal of our problems today
could be directly associated to the people
[SPEAKER_01]: I refer to as the petrochemical
pharmaceutical military industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: transnational corporate fascist elite son
of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have never said the pledge of
allegiance to the flag of the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States of America or to the Republic for
which it stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not warm and fuzzy about us or our
children or grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they see the Constitution and the Bill
of Rights as impediments to the
[SPEAKER_01]: implementation of a new world order in the
global economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to flatten the world to make us
all a global economy and to erase national
[SPEAKER_01]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they can't afford to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't afford to give every other
human being on earth the same
[SPEAKER_01]: constitutional privileges and rights that
we enjoy and recognition of sovereign
[SPEAKER_01]: human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to have to take ours away
from us in order to make us a flat earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't going down without a fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 1983, like I said, I started my
political campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got up, I started getting up every day
in 1971.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been at it 40 years and I've run
for governor several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a pretty good idea about what
politics is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave the keynote address at the Reform
Party National Convention back in 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've observed the politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after 40 years, I'd have to be pretty
dumb not to have come up with at least one
[SPEAKER_01]: good idea in those 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do tell the folks in this race right
here, if I was ever going to lie to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would already have been elected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But descriptively speaking, Kentucky
suffers from electile dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happened is that both parties have
their horns locked up like two bull elk
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting over territory while the business
of the people lays dead in the dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And neither party can produce a candidate
who disengaged from the partisanship long
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to work with the other side to get
the job done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my running mate, who's a beautiful
lady with six kids, two of them adopted,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of her natural children's special
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she knows where the rubber beats the
road in those women and children's issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: She and I are running totally as
independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no party affiliation whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want all that baggage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want all that, all that
corruption.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really, we don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want it to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a monster to be fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get to the trough, you know,
we're going to start returning any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: surpluses of the state over back over to
the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing I'm going to do when
I'm governor of the state of Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_01]: the minute I'm sworn in to oath is I'm
going to have the commander of the
[SPEAKER_01]: National Guard land a helicopter in front
of the Capitol and bring me the keys to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the last time any one of those
frigate military helicopters is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hover over the fields and gardens of the
people of the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is America, not Afghanistan,
and we're not occupied territory and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to treat our citizens like we
are when in the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a pretty good idea that I mean
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote an autobiography here not too long
ago that I gave a copy to Madeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my autobiography.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called The Last Free Man in America
Meets the Synthetic Subversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's me holding the M-60 on the
front cover of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a guy with why you hold that
M-60 is that because I'm a serious man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can get that order one off of
my website gatewood.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a hell of a chance of winning
in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our primaries are this coming Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not in the primary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're totally independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what interest you may have in what how
I do out there in that race is that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take a giant leap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a giant leap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: To find out whether America still has a
pulse or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do it constitutionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The United States Constitution does not
provide you the right to life,
[SPEAKER_01]: liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the Declaration of Independence.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't officially have a right to
that under federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Kentucky has a Constitution also just
like all the other states do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just so happens that Kentucky's
Constitution is the most pro-people
[SPEAKER_01]: Constitution ever written.
[SPEAKER_01]: That our people back in 1890 got so tired
of being raped by the railroad companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that they wrote a Constitution that
protected the people and kept corporations
[SPEAKER_01]: from being running roughshod over
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even now that's beginning to fracture
as our legislature keeps selling out to
[SPEAKER_01]: the folks that I call the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_01]: transnational, corporate fascist elite son
of a bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going to happen is that the very
first section of Kentucky's Constitution
[SPEAKER_01]: ensures that its citizens constitutionally
are endowed with the right to life,
[SPEAKER_01]: liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the number one section in
Kentucky's Constitution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel obliged to make it the number
one basis of policy for my relationship of
[SPEAKER_01]: government to the people and state of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get it off of their backs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take it out of the bedrooms
and the bloodstreams and the brains and
[SPEAKER_01]: the bladders and the billfolds and back
pockets and the internet bulletin boards
[SPEAKER_01]: and put them back in the little box where
they belong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make government not a burden
on the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the role of government to
uplift, enlighten, educate, and endow
[SPEAKER_01]: people with an appreciation of life,
appreciation of the social compact,
[SPEAKER_01]: their civil duties, their civil
responsibilities, and make sure that we
[SPEAKER_01]: address them as sovereign human beings
capable of making their own decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to get medical marijuana
in the hands of every sick and dying
[SPEAKER_01]: person in the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: No permit needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take it out of the hands of
the 10 and 13 and 14 year olds who are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it just for kicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give them over to the old
age homes, to all the old folks in the old
[SPEAKER_01]: age homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, increase the appetite, put a smile on
their face, and think about the increased
[SPEAKER_01]: visitation by the young folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's go see dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could do this, if I can win this,
it's going to be bigger than Ventura.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be next to Obama's election because
there was an independent elected governor
[SPEAKER_01]: of Rhode Island in this past when the
first one elected in 150 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he had been a state senator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had been a US senator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was from the state of Rhode Island,
so he had that base.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be the first truly independent
ticket ever to win governor in the state
[SPEAKER_01]: of Kentucky in the last 150 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a website called gatewood.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a criminal defense attorney out of
Lexington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I handle criminal cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to represent a lottery winner or
two, if any of you all know who you are
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a big dog and you're hanging out
on millions, here's a good place to give
[SPEAKER_01]: me a fee and let me get on down the road
on this campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can drop something, five,
10, 20 bucks in on gatewood.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you a copy of my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: An ex-governor of the state of Kentucky
said it was the best statement of freedom
[SPEAKER_01]: in America that he'd ever read.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the same day, an 18-year-old girl from
the middle of the mountains called me,
[SPEAKER_01]: said she had read it twice previous week,
and it was the number one seller at Joseph
[SPEAKER_01]: Beth's Top Independent Bookstore in
America for 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I left out 100% of the sex and 8% of
the drugs, but it's still a kick-ass read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks, I'm out here at the bequest of and
the generosity of somebody that I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly like to give a shout-out to,
and that's Mr. Paul Stanford here in
[SPEAKER_01]: August.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was swell enough to let me appear on
his program last night, and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: throw a little fundraiser over to Clinton.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Clinton Street Theater, what time?
[SPEAKER_01]: At 3.30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the 5.30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I understand you all got
some business to conduct at the meeting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just, I hope I didn't take up too
much of your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gatewood, Galbraith, I appreciate you
all's time and attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
