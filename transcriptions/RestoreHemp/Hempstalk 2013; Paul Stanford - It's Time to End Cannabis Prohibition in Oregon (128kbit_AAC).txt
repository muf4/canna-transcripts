[SPEAKER_00]: We are here today to celebrate hemp and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also happy to announce the
launch of the campaign to put this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: back on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last November, we got 47% of the vote
statewide.
[SPEAKER_00]: 61% right here in Multnomah County,
63% in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Portland loves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might as well just take the R out of
Portland right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we just launched,
we got approval yesterday afternoon at 445
[SPEAKER_00]: to circulate our petition to legalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have two petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a statutory measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one's a constitutional
amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, our constitutional amendment
basically says that you can possess,
[SPEAKER_00]: use and grow marijuana and the state can
enact laws to regulate the sale of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana to adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the statutory measure is almost
exactly like measure 80 last year with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of changes to make our opposition's
arguments disappear to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it looks possible at this stage
that next February, our Oregon legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: will put a bill out there and refer a bill
to regulate marijuana to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they don't, then we've got two
initiatives ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the legislature puts a bill out there,
we will stop our statutory measure,
[SPEAKER_00]: just move forward with the constitutional
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't, you know, we're trying to
put pressure on them to act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several legislators have said they
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, we don't have any guarantees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a guarantee that if we get
over 82,000 valid Oregon voter signatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can put that statutory measure on the
ballot again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we get over 116,000 signatures,
then we can put the constitutional
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to make the people of our
state vote twice to legalize marijuana in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the legislature doesn't do it,
we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, PIP, cannabis,
marijuana are really the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great friend of mine, Kentucky Attorney
Gatewood-Galbraith, named the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: were really responsible for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: trans, national, corporate, elite,
fascist sons of bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sold us that there was a deadly
new drug called marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was based on this anti-hysterical
romantic racism that they use this word,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they'd said hip, they never would have
been able to criminalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they created this to protect
the petrochemical and wood fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they said it was a deadly new drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it's the oldest crop known to
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All archaeologists agree that marijuana
has been cultivated at least 12,000 years
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe over 30,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the first agricultural crop,
it might be the very reason that our
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors gave up the hunter-gatherer way
of life and started planting plants so
[SPEAKER_00]: they could have a stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could have, you know,
they found frozen remains in tombs where
[SPEAKER_00]: the people are buried or die carrying
their herb with them the same way I will
[SPEAKER_00]: be found carrying my herb with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth of the matter is that it's
really about fuel and fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drugs are just a smoke screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about money, power,
and the continued centralization of
[SPEAKER_00]: economic and political control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our initiatives are out there,
and we need you to get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go right over to the booth with the
American flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign that petition, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not registered to vote,
get registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to register and vote and take
this system back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more of us that register,
the sooner that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank all our vendors out
there who've come out here and made this
[SPEAKER_00]: all possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran into a lot of roadblocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost us a lot of money at the last
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city actually came forward and
required that we hire 30 additional
[SPEAKER_00]: security people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told us last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also said we have to pay $4,000 plus
dollars for a parking patrol to give us
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets out on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically dropped $30,000 worth of
bills on us at the last minute trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, if you don't do it, no permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I just want you to know it
takes a lot of volunteer effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of volunteer work, and as several
people have said for this stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom isn't free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly being assaulted,
and it's two steps forward and one step
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're seeing some steps forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The votes in Washington and Colorado have
changed the whole dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got 47% of the vote last
November, but recent polls have shown that
[SPEAKER_00]: the support for cannabis legalization now
is up over 63%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put something on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know we're going to win next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So help us do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get involved, register to vote,
help us circulate this petition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and help us restore him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
