[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like to talk about today to
all of you is that we need to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand that in order for
what we're doing here at the state level
[SPEAKER_00]: to be truly successful, we need to make
changes at the national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to back Representative Blumenauer
in his project and we need to reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: states outside of Oregon and let them know
that there's hope for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That by descheduling cannabis and by
allowing states to decide how cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be regulated across the nation,
we open up doors for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would eliminate the moratoriums that
we're seeing on medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries here in Oregon right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 138 cities have enacted a moratorium for a
year on dispensaries because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think that there's enough regulation under
the new rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about you guys, but I read
those rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of rules there to regulate
cannabis, to keep it away from kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it safer access for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would suggest that although we do
need to fight that battle, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: fight the battle at the national level
even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once those restrictions are
removed, you'll see that explosion that
[SPEAKER_00]: Congressman Blumenauer was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are on the verge of that explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law enforcement may not like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that don't like it,
but it's coming whether they like it or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it comes about will be up to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the capability of having a huge
impact on what that's going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that these moratoriums are
happening and the reason that the law is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tighter than we would like it is
because enough of us weren't there talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't go talk to our legislators and
let them know what we really wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess who was there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what they like to do to us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw us in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, as you're moving forward,
if you've never done anything as an
[SPEAKER_00]: activist before in your life besides come
to one of these marches, I would suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe you take one little step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to be heard by someone other
than this group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that by sending an email to
your congressman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find information so that you
can be an informed speaker about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: just by Googling cannabis and the disease
of your choice or cannabis and penalties
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabis and children or all of those
myths that we've heard all these years
[SPEAKER_00]: have been disproved, every single one of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to spread that word across the
entire country, bigger than Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger than anything we can see here and
we won't see changes that we had not even
[SPEAKER_00]: imagined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the verge of those changes,
we see groups like the Normal Women's
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance who is working this year to start
a program that deals with women and
[SPEAKER_00]: pregnancy and children with special needs
and mediation and arbitration for women
[SPEAKER_00]: who end up in prison for cannabis laws
because they answered their boyfriend's
[SPEAKER_00]: phone who was making a dope deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women are also part of the group that are
marginalized in this cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because along with people of color,
women are going to jail who haven't even
[SPEAKER_00]: used cannabis, like I said, just for
answering the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Families are getting torn apart and that
needs to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that by contacting your
congressman, by contacting your local
[SPEAKER_00]: representative, by helping out groups like
Parents for a Pot who is just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a booth over here and we would
love to talk to you about what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to become a resource as cannabis
legalization moves forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents are going to need to go someplace
to figure out how to talk to their kids
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis and that's what Parents for
a Pot is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Normal Women's Alliance is another
group of women who have come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis closet and I would suggest to
everybody here that if you haven't done
[SPEAKER_00]: that, find a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you only do it with one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you only tell your best friend who
never knew that you smoked weed that you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a step in the right direction and
it's going to be the rock in the pond
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to move ever outward until
finally we are free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to hear that word,
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what it's really about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about I like to eat my brownies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about I want to smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about personal freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have to have a drug test
because I work in an office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither should you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to do what we want when
we go home at night as long as it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know about you guys but the
only way I hurt somebody if I smoke a bowl
[SPEAKER_00]: at home is if I accidentally burn their
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay but what I would like to say really
is that I hope that you will all,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who comes here gets excited
about the march and we're excited to be
[SPEAKER_00]: marching in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your really great buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go home from the office and
you're thinking about what happened here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you will take the opportunity
to reach out to your representatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: to speak to them and let them know how you
feel about cannabis laws, to let people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are running for office know that if
they do not support our ideas,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to get elected.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Anna Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a proud Stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me and let's end cannabis
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
