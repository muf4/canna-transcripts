[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Steves grew up in Edmonds,
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studied at the University of Washington
where he received degrees in business
[SPEAKER_00]: administration in European history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today he employs 80 people at his Europe
through the back door headquarters where
[SPEAKER_00]: he produces over 50 guidebooks on European
travel, the most popular travel series in
[SPEAKER_00]: America on public television.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has a weekly long national public
radio show and a weekly column syndicated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Chicago Tribune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick is also a great advocate for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking around the state and country he
is on the normal advisory board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Steves lives and works in his
hometown of Edmonds, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up to Rick Steves!
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a warm welcome!
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fast, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm a travel writer and for me high
is a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a place where I can cook well.
[SPEAKER_01]: My speakers sound better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a place where conversations slither
around like straight cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I want to go to that place and a
lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our government says we can't go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today 80,000 Americans who wanted to
go to that place and went there are in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail in our country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are scenarios where I think it's
okay for our government to say you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there better be a good reason when my
government says I can't go somewhere and
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to getting high I don't
think there's a good reason for our
[SPEAKER_01]: government to say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that the mature, responsible,
adult, recreational use of marijuana is a
[SPEAKER_01]: civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a drug and I'm not promoting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I acknowledge it's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be abused.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for kids and if you drive
intoxicated by anything they should throw
[SPEAKER_01]: the book at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't get in the way from the
principle that enjoying marijuana is a
[SPEAKER_01]: civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we need to communicate to
our society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now our government is waging a war against
marijuana, a perpetual never-ending losing
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive, demoralizing to our police
force, eroding credibility to our teachers
[SPEAKER_01]: and parents, war on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a war based on lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a war that cost our society billions
of dollars every year and it's a war that
[SPEAKER_01]: messes up hundreds of thousands of
American lives every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year alone 800,000 Americans were
arrested for enjoying marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a criminal record now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I bring a European perspective to the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent a third of my life hanging out
in Europe with people who think marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: is about exciting as a can of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you think about the European
approach to drug problems and they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: drug problems just like we've got drug
problems, they measure their drug problems
[SPEAKER_01]: or the success of their policies on drugs,
not by how many people do you lock up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they measure it based on a concept
called harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a radical difference between our
and their approach to drug abuse and drug
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe they want to take the crime out
of the equation and consider it a health
[SPEAKER_01]: problem and an education challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my European friends tell me time and
time again that a society has to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: choice, tolerate alternative lifestyles or
build more prisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they always needle me with that
annoying little comment that, and in your
[SPEAKER_01]: country, the United States of America,
you lock up more people than anybody else
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lock up eight times as many people per
capita as Europeans do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either we're inherently more criminal or
there's something screwy about our laws
[SPEAKER_01]: and most of those people in our jails are
in there on drug charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what shapes American policy on drugs?
Fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fear is a huge thing in our society and
it's a big part of this war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generations of reaper madness,
propaganda and lies have been designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: make people who have not paid very careful
attention to this issue simply afraid of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of Americans who think
there's a whole reservoir of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: would just love to ruin their lives with
drug abuse if only it was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in Portugal they decriminalized,
they legalized consumption of all drugs 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago and you know what they learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: More people don't use drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just no longer a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty big revelation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of Americans think that marijuana is
a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of tokes and all of a sudden
you're a heroin addict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well in the Netherlands it's been 25 years
since they've arrested anybody for smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: pot and they've got a track record.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about it as much as we do and
they found that not many more people smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and not any more people are into
hard drugs and their hard drug taking
[SPEAKER_01]: population is aging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a successful thing when you take the
crime out of the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if marijuana is a gateway drug it's
only a gateway drug because it's illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: because that means there's criminals on
the street with a vested interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: getting you into marijuana so you can get
into more profitable more expensive and
[SPEAKER_01]: more addictive drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing gateway about marijuana is
its illegality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the United States is out of sync with
the world and we need to wake America up
[SPEAKER_01]: and tell them that there is a harm
reduction approach to drug abuse that is
[SPEAKER_01]: more effective and pragmatic than locking
people up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemfest is a wonderful celebration of
cannabis culture but I'll tell you we're
[SPEAKER_01]: never going to legalize things unless you
guys mobilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great party it's a lot of fun
but you got to go out there and make it
[SPEAKER_01]: not scary and you got to get the truth
through to people in the suburbs who are
[SPEAKER_01]: scared to death about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need to support advocacy groups
with our money so they can wage our battle
[SPEAKER_01]: for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a board member of normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 10 years I've been a board member of
normal and I'll tell you those advocacy
[SPEAKER_01]: groups that are fighting against the drug
war in our country are not charities
[SPEAKER_01]: they're services and they're fighting your
battle and they're waging a courageous and
[SPEAKER_01]: dogged struggle in our state house and in
our national government.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at a crossroads right now in our
society just like we were in the 1930s
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were taking down the laws against
alcohol and courageous people are starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to speak out now and it's an exciting
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor LaGuardia of New York in the 1930s
said that if a society has a law on the
[SPEAKER_01]: books that it does not intend to enforce
consistently across the board the very
[SPEAKER_01]: existence of that law corrodes law
enforcement and respect of the law in
[SPEAKER_01]: general in a society.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no intentions of enforcing our
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to lock up all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they did that tomorrow Seattle would be
a much less interesting city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a hardworking kid raising church going
tax paying citizen of the United States of
[SPEAKER_01]: America and if I work all day and want to
go home and enjoy a joint that's my civil
[SPEAKER_01]: liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not hard on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not soft on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to inject a little bit of
European common sense and pragmatism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to see drugs as a health problem
not a criminal issue and then we can move
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond hard on drugs and soft on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can be smart on drugs all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun and happy travels even if you're
just staying home.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
