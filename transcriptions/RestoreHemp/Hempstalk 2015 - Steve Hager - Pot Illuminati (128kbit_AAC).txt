[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is just the tip of the iceberg,
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the great hoodwink of what
they've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoners domesticated the horse,
invented the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoners created blues, jazz, rock and roll
out of Congo Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoners created hip hop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoners created the personal computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoners created the first secular music.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoners own magic and religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been taken away from that
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: All religions came from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, they've disappeared the fact
that the burning bush, which gave Moses
[SPEAKER_00]: the inspiration, was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma of the Rig Veda, the oldest living
religious document, the foundation of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hinduism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Buddhism is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ma is cannabis in Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we get Magi, magic,
shaman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we rule magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis people of the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's take back the magic,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I got my own little project now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Pada Luminati.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stealing the magic of the evil
spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Pada Luminati.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're bending it to our will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just established a chapter here in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: These candles will be used by the Portland
chapter of the Pada Luminati.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the sophisticated magic
that we've manifested in the 20 years I
[SPEAKER_00]: ran the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're bringing the crew that did the
ceremonies at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're coming here next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're bringing the founding fathers of
the Pada Luminati.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandmaster Kaz and Chief Rocker Busy B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: These figures are so important because
they created the culture and got no big
[SPEAKER_00]: money out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they're very magical creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first journalist to go to the
South Bronx and interview all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: founding fathers of hip hop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a book here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete history of the first
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody into hip hop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody like to copy this book?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know Abraham Lincoln was killed by
his own party?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was going to bring the southern
congressmen back into congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radical republicans were about to lose
control of congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, through their double agents,
they sent a confederate spy, John Wilkes
[SPEAKER_00]: Booth, to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they left the president unprotected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had to kill John Wilkes Booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't let him be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like they couldn't let Oswald be
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody want to know the real history?
[SPEAKER_00]: What really happened in the Civil War?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my adventure through magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started, I came through experimental
theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I studied with Julian Beck, Judith Molina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasper Grutfeld, the provost in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rode with the Mary Pranksters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I began my career as a counterculture
shaman in magic in 1967.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have continued and created the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have done things on a massive scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the story of what I learned in
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody want a copy of this book?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to know what the real story
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who runs the banks?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the real story behind the Wizard of
Oz?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these secret societies?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the Illuminati?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Illuminati is just a chapter of
Freemasonry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freemasonry is the shadow that they
created on the other side of
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentalist religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like Christianity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only it's, you know, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only it's a different kind of a hoodwink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't telling you the truth about
magic and religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hoodwinking you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to know the real story,
what's going on with secret societies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who killed JFK?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the Wizard of Oz really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the Golden Road?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody interested in this book?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have one fiction collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about growing up in the late 60s
and what we went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to give to this guy because
he shared that book with that bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pada Luminati only has one rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe in no dogmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We invite all cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the most beautiful rainbow
spectrum of people sexualities,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it all to be a part of our
ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we invite everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's seven candles of the
rainbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's seven different magic
sigils on the candles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't hurt anybody,
you can do whatever you want in our
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we respect all the religions,
all the pagan religions, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: Freemasonry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use their ceremonies and rituals
because all these rituals of our ancestors
[SPEAKER_00]: resonate with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang on to the rituals and ditch the
dogma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see you next year with the Pada
Luminati.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be rocking this thing with
40,000 people on this hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're going to bring magic and
ceremony to Hempstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next year.
