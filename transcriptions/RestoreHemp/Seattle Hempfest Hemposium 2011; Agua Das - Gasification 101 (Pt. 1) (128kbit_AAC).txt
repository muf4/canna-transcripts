[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome to gasification 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1990, Don and I became the first people
pressing hemp seed oil in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States since 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: From all of what Jack was saying,
I thought lots of people were already
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned out we were pioneers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp is grown primarily for the
nutritious seed as is the flax seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I in the past considered flax a
competitor to hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the both of them have an incredibly
similar history.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy in the hemp herds is about
8,000 BTUs per pound on a moisture and
[SPEAKER_00]: ash-free basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gasification equipment does pyrolysis
followed by gasification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrolysis is where the plant material is
heated to turn it into charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about half of the energy is in the
solid charcoal at the end of pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other half is in the gases and the
tars that burn off in the making of the
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my gasification technology takes those
tars which would gum up an engine and
[SPEAKER_00]: turns them into a tar-free gas which can
be readily cleaned up and run an engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take the charcoal as a solid before
it's gasified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in the soil and it makes
biochar and wood will rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't do anything with wood or
hemp herds or plant materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil organisms will burn them into CO2
and water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as if we had used them and burned
them ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can do work with our
gasification fire that prevents the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: petroleum fossil fuels, we can have a
major benefit on the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the energy that's spewed out by
100 gallons of gasoline is one full ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 greenhouse gas is spewed out for each
100 gallons of gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know what your carbon
footprint is, look at it in terms of how
[SPEAKER_00]: many gallons you burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part of it.
