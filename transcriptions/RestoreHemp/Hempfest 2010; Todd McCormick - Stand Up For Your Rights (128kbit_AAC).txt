[SPEAKER_00]: I am extremely proud of our next speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is the editor of the new edition
of the Ampere Wears No Clothes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a presenting sponsor from THC Expo,
Hempire Expo, excuse me, Hempire Expo,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he also spent five years in prison for
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Peter McWilliams stage up
here, he was Peter McWilliams' partner,
[SPEAKER_00]: got busted working with Peter McWilliams,
and Rene Beauchet, who was in Canada for
[SPEAKER_00]: years escaping prosecution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a very good, dear friend of mine,
and one of the most hardest-working,
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent activists I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd McCormick, give a hand for Todd
McCormick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spent five years in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, thank you HempFest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want to say thank you very
much to Vivian, who started all this 19
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, and had the foresight to bring
us where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't know, if it wasn't for
what HempFest is, if we would even have
[SPEAKER_01]: the consciousness of hemp in the world
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, HempFest, I say give yourself a
round of applause, because you're leading
[SPEAKER_01]: the world right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did do five years in prison,
and like I just said to Vivian,
[SPEAKER_01]: after every HempFest, I would get hundreds
of letters from people, and it would blow
[SPEAKER_01]: me away that so many people cared,
not for me, but for some stranger that was
[SPEAKER_01]: representing something that they believed
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're really looking at, man,
is that we've got to support one another,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're the community and we're trying
to make the change, and the only way we
[SPEAKER_01]: can make the world a better place is if
we're nice to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when Vivian was just saying about
trash right now, you know, the answer is
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everybody packed up a little piece of
trash and threw it away when they got up,
[SPEAKER_01]: there would be none on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if we cleaned up the
problems of our ancestors, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that gave these drug wars to us,
like in 68, for a lot of us when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: born, I think it's time to end the
hypocrisy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to change the world,
and I think what we can do that by
[SPEAKER_01]: resisting all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Tim Leary used to say,
turn on, tune in, drop out, and I think he
[SPEAKER_01]: was only kind of right, because I think we
should turn on, tune in, but take over and
[SPEAKER_01]: change what we don't like, be the change
we want to see in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: When they came at me for growing
marijuana, my own medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: because when I was a little boy,
I had cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cancer 10 times as a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was nine, my mother thought I
was dying, so she started giving me
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana to use while I was going
through chemotherapy and radiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it profoundly changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it kind of drove me to the
activist that I am today, because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: always sought truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're all doing here today is a
representative of that truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're all trying to do is represent a
reality that's been stolen from us and
[SPEAKER_01]: hidden from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, as Vivian said, I'm now,
sadly, and I will say sadly, the editor of
[SPEAKER_01]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes, because Jack
was like a dad to me, and he taught me all
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff about activism, and I spent a
lot of time on the road with him,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that book had such a profound change
on my existence, because nothing else in
[SPEAKER_01]: my history, when I went to class and I was
in school, I thought this shit was so
[SPEAKER_01]: boring, it had no connection to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Jack showed me that cotton wasn't
the first fabric, and that paper was
[SPEAKER_01]: invented 5,000 years ago using hemp,
and that when Randolph Diesel made a
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel engine, he thought it would fit
into our eco system, that the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: would be able to plow the crops that made
the fuel that pushed the machine that
[SPEAKER_01]: plowed the crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only in the last hundred years have
these pharmaceutical companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: petrochemical companies come in and taken
away our natural alternatives to things
[SPEAKER_01]: like medicine and things like fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way we're going to change things
is if we twist this shit and we take the
[SPEAKER_01]: power back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it's ours, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: HempFest is really a representative of
this community, and this community could
[SPEAKER_01]: do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we got together and put our heads
together, we could end this drug war,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could end this hysteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: There used to be a time a hundred years
ago when you couldn't find hemp in every
[SPEAKER_01]: house, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, now you can't find it in any
house, because they've given us all these
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic solutions that don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way we're actually going to
do this is if we do it, break the law,
[SPEAKER_01]: commit civil disobedience, and if they
come at you saying, we're going to lock
[SPEAKER_01]: you up, say good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you locked up Gandhi,
you locked up Martin Luther King,
[SPEAKER_01]: you locked up Rosa Parks, and at the end
of the game you look stupid for doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to spend a few nights in a
prison cell reading books, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Break the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, stand up against it,
and when you're done with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: laugh and walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I got out of prison, I have helped
Marijuana Policy Project throw three
[SPEAKER_01]: parties at the Playboy Mansion for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had three sadly played very fair
plays, and you know, and our whole point
[SPEAKER_01]: of doing that is because we're trying to
get together all the artists and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: creative people, because we're not the
stupid stereotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not these morons that they want to
make us out to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're people that care,
we're people that are conscious,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're people that are enlightened,
we're people that are talented,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've got to break the stereotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to stop acting like they want us
to, which is to be scared, and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: complacent, and to do what you're told.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything I'm telling you from
Hempfest stage is now, stand up for your
[SPEAKER_01]: rights, pick up a little bit of trash to
show you care when you leave, and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you can to make the world a better
place, because one person can make the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference, and that person may be you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for coming to Hempfest,
thank you Vivian, thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother Todd McCormick.
