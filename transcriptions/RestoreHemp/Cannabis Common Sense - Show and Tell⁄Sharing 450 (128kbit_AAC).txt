[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing session tonight, our show and
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several of our museum items from
the Hemp and Cannabis Foundation's
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of about 200 different
medicinal cannabis items.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always bring out some things like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hemp food that you can pick up on
the internet or at health food stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are hulled hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hulled hemp seeds taste a lot like a
cross between cashews and walnuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you like, nuts, then I recommend
hulled hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them at health food stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next door, we find a cannabis
tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an alcohol extract from the 1890s
from the company Sharp and Dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp and Dome was in business up to the
70s, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right next door to that, we have two
different bottles, one from the 1890s,
[SPEAKER_00]: another one from 1910 that are from Eli
Lilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of these were different types of
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different numbers on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, this is tincture number 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tincture number 17, whatever that
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, next door we find from Mulfurt and
Company another cannabis tincture,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a really nifty thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a whole set of bottles with
cannabis tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Specific Medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a bottle of American Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even call it cannabis in this
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means the same thing, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp and cannabis, this is American Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you'd find in here are a bunch of
marijuana flowers, just like you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: buy some flowers in the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, which is like 1890 to
1920, you could buy these over the counter
[SPEAKER_00]: at your pharmacy, American Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wording on the side of these
bottles is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to go over that again someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a cannabis oil extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a recent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cannabis hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp seed oil is very nutritious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all the good fats that wipe out the
bad fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you press hemp seeds,
you get a third, 30% oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's left over is this stuff,
hemp flower, which is very high in protein
[SPEAKER_00]: and very healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the thing about hemp seed oil is it is
the most productive seed oil crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only is it healthy for you,
but it will run any diesel engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we could run our diesel engines
on hemp seed oil, then we would have such
[SPEAKER_00]: a supply of this hemp flower that it would
wipe out world hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to do that in the
next 20 or 30 years once we end adult
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, from the 1870s or 1880s,
we have a cannabis tincture bottle that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have found at an old apothecary
or drugstore way back when.
