[SPEAKER_01]: Joining us today on the program was one of
San Francisco's hardest-working activists,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis Perrone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis has been working in the gay
community, trying to change and make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference for the people there,
as well as working in the hemp community,
[SPEAKER_01]: and his political ideas and his political
efforts have made a change and an impact
[SPEAKER_01]: on that city that will last for its
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis, thank you for being on our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Casper, for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I was talking about
in regards to the change and changing of
[SPEAKER_01]: history in San Francisco is Proposition W.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people nationally are aware of it,
many aren't, but what you did with
[SPEAKER_01]: Proposition W is really a landmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition W and Proposition P aroused
out of a marijuana bust that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was busted in 1977.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to run the Big Top Pot supermarket,
and it was a one-stop pot supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a one-stop shop for all your pot
needs, and it was a very elaborate setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came to San Francisco, I had
trouble buying pot, and I had to kiss a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of ass, and I had a lot of hassles
getting pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just decided to start a pot
supermarket myself, or sell pot myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It evolved into a supermarket because
there were so many different kinds of pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at that time, and different prices and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to get as many different kinds
of pot together in one spot as I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea grew and grew and grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you knew it, I had three scales,
15 people working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had four people that all they did was
roll joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every night, we would sell pot to about
500, 600 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very elaborate setup,
beautiful house, and customers were
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with dignity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1977, I got busted, like I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a four-month trial after I got
busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mention that I got shot during
that raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it was is the supermarket was going
down, and I heard a ruckus at the door,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I went to the stairway to see what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this guy coming up with a gun,
big old floppy hat and fatigue jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first thing I think,
of course, is a rip, that these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to rob us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I do is grab something
close by, which was an empty El Hamber
[SPEAKER_00]: water bottle, and I hold it up the stairs
like, go down the stairs, and we'll forget
[SPEAKER_00]: all about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I even got the bottle up,
the guy had shot me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got me with the first shot and threw me
back, and then another shot went past my
[SPEAKER_00]: ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the point where I was convinced
that these guys were murderous rip-offs,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were going to kill everybody in
the house, so I was willing to give them
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I had, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy comes up the stairs and puts a gun
to my head, and I'm thinking that goodbye,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, another guy comes in the
room, and it turns out he's a cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out they're all cops, much to my
surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was shot, and I remember the day that
they were taking me out of the house on a
[SPEAKER_00]: stretcher, and out in front of the house,
there was five or six hundred people that
[SPEAKER_00]: had gathered around the house,
mainly my friends and customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they took me out, I shot a peace
sign to those people, and the whole street
[SPEAKER_00]: screamed, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis,
Dennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of support must have helped you
heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did help me feel a lot better,
even though I knew it was kind of curtains
[SPEAKER_00]: for the big top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an end of an era.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you brought forth
Proposition W.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's Proposition W exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition W, like I said, arose out of
the bust, and I knew that people in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco wanted marijuana legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that because we had a 1972
referendum on Proposition 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a statewide thing where San
Francisco voted 52 percent to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I and my friends went out and collected
16,000 signatures to put a referendum on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a local initiative, but it out and
out legalized marijuana for cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: sale, possession, anything you wanted to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted to take a bath in it,
you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, wasn't that contrary to federal?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's contrary to state and federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way I see it, San Francisco is
very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a city and a county.
[SPEAKER_00]: We elect our district attorney,
we elect our mayor, we elect our board of
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, these people are responsible
to us and also to state law, but to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that elected them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I directed at the chief of police
and the district attorney, seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: those two people were mainly involved in
marijuana prosecution and arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it won by 58 percent.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collected those signatures just before I
went into jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the big top hot supermarket bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was in jail, there was an
office open for charter commissioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends got the papers for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you knew it, I was a candidate
for office while I'm in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Proposition W was given a letter
of designation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a turnaround.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say most politicians wind up in
jail, but I started my political career in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd skip a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in November came around,
I got 20,000 votes and came 300 votes shy
[SPEAKER_00]: of winning the election.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition W got over 58 percent of the
vote to become technically the law of San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: The will, the spirit of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had allies in the political arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main ally was my good friend Harvey
Milk, the first case supervisor ever
[SPEAKER_00]: elected in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my other ally was George Moscone,
the liberal mayor of San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a friend of the gay community,
who was a friend of the potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just a friend of the weak
people and the people that had no voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that the assassination of Harvey
Milk really changed the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before I was to leave jail,
Harvey and George would be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killed by an ex-marine, an ex-cop,
an ex-fireman, an ex-supervisor who went
[SPEAKER_00]: on a Twinkie eating Coca-Cola laced
rampage and politically assassinated
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvey Milk and George Moscone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bullet that ripped through Harvey and
George's brain set the gay movement back
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everyone knew that this also set
the marijuana movement back 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we had this victory and the two
people that were going to see it enforced
[SPEAKER_00]: were now dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy that did it is claiming he ate
too many Twinkies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So needless to say, Proposition W got put
on the back burner and kind of forgotten,
[SPEAKER_00]: including by myself because like Harvey
was my friend and I couldn't even think
[SPEAKER_00]: about Proposition W.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I could think about was revenge,
revenge, revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvey is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: George is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to try to get back our power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we can never get those two men
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ran for Harvey's seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fortunately lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: In retrospect, it's fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Proposition W was quite forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not by me, but by the politicians and by
the police and by the district.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then over the years, you've made it a
point to bring a lot of awareness to
[SPEAKER_01]: people about the hemp movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, marijuana, we've always
had all the issues on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always had the truth on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've really found out 22 years,
truth is not enough and that in many ways
[SPEAKER_00]: people are brainwashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know that we can't rely on
people's brain anymore in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in a way we have to rely on the
only thing that seems to be left and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's their heart and their conscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, San Francisco is going through
a very serious AIDS crisis as America is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of sick people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of that pain arose Proposition P,
the medical marijuana initiative that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just put on the ballot this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that the success of that
has really rocked the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be talking about that as soon as
we come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking with activist and political
leader, Dennis Perrone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Dennis, you commented that this
particular proposition rose up out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: AIDS community and the pain and the
suffering that you saw for the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization for medical uses is what this
is all about, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me tell you something about how
it became into being.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was January 27, 1990, that we were
sitting home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about midnight and we were just
ready to go to bed when I hear a knock at
[SPEAKER_00]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going down to Answorth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get down there, a sledgehammer
breaks the door down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then come these five people who claim
they have a search warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My immediate reaction is that these guys
are rips because, number one, I'm not even
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim that they heard somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said that I had marijuana for
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that basis, they got a warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found marijuana in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found four ounces of marijuana in my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they also found was my very sick
best friend dying of AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, behavior that night reminded me
of what the Jews had to go through during
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nazi era.
[SPEAKER_00]: My very sick friend was thrown on the
ground with a gun to his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The son I raised was intimidated and
brutalized, thrown on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That night, we heard gay AIDS jokes,
gay jokes, we were physically and brutally
[SPEAKER_00]: intimidated by these thugs who found four
ounces of marijuana in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They arrested me for the four ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nine months later, I was exonerated
because the four ounces of marijuana were
[SPEAKER_00]: claimed by my very sick and dying friend,
Jonathan West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he died, he testified that the four
ounces of marijuana in the house were his
[SPEAKER_00]: and the charges were dropped against me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, he died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was he using these for this marijuana,
the hemp, for medical purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now we've heard on the show and
from other sources that it can be helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: in relieving pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be helpful in taking care of
nausea, helping with the ease of pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nausea, increasing appetite,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily why I did it, because marijuana
was keeping Jonathan alive for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: three years of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had no appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was 90 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana was literally keeping him alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was offsetting all the side effects of
the AZT and the chemotherapy and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: myriad of drugs he was taking,
legal drugs, that had severe side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: From depression to vomiting to diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you took this and you went out and
put together a proposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In memory of Jonathan West, his eulogy,
I collected 16,500 signatures to put
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana as medicine on the ballot in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never dreamed in my wildest dreams that
we would get 80% of the vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, that's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what does the wording pretty much
specify?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it strictly for medical purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how it's worded?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's strictly for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only for people that have certain
ailments that are covered under the
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does this mean that their doctors can
prescribe it or that if they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: caught with it and they have proof of a
certain ailment, then there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: prosecution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, legally, Proposition P has no
stature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is merely an advisory to the city and
county assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think the district attorney can
read numbers and I think that he knows
[SPEAKER_00]: that the people of San Francisco are
serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, we got more votes
than the district attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the highest vote getter in San
Francisco history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how many districts are there in San
Francisco?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 628 precincts in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 11 different districts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you brought in 30 of those precincts?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the gay districts, we had 30 precincts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 100% for Proposition P,
not one dissenting vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Proposition P seemed to have crossed
all the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that everyone thinks San Francisco
is cook city and in many ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is cook city.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of the people are totally cooky,
but 80% aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is a telling thing here
that we have crossed the cook boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone beyond cookdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we even got the elderly people to vote
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, I had elderly
people coming up to me and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis, you know, I used to use this stuff
when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother used to give me this for et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used it for rheumatism.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used it for bronchitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually had a tincture they put
on people's knees and joints for arthritis
[SPEAKER_00]: and rheumatism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we even got the old people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that people think, well,
older people are very against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older people are against drug use per se
and drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quite frankly, I'm against drug abuse
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are talking of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we haven't changed the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have given the people of San
Francisco a defense in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now is this defense good for
strictly residents of San Francisco or
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody from New York visiting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they know that they're not feeling
very healthy and they are looking for an
[SPEAKER_01]: avenue which they can relieve pain that to
show up in San Francisco as a tourist to
[SPEAKER_01]: take care of this problem or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it does seem to become that San
Francisco is going to become the lords of
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because after the election, I had gotten
phone calls from all over the nation from
[SPEAKER_00]: the people from multiple parts of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're anxious to come to San
Francisco because now they think they can
[SPEAKER_00]: get treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they also going to be able to grow
it, raise it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, Proposition P has no
legal stature.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is a political aspect to
San Francisco that makes it very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was during a mayor's race that
Proposition P was on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top two vote getters are now in a
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is Frank Jordan, an ex-police
chief who is trying to be a liberal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is the incumbent mayor who
is a liberal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have both been in contact with me
asking me how they can help enforce
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition P. I am playing that card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am playing each against each other for
the betterment of this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think you're going to be able
to get this to spread out now through not
[SPEAKER_01]: just the state, but do you think this will
start popping up now in New York,
Chicago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my new demands are six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six plants per AIDS patient, per cancer
patient, multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you got, six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to grow your own six
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm really asking for is de facto
legalization of marijuana, cultivation of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am asking the city or county of San
Francisco to look the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they see six plants growing in a
window, to just look the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I cannot change state law out of
San Francisco, although I do believe the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of California is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are taking this initiative on the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next targeted location is Santa Cruz,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, I want to take it to
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right into the belly of the beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do they protect themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're growing six plants,
so they have to have a statement from a
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor saying that they are AIDS patient
or cancer patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what we're advising
patients to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get an advisory note from their doctor
that says, if marijuana were legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because doctors cannot legally prescribe
it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that there will never be
another prosecution for marijuana in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that because I am going to stand
in the way of anybody that tries to
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecute anybody for marijuana in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition W.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the right time and the right place,
but Harvey dying and George dying screwed
[SPEAKER_00]: it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I intend to bring up Proposition W.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I put on before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with Proposition P. To try to make
San Francisco the place we wanted it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to let you know I've been aware of
your work in the movement for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've made quite an impact on many of
the activists coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're looked upon as one of the most
intellectual and hard-working leaders in
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an honor to have you on our
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have you back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've come with so much knowledge and
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you want me back, Casper,
it's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to have you realize that
anybody can get out there and join this
[SPEAKER_01]: fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The important thing is to get up and do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we have the opportunity to get
together the next time, keep strong,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep happy, keep wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
