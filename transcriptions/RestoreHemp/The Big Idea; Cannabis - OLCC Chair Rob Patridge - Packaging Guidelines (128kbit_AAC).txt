[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so Oregon's taken a pretty unique
approach compared to the other states that
[SPEAKER_00]: have approved, that have packaging of
labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon has taken a model more like
alcohol, and when, on every bottle of beer
[SPEAKER_00]: you have, and every wine, you know,
every bottle of wine, and every distilled
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit you drink, those labels all have to
be approved federally by the TTB in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, D.C., ahead of time,
before they can go out onto the shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: and before they can go out into the stream
of commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we noticed in other states was that
packaging and labeling were coming forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there'd have to be recalls,
or people would, the public would complain
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was attractive to children,
or, you know, they used cartoon characters
[SPEAKER_00]: of bright colors, or they did,
you know, or things were happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people were cutting the edge related
to what the packaging and labeling rules
[SPEAKER_00]: approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Oregon, we took a model more like
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Oregon, and if you have an interest
in this, you can go to marijuana.oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: .gov and look it up, but on labeling,
it's labeling guide and checklist,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a whole checklist there for
people who are practitioners, but what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do is we have a pre-approved label process
for our labeling and packaging in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we don't run into some of those same
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what the labels are,
we know what the packaging is,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're assigning every package and
labeling a unique ID number, so that into
[SPEAKER_00]: the future, you know, I would agree with
the congressman that things are moving
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are five states in the country right
now that are looking to approve
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana like Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are Massachusetts, Maine,
Nevada, Arizona, and the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's five measures on the ballot
this November.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're trying to do is, you know,
we know that our Oregon marketplace is
[SPEAKER_00]: very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the market for marijuana in
Oregon is about 520,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you take off, people who are,
you know, who are underage and you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider those people who, in all the
surveys, have said they're never gonna use
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, or they don't use alcohol
today, or they don't use tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to look at that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only about 520,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that at some point in time,
what probably is gonna happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, is that, you know, we're gonna
open up for retail legalization at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time, but Oregon has been a long
time exporter of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who, you know, Noel mentioned
it, I was the lead drug prosecutor in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jackson County 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the people I saw in the forum
when I was doing the marijuana thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had busted 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a great relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got along fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've tried to make our packaging and
labeling to the extent that we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog of what those packaging labels
are, that there's a unique identifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like when you go to the supermarket,
you have a unique barcode that gets done
[SPEAKER_00]: for that product that's sold across the
nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to establish that in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not developing, we don't have a
bunch of people downstairs trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide if this is child-proof or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've adopted federal child-proofing and
child-resistant packaging standards that
[SPEAKER_00]: have already been regulated at the federal
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're saying, you've got to go get
that federal certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we're doing that,
and it may be a little bit more expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: for people now, is we're trying to build
for a market that makes sure that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that we're thinking towards the
future in terms of what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've got objectivity, we've got
labeling, we've got packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got all those things in place to
make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we do have about 550 approved
packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got 240 or 46 approved
labels in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs $100 to submit a label or a
package for pre-approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty much caught up with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right on target with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would tell you was,
you know, we had this October 1st
[SPEAKER_00]: deadline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think September 5th, we only had like 50
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got this massive flood of
people at the last minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like Dave said, people are trying
to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not used to a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're new to bringing this product to
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been able to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to staff up and do those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some controversy related to,
you know, strains of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to get used to those things
that don't appeal to minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basically, I think out of a list
of, I don't know, 500 plus that the
[SPEAKER_00]: commission went through just initially on
popular strains, we have like 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than 20, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were some of those names that you
ended up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the names that we used were like
Girl Scout Cookies, you know, Grapevate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a cartoon show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've rejected those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only would they have, you know,
it's not our job to enforce copyright and
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have copyright and trademark
problems to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just don't want, you know,
we said use your common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk through your local toy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's something in there that has
the same label as marijuana, then don't
[SPEAKER_00]: call your strain of marijuana that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single one of those things was
like that, that we've rejected so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smurf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there's a trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just want people to use common
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, what we've told the
industry when we've gotten some pushback
[SPEAKER_00]: is, do you want the industry to mature or
do you not want it to mature?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it to mature, don't be
juvenile in the label choices you have
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not intended for juveniles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's intended for adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat it like an adult product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's been pretty
satisfying to most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We frankly haven't gotten much pushback in
terms of what we've rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of where we're going with
packaging labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you want the mechanics,
go to marijuana.oregon.gov.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's frankly the single portal site
in the state of Oregon to learn about what
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We launched that, I think, within 36 hours
of the election to try and make that the
[SPEAKER_00]: single portal site.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know what hearings we're
having, if you want to know any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things, log on to that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a listserv that you can log
on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get information about marijuana
and what the hearings are and what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of, you know, what your take in
marijuana may be, it's subjective and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just this is what government's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be involved, you know,
be involved in hearing about what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, we'd like you to be involved ahead of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've done a pretty good job
with our public involvement piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed when we had our hearings on
public involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd scheduled like four and a half hours
for hearings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were done in an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't have anybody sitting in the
queue waiting to testify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been doing public process for
20-plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that rarely ever happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exhaustive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you had an extensive array of meetings
all over the state.
We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was glad we weren't in the last
minute trying to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciated the congressmen who
participated with us and all these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: all have participated with us the whole
time to make it open to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: For public health people, for law
enforcement, for, you know, marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: advocates, for, you know, all kinds of
people to come to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
