[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a marijuana patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, who do we have in the marijuana patch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Herrer and Ed Adair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hi guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must be on the hemp tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you on the hemp tour, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on the hemp tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this is female, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hemp land.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going into hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into the hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're inside of the hemp now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're inside hemp, about 10 or 12 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, look.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this great background.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is natural, wild hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think you're going to succeed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can beat the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can anybody beat the truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This man and I have been out there telling
the truth, and nobody's ever said we're
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep arresting us 33 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have beaten us in jails.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have done physical things to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to describe on this air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's nothing that can beat a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't care how popular a president
thinks he is, when people realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: he's killed off a planet and he's killed
off the knowledge of a planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: then he's allowed millions of people to
die prematurely and in pain and in misery
[SPEAKER_00]: and has ruined the quality of life that
could be gotten with a good, simple
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine that never killed anybody except
at the hands of bad public policy and
[SPEAKER_00]: police carrying out bad public policy with
a vengeance.
Thank you.
