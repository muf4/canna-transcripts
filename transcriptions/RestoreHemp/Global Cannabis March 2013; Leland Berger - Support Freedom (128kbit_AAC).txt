[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to talk to you about two
things, and I want to ask you to do two
[SPEAKER_00]: things, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is that, you know,
I'm a proud member of the Normal Legal
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee, a national organization to
reform the marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our legal committee is about 450
lawyers nationally, and we look after
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that are charged with
cannabis-related offenses, and we do
[SPEAKER_00]: education and outreach and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lately, the leaders of Normal,
Alan St. Pierre, the executive director,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Keith Straub, the legal counsel,
have been making public statements that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't really what Normal's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan's been saying, for example,
that medical marijuana's a sham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal doesn't think medical marijuana's a
sham, but Alan says that publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith says, oh, five nanograms,
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's probably a reasonable
level for driving on the influence,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's not Normal's position at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal's been fighting hard to make sure
that there aren't, per se, driving on the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence laws passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'd like you to do,
the first thing I'm going to ask you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is I want you to write to Alan and Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's alan at normal.org, n-o-r-m-l.org,
and Keith at normal.org, n-o-r-m-l.org,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let them know that you heard me talk
about this, and ask them to knock it off,
[SPEAKER_00]: to quit saying stuff that's not normal,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do that for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, after years of playing defense,
we've been winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're moving bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also here on behalf of
Compassionate Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassionate Oregon is Anthony Taylor,
and the, gosh, what's her name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheryl Smith, the director of
Compassionate Center in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Anthony's been lobbying, not Anthony
Johnson, but Anthony Taylor's been
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying on behalf of Compassionate
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a bill to add PTSD past the Senate
19 to 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a hearing in the
health committee in the House on the 15th,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's going to pass the House.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the governor's going to sign it,
and then we're going to have PTSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: finally, as a condition that will qualify
patients in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught up with Russ Belleville about a
week after he stopped working with normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and said, what should we do, Russ?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the session, Russ said,
you know, it makes me crazy that in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, because this is before it was
legalized, sort of, and not sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but sort of legalized,
in Idaho and even Utah and California all
[SPEAKER_00]: have misdemeanor marijuana laws,
but in Oregon, if it's less than an ounce,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a violation, but more than an ounce,
it's a felony, and any amount of hashish
[SPEAKER_00]: or hash oil, or honey oil, or anything
that's derived from the plant is a felony
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what the quantity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Senate, I want to say 18 to 12,
passed a law that says if it's more than
[SPEAKER_00]: an ounce, but less than four ounces,
it's a misdemeanor, and if it's less than
[SPEAKER_00]: a quarter ounce of hashish or hash oil,
it's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to go to the House it's going
to pass the House, it's going to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor, and it's going to become the
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have misdemeanor marijuana
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another bill that the Oregon
Criminal Defense Lawyers Association has
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on that, you know, if you,
I don't know if you know, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people get these tickets for less than an
ounce and just pay the fine, and next
[SPEAKER_00]: thing they know, they get a letter in the
mail from the Department of Motor
[SPEAKER_00]: Vehicles, their license is suspended for
six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody know anybody that happened to
besides me and John Lucy and Paul Loney?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and no anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, trust me, that happens,
and it's wrong, and the Oregon Senate
[SPEAKER_00]: voted, I kid you not, 24 to six to make it
that the license suspension can't happen
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore for less than an ounce,
and that bill is going to go to the House,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to pass the House,
and it's going to get signed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor, it's going to become the law in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are through playing defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are moving laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we do is we show up and say,
you know what, it's going to be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either going to be legal this session
or next session or the next election cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: or the election cycle after that,
and we need to do things that create a
[SPEAKER_00]: glide path towards legalization,
and they're agreeing with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, you know, Anthony Taylor is
volunteering his time lobbying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been volunteering my time,
but, you know, Anthony lives out in
[SPEAKER_00]: McMinnville.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to drive down to Salem almost
daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I'm done talking, I'm going to walk
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my bicycle helmet here,
and the bicycle helmet has holes in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's because no change, brothers and
sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I need some folding money that we
can contribute to Compassionate Oregon to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the rest of these bills actually
become laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you, and God bless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
