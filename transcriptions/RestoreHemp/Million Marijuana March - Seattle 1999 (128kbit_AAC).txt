[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the Seattle Million
Marijuana March, which is put on by the
[SPEAKER_00]: folks with the Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to document the march,
which leaves from Seattle's Volunteer Park
[SPEAKER_00]: and heads over to Westlake Park over in
downtown Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like a crowd of about 300 people
here at the start of the march.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing, so that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're about four minutes away from
the start of the march.
Let's do it.
Save your voices for when we get to a
populated area.
Let's go!
Let's go!
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go!
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake up!
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
[SPEAKER_02]: There
[SPEAKER_03]: is a peaceful solution called a Peace
Revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a war and we're in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with love we can win it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dream so believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now get ready to receive it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the war is over and we've won it,
let's remember how we've done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Peace Revolution and a
Peaceful Revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Peaceful Solution saved America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Peaceful Solution saved America.
There
[SPEAKER_03]: is a Peaceful Solution, a Peaceful
Revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dream so believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now get ready to receive it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Peace Resolution and a
Peaceful Revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Peaceful Solution saved America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Peaceful Solution saved America.
We
[SPEAKER_01]: are here today as part of a global voice
that is screaming we will not be
[SPEAKER_01]: persecuted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not be scapegoated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not be demonized or imprisoned any
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a civil rights movement and it's
sweeping the world.
We're
[SPEAKER_01]: right to make our own educated and
informed choices on what we use for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and industry for spiritual
purposes and for recreation as adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: To our government we are saying we do not
need you in our living rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not need you in our grown rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't need you in our goddamn
bloodstreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more ocean of tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more cannabis amnesty now for all
prisoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're living in some wild times man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has ever lived in a time like this
in the history of humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are changing fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are times of major transmission for
human behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: This change is manifesting in so many ways
that it would be difficult to compute them
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: One can only guess what the result of this
gradual metamorphosis will be but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing that is certain to any
discerning person and that is as a people
[SPEAKER_01]: to have any kind of positive impact or
effect on creative or desirable future for
[SPEAKER_01]: the generations that surely will come
should a global calamity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to come together right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who will have the most
successful impact on the world will be
[SPEAKER_01]: those who follow principles and ideals
based on values that are morally and
[SPEAKER_01]: ethically right, that are sound and
self-evident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Policies of governments which condone acts
that are unlawful to the sovereignty and
[SPEAKER_01]: autonomy of the individual as a human
being should not be considered acceptable
[SPEAKER_01]: or tolerable by the citizens of those
governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: These include policies that strip rights
of free speech, choice of religion,
[SPEAKER_01]: racial and sexual equality and other
rights that do not interfere with or
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent the rights of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: America has declared war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: America's war is humanely unlawful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unacceptable human rights violations
across the board have resulted from the
[SPEAKER_01]: criminalization of otherwise decent
law-abiding citizens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Merely for possessing, using or selling
only those drugs which the established
[SPEAKER_01]: status quo hasn't had the opportunity to
cultivate some sort of financial monopoly
[SPEAKER_01]: on yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of money to be made from
the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: War on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not even possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only wage a war on people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the concept is logically flawed by
design.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stand here on the 50th anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have more people in jail in the
United States than any other country in
[SPEAKER_01]: the free world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them are in for
victimless nonviolent crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are first offenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previous to today, the very proclamation
of a drug war was absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: To have a war there must be two opposing
sides both taking some casualties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be more accurate to call the
previous years a drug massacre.
[SPEAKER_01]: By criminalization, people who choose to
recreationally use or sell or buy or
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacture substances not approved by the
government, we cannot defend ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: unless we risk arrest and incarceration,
the loss of our job and our home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has statistics on responsible
recreational users of substances because
[SPEAKER_01]: those people aren't creating any
recordable problem in their lives or in
[SPEAKER_01]: society.
[SPEAKER_01]: The emergency room does not receive the
folks while they're casually kicking back
[SPEAKER_01]: on their sofa driving the remote control.
[SPEAKER_01]: My admittedly radical leftist claim of
cultural genocide of sorts, I believe,
[SPEAKER_01]: is qualified by the gross discrimination
against and deliberate... I'll try.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deliberate scapegoating of people who use
illicit drugs, even marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: unarguably the mildest drug of all and by
most definitions, an herb, not a drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: an herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: One marijuana felony.
[SPEAKER_01]: One marijuana felony like throwing 100
plants or more will result in the loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: all welfare and other public aid,
student loans and Pell grants,
[SPEAKER_01]: public housing, GI Bill, also the forfeit
laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not forfeit laws, they're seizure
laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forfeit means you voluntarily gave it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: House, car, bank account, computers,
they'll wipe you out, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can result from one felony marijuana
arrest, mandatory minimum sentencing
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines prevent judges from stopping 20
to 30 year sentences for marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: offenses with no parole possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wraithers, pedophiles, murderers,
for some reason their crimes are not
[SPEAKER_01]: worthy of such punishment and in most
cases they get much less sentences
[SPEAKER_01]: according to our law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drug massacre is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with the vast network of very
sophisticated and dedicated activists,
[SPEAKER_01]: many of them family members of prisoners
or ex-prisoners themselves, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable foe to the phony, unwinnable
catchphrase war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a worldwide movement of
opposition based in humanitarian ethics
[SPEAKER_01]: and common sense, based in compassion and
seeking an all out total war as we are on
[SPEAKER_01]: addiction, poverty and abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we need to fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to fight.
We need to fight.
We need to fight.
We need to fight.
