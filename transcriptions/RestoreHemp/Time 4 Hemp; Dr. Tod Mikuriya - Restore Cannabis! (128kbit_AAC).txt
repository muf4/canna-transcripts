[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: On our program, we are blessed to have the
distinguished individual, Dr. Todd
[SPEAKER_01]: McCoria, come onto our show and share some
interesting viewpoints and some successes
[SPEAKER_01]: that they've had in the Bay Area and
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who are not acquainted
with this gentleman, he has a very
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive background.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a psychiatrist in private practice
in Oakland at Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a gentleman who introduced the first
methadone maintenance program in Alameda
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also a member of the California
Medical Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's certified by the American Society of
Addiction Medicine, and the California
[SPEAKER_01]: Society of Addiction Medicine is a
qualified medical review officer,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of blew that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also the co-author of a very
impressive landmark bill that has happened
[SPEAKER_01]: in San Francisco called Proposition P.
This man's background goes beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, that basically covers the
things that we're going to be approaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Proposition P, a lot of people have
become aware of that through the press and
[SPEAKER_01]: through media coverage, and I know people
becoming aware of your background
[SPEAKER_01]: recognizes that you have a lot going for
you intellectually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that when you make a comment that
we should pay attention to hemp as a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical resource for the curing of pain
and relieving of pain and other diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes with a lot of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems that we had,
well, we've been having problems for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years of getting access to medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once upon a time, I was in charge of
marijuana research for the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute of Mental Health in Chevy Chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back in 1967, but since that time,
there's been a minimal amount of progress
[SPEAKER_00]: in getting cannabis available for
medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only recently has there been some
compassionate access, and only recently
[SPEAKER_00]: have there been some grudging admissions
by the scientific and medical
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment that cannabis, in fact,
had therapeutic efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel very bitter about this because
I know it to be a cover-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since before marijuana was taken away from
availability by the 1937 Tax Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis also became
unavailable, deleted from the 1941
[SPEAKER_00]: formulary and pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why did that go hand in hand like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was part of this so-called send
them a signal school of propaganda and
[SPEAKER_00]: disinformation that the police had to
maintain in order to continue the
[SPEAKER_00]: fictionalized killer weed or part of
reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so saying that cannabis had medical or
medicinal utility would have run contrary
[SPEAKER_00]: to their fiction that they needed to
maintain in order to continue credibility
[SPEAKER_00]: and not having people question why
marijuana was, in fact, prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's the only plant substance drug,
which is not really a drug, it's a nerve,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been treated like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have opium that's still
available, et cetera, for medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes, et cetera, don't we,
and other forms of... That's right,
[SPEAKER_00]: even cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of the several factors,
the growing popularity and the promotion
[SPEAKER_00]: of synthetic drugs by the pharmaceutical
manufacturers that started in the 1890s
[SPEAKER_00]: and went on through the 1900s and has
escalated ever since with new and better
[SPEAKER_00]: allegedly synthetic substances,
no money could be made from any patents
[SPEAKER_00]: and they weren't interested in promoting
the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although Eli Lilly and Park Davis
maintained a farm for developing
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical strains and pharmaceutical
strength plants up until 1937.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're just now disregarding all
of that patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, and that's... Well,
it's very much like living, at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical world, with a depiction of the
planet of the apes and what happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine after they wanted to get rid of
all these human kinds of advances in
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and they reverted to some form
of medicine that resembled something that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in the Middle Ages or worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, now, see, people are able to
recognize that hemp can be made into
[SPEAKER_01]: paper, fiber, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to the idea of it being
medicine, outside of smoking it,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as relaxing, taking care of stress,
et cetera, it's hard for them to imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: in what areas hemp can actually be
utilized for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you say that it helps in AIDS,
as an example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay, back to this issue of
censorship and it's being swept under the
[SPEAKER_00]: rug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the importance of bringing this back
to consciousness and bringing it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the awareness of the medical community as
far as a therapeutic agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the text of the initiative
or the proposition in San Francisco that I
[SPEAKER_00]: coauthored contained the term restore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you take a moment and read it to our
audience?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommendation to amend the Health and
Safety Code of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the people of the city and county of
San Francisco recommend that the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California and the California Medical
Association restore hemp medical
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations to the list of available
medicines in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Licensed physicians shall not be penalized
for or restricted from prescribing hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations for medical purposes to any
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The term hemp medical preparations means
all products made from hemp, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: or marijuana in all forms that are
designed, intended, or used for human
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption for the treatment of any
disease, the relief of pain, or for any
[SPEAKER_00]: healing purpose, including the relief of
asthma, glaucoma, arthritis, anorexia,
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy,
nausea, stress, for use as an antibiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: and anti-medic or as any healing agent or
as an adjunct to any medical procedure for
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatment of cancer, HIV infection,
or any other medical procedure or herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a very broad definition of
medicine or medical or medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the definition of hemp medical
preparation is well documented in previous
[SPEAKER_00]: things like the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, in fact, all the definitions are
in place ready to go for medicinal use of
[SPEAKER_00]: crude cannabis products to be restored to
the formulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're in this wonderful
post-passage euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis Perrone, the spark plug behind
this, has appointed me the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinator for the Committee for
Compassionate Use, his organization,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get this on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we're trying to figure out
what do we do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden we've become successors
after all these many years having been
[SPEAKER_00]: failures and looked upon as outcasts,
deviants, nuts, irresponsible,
[SPEAKER_00]: dope-smoking hippies, and other kinds of
negative stereotypes that we've been stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with, which is all part of the suppression
campaign to keep cannabis, marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: or hemp illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, a lot of it has to do with people
of your stature being willing to come
[SPEAKER_01]: forth into the public light and make these
statements because, you know, you leave
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certain you realize that for a variety
of texts, whether it be from government
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies or private industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because it's really part of a
campaign to maintain these collective
[SPEAKER_00]: fictions in order to prop up these flawed
policies that they need to attempt to
[SPEAKER_00]: discredit or tarnish or kill the messenger
somehow, so as to not be made to confront
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual facts and deal on a level
playing field with what is in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back, I like to be able to go
a little bit farther as to how the next
[SPEAKER_01]: step, proposition P. Preparation P.
Preparation P helps take care of a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be implemented in the
direction that it's going to have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: before it becomes completely successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking today with Dr. Todd McCarea,
and we are learning some of the benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, from the medical uses of the
hemp plant, but now we also have some
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges against us still that we've got
to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have encumbered the first leg of the
journey, just the first battle,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it legal in a city,
but now I understand from talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis Perot and others, you still have to
encumber the state laws and the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do you plan on getting this into
the next phase?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already worked on attempting to surf
on this event wave and have taken a
[SPEAKER_00]: running start by contacting the California
Medical Association with regard to the
[SPEAKER_00]: possible passage of this before it
actually passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asking them to become involved with
helping to implement the intent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition which specifies that the
people of the city and county of San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco recommend that the state of
California and the California Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: Association restore hemp preparations,
etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think that will be met?
[SPEAKER_00]: With trepidation by the California Medical
Association, but it's been put on a fast
[SPEAKER_00]: track to be reviewed by their scientific
council.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with the president of the CMA,
Dr. Howard Lang, who impresses me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: forthright, courageous person,
but I don't know how he feels on the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was vaguely aware of having seen it
across his desk, but then passed it on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate staffers down at their
headquarters office in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were aware that it had passed,
but were not aware of how the California
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical Association was obliged to be
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't any kind of way we can force
the CMA to be involved in taking a stand,
[SPEAKER_00]: yay or nay, but if they do support this,
their options of activity are to publicize
[SPEAKER_00]: it amongst their physicians and also start
working in Sacramento for legislation to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this possible and, of course,
statewide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is there a chance that a federal
agent or a state agent would still take
[SPEAKER_01]: action in the city of San Francisco and
begin arresting people when they are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is always possible,
but we have this unique situation in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco where the district attorney has
assured us that he will not prosecute any
[SPEAKER_00]: cases for six plants or less that are
growing for medicinal purposes if the
[SPEAKER_00]: person demonstrates that they have
medicinal intent or documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gatewood Galbraith once made the comment
on a show of ours that if he were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: re-legalize Hampton, Kentucky,
all the tourists would come and he'd fill
[SPEAKER_01]: up all the hotels.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I spoke with Dennis Perrone,
he made comment that now that this has
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in the medical field,
a variety of organizations from
[SPEAKER_01]: musculoskeletal cirrhosis, etc.,
are wanting to open up foundations and
[SPEAKER_01]: offices, etc., in the San Francisco,
i.e., Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you foresee that happening,
and if so, is that going to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: movement stronger?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't thought of that eventuality
necessarily, but I would welcome that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would, with what we have in
mind, help everybody, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: sufferers that were in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now that we have the de facto
decriminalization, even though the state
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney general is a right-wing
individual that will probably oppose this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ironically, he was the opponent to the
DA who lost the race for the state
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney general to him, so there won't be
any love lost between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically, the state attorney general
could send state police and state
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics agents to go and do this kind of
enforcement, but it would be difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of his area of usual
responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see an attack like they had in
Humboldt County?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that in San Francisco,
where you have an uncooperative local DA
[SPEAKER_00]: with state laws, you have the mayor and
the public health establishment on your
[SPEAKER_00]: side, and as soon as we get back to San
Francisco, Dennis and I have a meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: with the head of the San Francisco Health
Department, that we will start moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and making something happen de
facto that would be politically suicidal
[SPEAKER_00]: to be punitive and to attempt to stop by
either federal or state intervention,
[SPEAKER_00]: that theoretically they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to target people who are
compassionately using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: this especially in an election year would
not look too good with regard to
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, the state of unreality inside
the beltway that doesn't really have any
[SPEAKER_00]: substantive health policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do something negative like this
would be, I would say, not good politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but back to trying to implement the intent
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be presenting to the
county health person a draft of a
[SPEAKER_00]: questionnaire in a form that we will have
distributed by the health department and
[SPEAKER_00]: publicized by them to the physicians in
San Francisco that we are starting a
[SPEAKER_00]: research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: To determine the impact of this in terms
of the first way of accurately assessing
[SPEAKER_00]: actual hazards and benefits of cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will involve visits by the users to
their family physician, or if they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have one, find one, because to get a
prescription for using cannabis they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have the signature of a
prescribing physician because it mandates
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're not going to be punished for
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then should the police come and
investigate a growing situation in a
[SPEAKER_00]: window box or something of that nature,
patio, that the person would furnish proof
[SPEAKER_00]: that this was for medicinal purposes and
they would be functionally sheltered and
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalized for their compassionate
access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a quid pro quo, we ask that they
give us certain facts with regard to the
[SPEAKER_00]: use for what ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have all these conditions listed
here and this will be part of the form
[SPEAKER_00]: that we will ask the patient to complete
and the physician also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know one thing that the taxpayers
from the Bay Area would be concerned about
[SPEAKER_01]: is when the Berlin Wall came down,
all the people came rushing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was an overflow into a new city
and not enough to take care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this wall comes bursting down in San
Francisco, you're going to have people
[SPEAKER_01]: from Miami, New York, everywhere coming
into San Francisco needing this medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: to relieve themselves from AIDS,
glaucoma, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's going to be an enormous
amount, it appears, people seeking your
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to prepare to take care
of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the San Francisco physicians can
respond to that challenge and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can provide them with good medicine and
also with frankness with regard to their
[SPEAKER_00]: substance use patterns and not have to be
hypocritical or fearful that anything will
[SPEAKER_00]: be happening to them so that they're not
going to turn down the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about people publicizing
to the medical community that this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and this is what the public
health department is doing to try to help
[SPEAKER_00]: implement it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we're going to ask for
is some office space in the public health
[SPEAKER_00]: department, but we'll pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're then going to start soliciting
contributions or money to implement this
[SPEAKER_00]: research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we're going to ask the
public health department to do is to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor the purity, quality, and strength
and do chemical analyses on hemp specimens
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be submitted by users because
they would like to know about different
[SPEAKER_00]: issues of purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, fungi and molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a critical issue for the
AIDS patients because those that have
[SPEAKER_00]: compromised immunologic systems and
problems with recurrent pneumonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have sources of mold or fungi come in
courtesy of the leaf would be not good for
[SPEAKER_00]: their health probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to study the level of
occurrences of these kinds of contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, fungi, possibly somebody might have
something in their soil they didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: about that would get into there like a
heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that essentially the health
department's laboratory would be
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting the health of the citizens of
San Francisco for drug purity with regard
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis plus providing us a source of
information for other phases of research
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be structure activity
relationships and variety, strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: other kinds of botanical or species,
kinds of differences or growth techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: will also start coming online with regard
to issues of what are good medicines,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are undesirable effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll start generating new research
and new approaches to problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A population which will give us this
information in exchange for being
[SPEAKER_00]: protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the kind of thing that I'm
quite excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we are sending the right
signal to the beltway back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to do so still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this kind of initiative
will help demystify because it will
[SPEAKER_00]: involve the medical community in learning
what is real and what is hysteria so that
[SPEAKER_00]: more legitimate information will come from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm asking to be appointed a principal
investigator for this research effort so
[SPEAKER_00]: as to coordinate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also enjoyed having you on our
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really have to go at this point,
but we'd like to have you come back soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time you get a chance to be on our
show, would you please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for tuning into our
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing what we can to bring in the
information to you as quickly as we come
[SPEAKER_01]: across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we're in touch again, keep happy,
keep strong, keep wide.
Thank you.
