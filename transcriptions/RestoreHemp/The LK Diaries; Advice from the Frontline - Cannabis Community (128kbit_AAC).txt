[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give up, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: This struggle is built on hope,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp is the hope for mankind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is a big form of a hope for the
future.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's not been a civil rights,
human rights movement that has made it
[SPEAKER_05]: this far in America that hasn't won not
long after.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really are making things happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my message would be, you know,
keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramp it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go in for the kill right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're making progress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go in for the heel.
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that nationally, the issue of
legalizing marijuana is at a tipping
[SPEAKER_24]: point.
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that it's going to happen in the
next several years.
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think everybody needs to redouble
their efforts on making this happen,
[SPEAKER_24]: on actually making it, pushing it over the
line.
[SPEAKER_24]: In spite of all the advances that have
been made, we're still today arresting as
[SPEAKER_24]: many people as we've ever arrested,
which is 1.8 million people a year.
[SPEAKER_24]: In this country.
[SPEAKER_24]: We have an incarceration rate in this
country among developed countries that is
[SPEAKER_24]: four times the per capita incarceration
rate of number two, which is New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_24]: And what's the definition of insanity?
[SPEAKER_24]: Doing the same thing over and over and
over again, expecting different results.
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's start looking at the other drugs
from a health standpoint rather than a
[SPEAKER_24]: criminal justice standpoint.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say come together, come together
right now and free the weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a remix.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a remix.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I always say, you know, everybody got
to be more educated, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: go out there, speak your mind,
you know, people that don't know,
[SPEAKER_12]: let them know, you know, not everybody
knows exactly what we're going,
[SPEAKER_12]: what's going on right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_12]: People think we're coming together just to
smoke and you know, yeah, we're here to
[SPEAKER_12]: have a good time, but we're here to
educate also, you know, to let you know
[SPEAKER_12]: that what hemp can do for us, what medical
marijuana can do for their patients and
[SPEAKER_12]: also, you know, just go ahead.
[SPEAKER_12]: I go out there, free your mind,
open it up and let people know and
[SPEAKER_12]: educate, you know, educate yourself and
others, you know, cause like I said,
[SPEAKER_12]: other people don't know what we're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So some people literally like,
I know you think, Oh, everybody knows
[SPEAKER_08]: about hemp and marijuana or medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to tell you, no, they don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've traveled to Chicago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I traveled to New York, South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I show them footage of stuff with
that we do that we come perform and do for
[SPEAKER_08]: the cause, they absolutely freak out.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no police around.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not being arrested.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's crazy, but a lot of people
aren't educated and we want to educate the
[SPEAKER_08]: people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the, I didn't believe it or not,
I didn't graduate from high school and
[SPEAKER_08]: look, I still learn every day of my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every day I learned something every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I could grab that little bit stuff
that I learned and tell somebody else
[SPEAKER_08]: about it, that's how we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how I say it, you know,
with our music, we can serve the masses
[SPEAKER_08]: and like they say, no matter what it
doesn't, it just never ceases to,
[SPEAKER_08]: how do you call it, to come together and
always say that the children are our
[SPEAKER_08]: future.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I want to, I'm not talking
about like real babies.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you feel me, teenagers that are
coming up, starting to experiment and
[SPEAKER_08]: educate them and let them know about hemp
and how hemp can really save the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: May Jack care, rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arm yourself with every ounce of knowledge
that you could possibly retain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, go forward facing, I hate to say
the word enemy because really they're only
[SPEAKER_04]: an enemy if they truly know what's right
and do the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but educate your friends,
educate your foe and in return the world
[SPEAKER_04]: will follow.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that it has the, it's not just
about helping patients.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not just about helping people who
have sicknesses.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's about, it's also putting,
you know, it could put farmers back on
[SPEAKER_22]: their land.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's a, there's so many
reasons that it should be legal that I
[SPEAKER_22]: don't know where to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get active, you know, participate in any
way that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some skills you have,
you can bring to this movement one way or
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to have, you know,
a high school education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring whatever skills you have to the
table and put them forward to move this
[SPEAKER_00]: movement forward because it's the only way
we're going to get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even growing, even cultivation,
that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a political act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as good as standing on the stage
and speaking from the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it from the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it with the motivation of greed
and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it with the motivation of creating
better medicine, better cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and stick to variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get bogged down in one strain,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explore and enhance your life with the
beauty of all of the different experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can get from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: As it becomes, people become aware of the
fact that reefer madness was just a bunch
[SPEAKER_13]: of crap and it's an extremely useful drug
and it's been medically documented that
[SPEAKER_13]: it's good for about 200 different medical
conditions other than the first nine or so
[SPEAKER_13]: that were, what shall I say, make patients
eligible in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have heard from many people,
Dr. You have saved my life, and I think
[SPEAKER_13]: one of my poster boy patients was a marine
helicopter pilot in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was shot down seven times.
[SPEAKER_13]: The last time he was in the hospital,
31 months getting taken care of,
[SPEAKER_13]: and he was on something like 400
milligrams of morphine a day, which is
[SPEAKER_13]: enough to stop an elephant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the VA would not let him use
marijuana, so he told him to go fly a
[SPEAKER_13]: kite, and he came to me and he told me
several times, Dr. You saved my life.
[SPEAKER_13]: He was able to drop the morphine down to
60 milligrams a day because he was not
[SPEAKER_13]: able to use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think medical marijuana's time has come,
but we always have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's always pushback and we have to be
ready for it and we have to be prepared,
[SPEAKER_15]: know what we want to say, know what we
want to convey to the general public so
[SPEAKER_15]: they're not afraid of us or what we're up
to.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really think we've got more Americans
who have smoked marijuana than who have
[SPEAKER_11]: not.
[SPEAKER_11]: We show a majority of the Americans now
favor the idea that we shouldn't treat
[SPEAKER_11]: smokers like criminals, so I think we're
awfully close to a tipping point.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may come in November if California
passes that initiative to legalize and
[SPEAKER_11]: regulate and tax marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is truly the beginning of the end
because other states will follow very
[SPEAKER_11]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out there and put these efforts into
hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same energy and effort that was put
into medical marijuana by the marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: people, THC people, I think that same
energy should be put into hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think by putting that energy into hemp,
it's more consistent because when we go
[SPEAKER_03]: for the medical marijuana, that's just for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we go for the hemp, we're now
repaying the earth because it's for the
[SPEAKER_03]: earth as well as for us because it's
healthy for the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've used medical marijuana and wanted it
because it's healthy for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the same thing applies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp is healthy for the earth,
so I would like to see the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana put some of the same intensity
and energy into now getting medicine for
[SPEAKER_03]: the earth that was used to get it for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to see hemp around the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it could be solving a lot of
the world's problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, a lot of people think that this or
that have opinions about it, but what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're suggesting is go check out the facts
about what can really be done with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean from food to clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check out the facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what can really be done with it
because we've got to take it from being
[SPEAKER_03]: just an abstraction hemp as an add-on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking about global warming,
climate change, all of these things we're
[SPEAKER_03]: discussing and talking about, hemp has a
tremendous impact on being able to help to
[SPEAKER_03]: balance what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're asking people to research,
check it out, and if they're in agreement,
[SPEAKER_03]: to act on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're not in agreement, well,
then they're not in agreement.
[SPEAKER_17]: Be yourself and take some time for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here for the weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I always like to say.
[SPEAKER_17]: Do some things to support it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Talk to people about it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Be an activist about it, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Go to city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_17]: Support your homies.
[SPEAKER_17]: Show up at court when somebody's got a
court date.
[SPEAKER_17]: Read West Coast Cannabis Magazine,
westcoastcannabis.com, and hang out and do
[SPEAKER_17]: your best.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're reaching the tipping point.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if everybody can do a little more,
what's the old phrase?
[SPEAKER_17]: No one can do everything, but everybody
can do something.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if everybody could do just a little bit
more, take an extra 15 minutes per day to
[SPEAKER_17]: pump it up, pow!
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could say one thing to the
marijuana community, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_10]: Get active.
[SPEAKER_10]: Short, but to the point.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to add, guys, let's write the
president.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's follow the lead of this man and make
sure that all of our warriors come home,
[SPEAKER_10]: because it's an unjust war.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_18]: My advice to the marijuana community is
get together.
[SPEAKER_18]: Support the legalization of both hemp and
cannabis as one thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that there's a lot of like,
OK, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's good for this.
[SPEAKER_18]: And hemp is good for this.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the fact that there's any plant that
is that useful that is considered illegal
[SPEAKER_18]: by any government is criminal.
[SPEAKER_18]: And so wake up, people.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got to do it.
[SPEAKER_18]: No one's going to do it for us.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what I got to say.
[SPEAKER_19]: You really have to stand up and do what's
right.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really want to thank, from the
bottom of my heart, those activists that
[SPEAKER_19]: go beyond the call of duty, because we're
pretty much all volunteers and the folks
[SPEAKER_19]: that take the time to come to these events
and to sing to the choir and to teach the
[SPEAKER_19]: choir that they need to raise their voices
and be heard.
[SPEAKER_19]: The activists that come out here are my
heroes.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we don't stand up for what's right,
no one's going to stand up for us.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have to do this.
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to stand up for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you really need to just do what's
right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Help someone that's sick.
[SPEAKER_19]: This movement is going in a very fast pace
right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want the folks to forget about the
patients.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't forget about us.
[SPEAKER_14]: We spend too much time talking to each
other.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're selling to the convinced.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an element of our society that is
the most powerful voting block.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the seniors.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're my generation.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're smokers.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they've been underground so long.
[SPEAKER_14]: They generally don't work for activism.
[SPEAKER_14]: In South Florida, where I live,
they have no conception of what's being
[SPEAKER_14]: done with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the petition we're trying to
pass.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I get home, I'm starting a silver
tour.
[SPEAKER_14]: I will go to the clubhouses at these
hundreds of senior communities.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a great PowerPoint show.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got videos.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm taking a doctor or a nurse to each
one to answer legitimate medical
[SPEAKER_14]: questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: These people all vote.
[SPEAKER_14]: They all have their congressman's phone
number.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're not afraid to call.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it should go viral because if they
live in Golden Gates, they go to Golden
[SPEAKER_14]: Age to play cards.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they go over there to Senior Village
to play bingo.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they need something to talk about.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you talk to them about marijuana
and Alzheimer's, marijuana and cancer,
[SPEAKER_14]: marijuana and MS, they have no clue.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're going to have.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, Mark's mission to plant the
seeds of freedom and overgrow the
[SPEAKER_21]: government has taken place.
[SPEAKER_21]: The roots are growing in the ground.
[SPEAKER_21]: The plant is flourishing.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're seeing things happen.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it is possible.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so you never give up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Even though I myself am guilty of
sometimes giving in to despair and feeling
[SPEAKER_21]: like, you know, it's impossible to stop
this.
[SPEAKER_21]: It keeps getting worse.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's more prisons being built and all
of the horrible things that happen.
[SPEAKER_21]: Despite that, there's so much progress
being made.
[SPEAKER_21]: And even if we don't see legalization in
our lifetime, we have to lay the
[SPEAKER_21]: groundwork for our children and their
children and for the future, because we
[SPEAKER_21]: have to do that.
[SPEAKER_21]: If we don't, we're guilty of allowing this
horrible drug war to continue.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always ask everybody this one question,
sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could say anything to the marijuana
community, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to tell them all the time,
do not smoke in the rain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And many of them when asked me,
why not?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, well, because of the rain.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he signed he signed four of my
cards, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he made me raise my hand and swear
that I would not smoke in front of the
[SPEAKER_10]: police or underwater.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't do either of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Lavek, I just want to thank you for
being a great American.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being here, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we all live under the same
constitution and the same democracy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we don't use our free speech,
then we don't deserve to have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people died for our right to speak out
against our government when it was when it
[SPEAKER_05]: when it could make things better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's happened before Americans had to
change laws to make America a freer place.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're saying do it one more time.
[SPEAKER_05]: These cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know that in Seattle, the sky
didn't fall.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to have that amount of people there
and everybody getting along like they did,
[SPEAKER_10]: it speaks volumes for for the marijuana
movement.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so pleased to be a part of it every
year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for letting me be a part of
it every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: But our government can only be as
effective as the people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so voting is very important and people
might say, my vote doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the vote that's never cast never is
counted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's so it's important to vote.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to be involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not involved, you're part of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_16]: If I had to say one thing, it just have to
be the educate.
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody needs to be educated on the
marijuana is just a plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's educate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to legalize this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to end prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is ridiculous that it's been on this
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to make a stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could save this country by legalizing
hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's not only good for our our
health and safety, it's good because it
[SPEAKER_20]: creates jobs.
[SPEAKER_20]: And by legalizing hemp, in particular,
we create a whole industry because hemp is
[SPEAKER_20]: really a gold mine of resources.
[SPEAKER_20]: And as a doctor and as a nutrition wonk,
you know, I can testify that there are
[SPEAKER_20]: incredible nutritional values to hemp.
[SPEAKER_20]: There are a whole set of fatty acids that
are really critical for our health that
[SPEAKER_20]: are not otherwise widely available.
[SPEAKER_20]: So there are very important nutritional
and food values to hemp, as well as
[SPEAKER_20]: potential as fuel.
[SPEAKER_20]: Its value agriculturally is especially
important in this day and age of climate
change.
[SPEAKER_23]: I would speak to the women in the
marijuana community.
[SPEAKER_23]: And I would say to you, my sisters,
it's time for us to stand up.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's time for us to protect our children.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's time for us to grow our jobs and earn
a sustainable wage.
[SPEAKER_23]: Please, please talk to your sisters,
talk to your moms, talk to your aunts,
[SPEAKER_23]: talk to your babysitters and let's end
cannabis prohibition and the fear and the
[SPEAKER_23]: tyranny and vote yes on Measure 80 in
November.
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say walk.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would I say?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say keep going.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say don't make a fool of yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say don't don't, you know,
don't be confrontational, but keep going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't let people shut you up.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, don't let people put you down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't let people tell you how stupid you
are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any of those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep going because it's a totally sensible
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, when it was decriminalized,
so to speak, here in Oregon, did the
[SPEAKER_07]: murder rate go up?
No.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, actually, a violent crime
actually came down.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I'd like to say, which people
talk about a lot, and I've said this
[SPEAKER_07]: before, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm not an advocate of any
particular use of anything, but cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: is it's it's an unlocking agent,
among other things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And can I be blunt?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, the first time I took acid,
OK, way back when the funny because acid
[SPEAKER_07]: makes you laugh.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, it doesn't allow you to.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes you laugh.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, you will laugh.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing that is the most funny that
I remember is pomposity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pomposity is the funniest thing on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you learn to laugh at pomposity,
the game is almost up, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: because they can tell you what to do and
what to think and where to sit down and
[SPEAKER_07]: when to shut up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everything else with their big
uniforms and their badge and their
[SPEAKER_07]: pompousness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you start to laugh.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all I'm saying is that some of these
things are unlockers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They unlock your creativity.
[SPEAKER_07]: They unlock your sense of humor and they
allow you to see the ludicrousness of
[SPEAKER_07]: certain kinds of superiority.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I don't know how to fix guitars,
so I bow to the authority in that sense of
[SPEAKER_07]: the word of a guitar repairman when mine
gets broken.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only definition of authority
that I give any any credence to the other
[SPEAKER_07]: one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not an authority.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've just got a gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put me away for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not authority.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's force.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can get things square and
straight with our terminology and we can
[SPEAKER_07]: learn to laugh at the right time and we
can understand that unlocking our brains
[SPEAKER_07]: can be dangerous to some other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we understand why they don't like us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just keep going.
[SPEAKER_07]: We allow people to slowly but surely
understand that we're not in danger.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not endangering them.
[SPEAKER_07]: The murder rate isn't going to go up.
[SPEAKER_07]: The world isn't going to fall apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: The earth isn't going to hit with
asteroids.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dinosaurs aren't going to come back
all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to go on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we might even get some
constructive things done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to think for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look into the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to the lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're getting in all
mainstream media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really think for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, you know, get in there and
study it and you find out what the truth
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to look for it to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are a good place to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hemp stock here in Portland,
Seattle Hemp Fest, these type of events,
[SPEAKER_02]: normal in San Francisco, the convention
