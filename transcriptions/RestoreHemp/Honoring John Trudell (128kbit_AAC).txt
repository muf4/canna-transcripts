[SPEAKER_03]: We're glad that Mr. Robertson from the
Vice President's office thinks that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have proved our point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's to us when we know we've proved our
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've proved the point that Mr.
Robertson would like to have proved,
[SPEAKER_03]: but about the things that are going on
about Indian peoples socially and
[SPEAKER_03]: economically being below par compared to
the rest of the population.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got a bigger point than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're saying we're talking about law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about respect as a people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Respecting a people as a people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about more than poverty.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're saying you've never dealt with us
honorably, United States, ever,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's time that you start doing so
because we're not going to allow it to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Robertson's point was that all the
problems for the Indian people,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as you just mentioned, are in the
cities on the mainland, and therefore you
[SPEAKER_01]: were not helping these problems by staying
out on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Problems for the Indian people are within
the United States government.
[SPEAKER_03]: Problems that we're having is the
Nisqually fishing battle at Frank's
[SPEAKER_03]: Landing in Washington, where the treaty is
being broken.
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal government is allowing the
state government to break a treaty that
[SPEAKER_03]: was signed between the Indians and the
Indian people and the federal government,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that treaty is a law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about things like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about that if we're free,
we want the right to make our own
[SPEAKER_03]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want the great white father image
anymore looking down on us, making the
[SPEAKER_03]: decision for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Robertson or President Nixon came out
with this proposal that he gave to
[SPEAKER_03]: Congress, the nine-step plan, and he talks
in there about ending paternalism.
[SPEAKER_03]: He created that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't end any paternalism with that
bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Mr. Toodle, President Nixon says
that he feels particularly close to
[SPEAKER_01]: Indians because his football coach,
who was also his first campaign manager,
[SPEAKER_01]: is an Indian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think he is particularly close to
the Indians?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mr. Nixon's probably particularly
close to Mr. Nixon, and we're concerned
[SPEAKER_03]: about people, the reservation people,
the people on the reservations that are
[SPEAKER_03]: being forced to assimilate or die out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're worried about things like our
language and our culture, and we want this
[SPEAKER_03]: on our own terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to be able to hang on to it
because the federal government says we can
[SPEAKER_03]: keep this much and we can keep that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of us, and we want it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what we're accomplishing by here is
Alcatraz never sold out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The government offered us money for the
island, which went through these current
[SPEAKER_04]: negotiations starting April the 13th.
[SPEAKER_04]: They offered us money, and we told them
no.
[SPEAKER_04]: They offered us a lease.
[SPEAKER_04]: We told them no.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, we want to talk about when you're
going to turn the deed over to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: The significant thing that's been
accomplished by Alcatraz is whether we
[SPEAKER_04]: want the physical part of the island or
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We never sold ourselves out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We never compromised.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went for the whole cupcake,
and if we don't get it, we're bringing
[SPEAKER_04]: people to our side.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of Indians that aren't going
to like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Defeat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no such thing as defeat.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they start kicking you around,
you just got to learn to bandage up the
[SPEAKER_04]: bruises so you can stand up again.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't beat us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the deal is, I think the one
important thing that comes out of this is
[SPEAKER_04]: that the government gave us their word
through their negotiators that nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: would happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came out there and they took our
people off the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all this is going to narrow down for
our own Indian people.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to benefit Indian people
throughout the country, because here's the
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Indians know whose side the
government's on.
[SPEAKER_04]: The government don't lie to you and go out
there and do something against you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to see like, all right,
every day you got to do a little something
[SPEAKER_04]: to get a little people on your side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've got Indian people that know,
they've got their questions or dislikes
[SPEAKER_04]: against the government, but when they see
the government come out and commit actions
[SPEAKER_04]: like this against us, the government is
talking about honor and Vietnam and it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes out here and lies to Indians just
because we're Indians.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean they lie to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of had to find us a new place to
live.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we figured this would be as good a spot
as any.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a military base.
[SPEAKER_04]: Belongs to federal government,
they say.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're here.
We've.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pretty, to put it mildly,
we're pretty upset about the way the
[SPEAKER_04]: government handled the Alcatraz situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you expect that people will come here
and will live and you attempt to make it a
[SPEAKER_00]: community, or is it a gesture of defiance
of the government?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're both the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like when you get Indian people
together now and we just want to live,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's defying to the government already.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, what we want is like really,
it just boils down to basically we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: be left alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be left alone, but we want the
right to guide our own lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't believe in the Great White
Father.
[SPEAKER_04]: We think that it's a myth.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude's dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never existed.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't agree with the federal
government's chain of thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: or if you don't agree with what they tell
you, you should agree with, then they
[SPEAKER_04]: react against it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They react against it very harshly.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the way they bring it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bring in all these armed people to
Alcatraz and they knew we were unarmed out
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did it at People's Park or Isla
Vista.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people stand up for their rights,
they have a tendency to react,
[SPEAKER_04]: to show you their strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they show you their strength,
they're always showing you how many guns
[SPEAKER_04]: they've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it this way, if criminals are supposed
to be in jail, you guys can take that for
[SPEAKER_04]: what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever put the names, they're amended.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more than one kind of criminal,
more than a street criminal.
[SPEAKER_04]: A street criminal just reacts to what the
other criminals create for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of some trouble over some copper
wire, they had an excuse to get you off
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcatraz.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of excuse will they have to move
you from here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they'll have any excuses to
move us from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as their copper wire excuse
that we were stealing, that's a whole long
[SPEAKER_04]: story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one is that they knew that we were
taking the copper from the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've known that for over a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: How come all of a sudden they're all
panicky about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the vandalism that we did to the
island, you know, supposedly did,
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're charging us with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, let's think back about 400
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the Europeans came over here,
they came over here and they discovered
[SPEAKER_04]: this main body of land here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the process of discovering,
they tapped the land and they took the
[SPEAKER_04]: natural resources for their own use.
[SPEAKER_04]: They committed vandalist acts against the
land because look at the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's vandalism.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on Alcatraz, we've done the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, we did it on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we tapped the natural resources,
which happened to be copper that had
[SPEAKER_04]: islands, natural resources for the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We discovered the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were claiming it for our own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took it for our own use.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so if we're crooks for stealing
that copper, then who's crooks for
[SPEAKER_04]: stealing this over here?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it just, so if they're going to
go like that, we're both crooks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to what degree, who's the biggest
crook of all?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think everybody's feeling about
the temporariness of their situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that bothering people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it bothering you?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't bother me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it bothers anyone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alcatraz was 19 months of temporariness.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're used to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in a way, Indian lives now,
the whole Indian way of life has been
[SPEAKER_04]: built on temporariness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boarding school system, you're temporarily
there, you're temporarily at home,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're temporarily in the joints,
you're temporarily on the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always temporarily somewhere and
permanently nowhere ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Permanently just having to hassle,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing we have that's permanent is
our reservation land.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're always in a temporary situation
on our own land.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being so disorganized with no furniture
isn't putting anybody uptight?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like last night at midnight,
the place was completely quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were used to it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come in yesterday morning at 4 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: By 8 o'clock last night, everyone had
houses and just drifted right into living,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You live like that, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You live when you can, but it's no big
hassle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nothing that exciting, you know,
just for us, it's just a way of life,
[SPEAKER_04]: just doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not getting tired?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long year for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's start to get tired and then the
government comes out there and they get
[SPEAKER_04]: cute and then that just kind of takes the
tiredness and just washes it away,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, because the government's there
and they do what they do, so it isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: enough time to really get tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something to keep you going.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we would be more tired if we just
had to lay around and not be able to do
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing at all, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had your choice of what the
outcome, what would be your most
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasurable outcome?
[SPEAKER_04]: Get an honorable government.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then you've got an honorable
government, then you don't have to worry
[SPEAKER_04]: about these other assholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, honorable people will sit down
and talk and try and work out a solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, government people out there now what
do you expect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before they came, like 400 years of prison
was pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure it was, you know, it's 400 years of
prison, like the islands always been
[SPEAKER_04]: misused.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the only time that islands had
any liberation is when we were out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides what all this propaganda that the
government is running down about how we,
[SPEAKER_04]: how filthy we were and what kind of
vandals we were, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had that island liberated, people were
free to move around out there and all of a
[SPEAKER_04]: sudden reporters, even reporters since
that time, when they went out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: they never talked about bad vibes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact exists that we held Alcatraz for
19 months against the United States
[SPEAKER_04]: government.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did it on our own, we did it our own
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were never co-opted.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to offer us money.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, we don't want your money.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to offer us a lease.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, we don't want your leases.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want this for our own, for us to build
it and make it, either make it last or
[SPEAKER_04]: fall, but we want it to do it on our own.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already know that we're equal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're equal as human beings,
so we're not fighting for equality.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're fighting for is we want
economic opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want the right to control our own
economic base, you know, and we want the
[SPEAKER_04]: right to control our lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was worth it in the sense here of like
there are more Indians now that have
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten out of being apathetic and they did
that because of things like Alcatraz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alcatraz happened, after Alcatraz
happened, Fort Lawton happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Black Hills movement happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happening on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a revival of Alcatraz.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're building Indian pride.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud to be an Indian, and I'm going
to stand up to the United States
[SPEAKER_04]: government to prove it.
Thank you.
