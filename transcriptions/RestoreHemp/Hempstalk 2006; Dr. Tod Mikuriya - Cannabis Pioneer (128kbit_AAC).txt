[SPEAKER_00]: 1959, many years ago, I was a sophomore in
medical school and I was smitten by an
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate stroke of curiosity when I
read a selection in a textbook called
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodman and Gilman about cannabis,
which whetted my curiosity because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited, but medically, it sounded as
if it was pretty benign.
[SPEAKER_00]: This curiosity led me to read everything
in the medical school library and then
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually permitted me to infiltrate to
the heart of the beast, the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute of Mental Health, where I was
hired as a research psychiatrist to study
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, cannabis was seen as a real
threat to society because in 1967 when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was there, all hell was breaking loose
with Lyndon B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnson trying to keep up the pretext of
patriotism as he moved forward on the war
[SPEAKER_00]: in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anti-war demonstrations were just
tremendous in scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish we would see these kinds of
protests again, but marijuana was seen as
[SPEAKER_00]: something dangerous that was being adopted
by subversive organizations like
[SPEAKER_00]: California communes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw the end of civilization coming
near because the legal governance was
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down as they sent more and more
young men off to be killed in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I came out to California
and ended up defecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There I fled and did my practice of
psychiatry until things started happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened starting in the Haight-Ashbury
and in the Castro in the response to the
[SPEAKER_00]: AIDS epidemic, where different kinds of
effective medicines were unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was discovered was cannabis would
prevent nausea and vomiting and permit the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of different kinds of medicines for
treating AIDS and the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this snowballed and what started in
the Castro was taken under the wing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: political pros and we went statewide and
we passed proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years later, same kind of thing passed
up here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, I've had opportunities to
evaluate over 11,000 patients for their
[SPEAKER_00]: use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what has impressed me is cannabis is
both safe, effective, and a viable
[SPEAKER_00]: substitute for many medications used to
manage chronic illness that's far safer
[SPEAKER_00]: and free from adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the forces of evil,
namely the greed of the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies coupled with the criminal
justice sore head losers don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: admit this to be a medicine and will do
everything they can to suppress it.
