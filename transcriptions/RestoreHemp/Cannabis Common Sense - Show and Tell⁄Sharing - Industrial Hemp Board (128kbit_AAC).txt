[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the original pieces of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is medium-density fiberboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was made out of hemp that was grown in
Spain, imported through France.
[SPEAKER_00]: We imported this, I think, in 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: We imported a bale through CNS Specialty
Builders Supply, Bill Condy, David Sieber,
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the board of directors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to discover what we could do to use
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had this bale of hemp that we
had to bring in through the DEA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had to prove that there was no THC
in it whatsoever, and we were able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we got the hemp, and now we have to
discover what is it that you do with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bale of hemp to turn it into an actual,
real-life board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States study said that that is
stronger than steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we did when we had to
actually go through all of the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: industry tests for this, for this board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we discovered was that it met or
surpassed every standard in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the modulus of rupture on this is
something like 1,500, which is 10 times
[SPEAKER_00]: average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we had it tested on CNN,
because we actually did have this tested
[SPEAKER_00]: on CNN, it broke the machine that tests
things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we discovered all kinds of fanciful
things that you can do with hemp from an
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one in my archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you always have show and tell down
here, Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm glad you brought that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd bring a piece of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually one of the very first
hemp boards ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was on the board of directors,
and I actually discovered how it was that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could cut this up in order to make it
turn it into boards, because when we sent
[SPEAKER_00]: it to Washington State, and we discovered
that they were using long fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they put it through their fiber
masher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Washington State University,
they have the best, the most advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: composite manufacturing research and
development facility in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funded by the United States
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was after World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: They funded that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where we took it to have
them test the fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they put all those fibers into
the machine, it froze the machine up in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd never had anything do that to
their machine before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than be upset, they were rather
excited, because they'd never had anything
[SPEAKER_00]: do that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to know what this stuff
was all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went on to several year research
and development process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that if you ever wanted to
license this, you could go to Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: State University and purchase the license,
because they own the license for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could learn how to make it,
and the formula is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out there.
