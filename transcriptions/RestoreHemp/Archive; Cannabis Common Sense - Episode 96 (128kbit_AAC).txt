[SPEAKER_01]: Video taped at the studios of City Video,
it is time for Cannabis Common Sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: the show that tells you the truth about
marijuana and the politics behind its
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now here's the host of the show,
Paul Stanford and Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our show is a production of our political
committee, the campaign for the
[SPEAKER_03]: restoration and regulation of hemp,
or CRRH.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the sponsors of the Oregon Cannabis
Tax Act petition, which is out there now
[SPEAKER_03]: circulating, so if you see it,
sign it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the chief petitioners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one, Paul Stanford.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Dr. Philip Laveck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for this exciting edition of Cannabis
Common Sense, we're going to discuss the
[SPEAKER_02]: current state of medical marijuana here in
Oregon and in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is, this is a country on the
cutting edge right now with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: with hemp, it is medically used.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where research or at least
compilation of reports are being done
[SPEAKER_02]: nationwide and right here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what is the actual state right now,
Dr. Laveck, of medical marijuana here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's going on right now is that a
person who wants to use medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: in other words has a disease process,
which includes wasting disease of AIDS,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and some
people even use it for various and sundry
[SPEAKER_00]: types of pain anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is virtually, in particular in
regard to pain, pain is so subjective that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no way for somebody to measure the
degree of pain or the intensity of pain or
[SPEAKER_00]: even the relief of pain or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if a person says I have a bad back or
I have a bad this or a bad that and I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: pain and that smoking marijuana helps,
I don't think that anybody should deny
[SPEAKER_00]: them the right to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's going on in Oregon at the
present time is that people who are using
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for medical purposes have to get
some sort of a letter from a physician
[SPEAKER_00]: which says marijuana will alleviate the
problem pain or whatever it might be for
[SPEAKER_00]: this individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This letter is sent to the Oregon Health
Division and Dr. Grant Higginson is the
[SPEAKER_00]: person who is the, I guess, he's not the
director of the Oregon Health Division but
[SPEAKER_00]: he's the number two person there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one person is not a
physician but he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is the one to whom these letters are
addressed and he is the one who will issue
[SPEAKER_00]: the equivalent of a marijuana user's
license now the strange thing about it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is still a federal offense to,
in many respects, about the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the present time nobody knows what's
going to happen but this hasn't prevented
[SPEAKER_00]: people who get benefit from the use of
marijuana from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are an estimated 100,000 people in
the United States right now who admit to
[SPEAKER_00]: using it for medical purposes and there
are probably, as I understand it,
[SPEAKER_00]: around 10 people, 10 million people,
excuse me, who use marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is, I think the so-called
recreational use of this is kind of a poor
[SPEAKER_00]: term because I don't think people smoke
tobacco for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why people smoke tobacco but
whether it's for recreational purposes or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is because this is a sort of a
strange terminology that is used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So... It's like when they use alcohol,
that's social drinking or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I suppose that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of the social...
Recreational use of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, recreational use of alcohol and the
social use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terminology here is very,
very obscure or muddied or whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: right word is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very imprecise at the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think one of the strangest things
about this is that the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: raises marijuana in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government has it harvested
and processed to make marijuana cigarettes
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are eight people in the United
States who have letters of permission from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Drug Enforcement Administration to use
marijuana for their medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if eight people can use it for medical
purposes, for relief of their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, why can't nine or 10 or a
thousand use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very strange situation and a
year and a half ago I was one of six
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors who testified at the American
Medical Association Convention for the
[SPEAKER_00]: American Medical Association to stand
behind the rights of patients to use
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for medical purposes and this
was passed by the House of Delegates of
[SPEAKER_00]: the American Medical Association in
Dallas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headquarters of the American Medical
Association has, I don't know whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: word is they've sat on their hands or sat
on their heads or whatever they've done,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they haven't done anything about it
and we six doctors have written a letter
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Journal of the American Medical
Association as the equivalent of a letter
[SPEAKER_00]: to the editor asking why hasn't the
American Medical Association taken us to
[SPEAKER_00]: stand on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the first letter we wrote they sent
back that we're sorry but we're rejecting
[SPEAKER_00]: it because we have too many other things
to print in the magazine or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then about six weeks ago the
American, what is it, the Institute of
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Institute of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The National Academy of Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the National Academy of Science came
out, very highly publicized, throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States that there was
considerable evidence that marijuana was
[SPEAKER_00]: good for certain medical problems and the
American Medical Association has been
[SPEAKER_00]: strangely quiet about this but in view of
the Institute of Medicine we six doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: again wrote a letter to the American
Medical Association and the Journal of the
[SPEAKER_00]: American Medical Association to say the
Institute of Medicine says that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: some benefit in medical purposes and why
should people be thrown in jail for using
[SPEAKER_00]: it for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as somebody pointed out a few minutes
ago we are at the cutting edge of this and
[SPEAKER_00]: with the vote I guess the last two
elections we had for medical, for use of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: November of 98 here in Oregon and
Washington and Arizona they voted on it
[SPEAKER_03]: for the second time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They originally voted in 1996 along with
California to legalize medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if I understand right there
are six states who have passed
[SPEAKER_00]: initiatives, is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, six and then that's not counting the
District of Columbia where the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States Federal Congress has not allowed
that vote to be counted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exit polls showed that it passed with 72%
but an amendment to an appropriations
[SPEAKER_03]: writer by Georgia representative Bob Barr
defunded the counting of that vote and
[SPEAKER_03]: said that the District of Columbia cannot
count the vote on medical marijuana that
[SPEAKER_03]: was on their ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well they couldn't count it, they weren't
accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government basically is the
treasurer for the District of Columbia to
[SPEAKER_02]: handle the money and they said they can't
spend any money on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they figured out that since the
machine is already automatically tabulated
[SPEAKER_03]: that it would take about $1.67 of public
money for them to count it because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: already counted the rest of the ballots.
[SPEAKER_02]: See that's what the proponents of it are
saying, the detractors, the Bob Barr folks
[SPEAKER_02]: of the world, they're saying it would
actually cost more like $10,000 because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a whole computer run and time and
all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somewhere in between is part of the
real number but I would kind of think it'd
[SPEAKER_02]: be fairly low and it doesn't matter anyway
because the people should be able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: their voice heard especially in DC which
is the capital of the world these days
[SPEAKER_02]: supposedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The free world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The free world promoting democracy
everywhere except in their own backyard
[SPEAKER_02]: which is quite sad so if you're out there
folks and you believe in democracy I would
[SPEAKER_02]: say write to Bob Barr and send him an
email saying hey what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare you deny democracy to people in
the United States?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't treat DC like a foreign colony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it to Bob Barr or send it to our
senators and send it to our
[SPEAKER_02]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them just sit on their hands
because they know they don't have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't demand anything from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of is a good segue into this
article that our director Lanny Swerdlow
[SPEAKER_03]: sent to our representative here in the
third district in Oregon, Representative
[SPEAKER_03]: Earl Blumenauer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lanny sent him a letter urging him to
support Barney Frank's bill, House Bill
[SPEAKER_03]: 912 for medical marijuana and he got a
letter back from Earl Blumenauer where
[SPEAKER_03]: Blumenauer doesn't really acknowledge that
Lanny asked about House Bill 912 at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also doesn't acknowledge that we voted
on it here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read Representative Blumenauer's
letter in its entirety and then we can
[SPEAKER_03]: dissect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says dear Mr. Swerd, of course his name
is Swerdlow, but dear Mr. Swerd,
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you for writing me concerning the
legalization of marijuana and other drugs
[SPEAKER_03]: for medical use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you contacting me about this
sensitive issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently California voters passed a ballot
initiative that's designed to ease
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictions on medical use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arizona voters approved a similar
initiative but also relaxed controls on
[SPEAKER_03]: heroin, LSD, and methamphetamines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what Blumenauer says.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of these initiatives are at odds with
existing federal law and are opposed by
[SPEAKER_03]: the Clinton administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shortly after these initiatives were
approved, White House drug czar General
[SPEAKER_03]: Barry R.
[SPEAKER_03]: McGaffrey announced that the federal
government would prosecute doctors who
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribed illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many unanswered questions about
the medicinal uses of marijuana and other
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will certainly keep your concerns in
mind should legislation regarding this
[SPEAKER_03]: issue come before Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can be of further assistance,
please feel free to contact my office.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, though Representative
Blumenauer knows that we voted on it here
[SPEAKER_03]: in Oregon, that doesn't matter,
all he knows about is two and a half years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago they voted on it in California and
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though Lanny's letter opened and
closed saying please become a sponsor of
[SPEAKER_03]: House Bill 912 for medical marijuana,
Blumenauer doesn't acknowledge that and
[SPEAKER_03]: says I will keep your concerns in mind
should legislation regarding this issue
[SPEAKER_03]: come before Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is legislation there and you
asked him to be a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get upset about these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's typical of these limousine
liberal Democrats that they just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to offend anybody and they want to
make sure that they keep control of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they can make sure they don't
offend folks and stay in office.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, I talked about recently
California voters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like two and a half years ago in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just quite shocking that he has no
idea whether this is a form letter that
[SPEAKER_02]: his staff composed two years ago and they
haven't updated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dated March 29th.
[SPEAKER_02]: The form letter, though, his staff came up
with two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earl Blumenauer is like, gotta do more
than ride his bicycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got to get out there and see what his
staff is doing in his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be embarrassed if this was letter
going out under my name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Earl, I'm sure you're not watching,
but if you are, you gotta be embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Earl, don't make us, Earl.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many unanswered questions about
the use of marijuana or drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's many unanswered questions
about the use of any substance out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day is an experiment, as I'm sure
Dr. Zveck will tell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they use medicines, every individual
is different and they're not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always find new information about
drugs we've had for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that he doesn't realize or
doesn't acknowledge that a hospital 9-1-2
[SPEAKER_02]: exists is pretty sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so Dr. Zveck, Florida State,
is there every day we find out new
[SPEAKER_02]: information about drugs that have existed
for a long time?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like the book is closed once they
come out with a drug in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's very interesting that
we know from historical records that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has been used for literally
thousands of years and nobody has ever
[SPEAKER_00]: reported any bad effects from the use of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you compare that to tobacco or to
alcohol, there's absolutely no comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: between tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just absolutely none whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the statement that marijuana is a
gateway drug to heroin or cocaine or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, this was verbally thrashed by
the Institute of Medicine that said there
[SPEAKER_00]: was no evidence whatsoever that this was
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the main thing that we're doing
is supporting General McCafferty and a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of DEA agents who are making
very high salaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't want to give up the game,
as you might say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people that are making money on the
marijuana issue are the DEA agents and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who grow and sell marijuana and
don't pay any taxes on any aspect of the
[SPEAKER_00]: money that they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're caught, they get sent to a
federal prison where it costs at least
[SPEAKER_00]: $40,000 a year to keep them in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the federal prisons,
the guards in the prisons are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: also recipients of a lot of money from the
marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a strange, absolutely
bizarre situation that this has gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't understand why some of these
politicians in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: and elsewhere can't see this or understand
it or whatever the right word is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to think that it's just plain
inertia for the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_02]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some minority on one hand,
they're just drug warriors out now,
[SPEAKER_02]: moralistic drug warriors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have a few politicians that
say, yeah, we've got to basically say let
[SPEAKER_02]: people decide for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of them, it's just like status
quo.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to change anything because
this is the system they're used to
[SPEAKER_02]: operating in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think if you brought in an
outside economist who had no exposure at
[SPEAKER_02]: all to the drug underground substance
trade in this world, I don't know where
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd find such an economist, but like the
proverbial man from Mars or something
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in and take a look at this,
and they would laugh at us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd say, well, the way your system
is working, is supposed to work,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the way it's set up, people aren't
paying taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making money, and therefore it's a
drain on the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a burden then on the rest of us
because we have to pay more taxes because
[SPEAKER_02]: those folks aren't paying their fair share
for the roads, the bridges, the sewer
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the fact that it's
costing us money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that they're paying their fair share,
but it's costing us money to build the
[SPEAKER_02]: prisons, to pay the guards, to staff these
prisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: The police to arrest them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: More courthouses they're building.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons that it built
this huge Mark Halffield Courthouse in
[SPEAKER_02]: downtown Portland here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that they're arresting more
people for drug crimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a simple interstate white
collar crime stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all probably need like one or two
judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just something that I think an
outside observer would look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would just crack their head and say,
well, what were you guys thinking of?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that given the end of
prohibition, we're going to look back on
[SPEAKER_03]: the outlawing of marijuana much the way
that we currently look back on civil
[SPEAKER_03]: rights legislation and the Jim Crow laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at the Jim Crow laws that kept
non-European Americans in a subordinate
[SPEAKER_03]: state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look at that and think that was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those laws were wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're glad that that's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're going to look back on these
marijuana laws and do the exact same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we want to urge our
viewers out there to help us lead
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves and our state out of this
morass.
[SPEAKER_03]: That phone number is 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act
petition currently in circulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to tell them what the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act petition will do?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act, it will tax
and regulate the sales of cannabis to
[SPEAKER_02]: adults through state stores, which would
be operated like state liquor stores,
[SPEAKER_02]: which you go and buy liquor in,
or bars for that matter, to adults over
[SPEAKER_02]: the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will also allow patients to get
marijuana at cost in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go into a pharmacy, buy that cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then doctors will be able to prescribe
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of us having to grow your own,
we're getting a caregiver to grow it for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what if you have a brown thumb instead
of a green thumb?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll also allow our farmers to grow
industrial hemp so we can compete with the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the world with industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Modestal marijuana is available at cost at
pharmacies and allow adults to purchase in
[SPEAKER_02]: state-operated stores for recreational
purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the proceeds going to the taxes on
it, basically going to the state
[SPEAKER_02]: government to fund where the state
government decides to fund.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put 90% of the proceeds, and we expect
there's going to be a lot of money
[SPEAKER_03]: generated by this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't really say what the amount will
be right now, but let's leave that aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, we denote that 90% goes into the
state general fund.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be up to the legislature to
decide how to spend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully they'll put it into education.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there'll be a lot less need for
prisons and courts, so they won't be
[SPEAKER_03]: putting it there, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the remaining 10%, 8% goes to fund drug
abuse treatment programs for people with
[SPEAKER_03]: alcoholic and other substance abuse
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 1% would go to a comprehensive
drug education program for kids in schools
[SPEAKER_03]: to teach them about the dangers that
substance abuse can have on their
[SPEAKER_03]: development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, the final 1% goes to fund a
state agricultural committee that will
[SPEAKER_03]: support and promote industrial hemp
products made from fiber, protein,
[SPEAKER_03]: and oil, and their associated industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need your help, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That number is 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a website out there that Paul
over here is real good at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty amazing website that Paul
puts stuff together on, including our
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch this show on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the website address?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's www.crh.org.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've won every major web award.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were named by Netscape as What's Cool,
by Project Cool as of today's siding,
[SPEAKER_03]: by Cool Side of the Day as a Cool Side of
the Day, Choice Side of the Month.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've won most major awards for our
websites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I encode videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's over 100 different videos you
can watch there, feature length movies
[SPEAKER_03]: like the 30s classic Reefer Madness that
shows that if a person smokes marijuana,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll go crazy and kill their family and
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the 1930s movie that helped
criminalize it, one of them anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other feature length films and
documentaries like ABC's Pot of Gold about
[SPEAKER_03]: the economics of cultivating marijuana,
CNN's Higher Times.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are literally 100 different shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently we have about 25 of these shows
on there and a backlog of another 20 to
[SPEAKER_03]: encode and put up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we urge you to look at our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually print our petitions out
from the website if you have a laser
[SPEAKER_03]: printer using the free Adobe Acrobat
printer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can't use the internet,
though, call us at 503-235-4606,
[SPEAKER_02]: as we're getting used to here to having to
always give the area code from now on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Dr. Vivek, I wanted to ask you,
that the one thing that I've heard some
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors say is about whether or not
marijuana that it can cause is depression
[SPEAKER_02]: when people try to get off marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you hear anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people who smoke marijuana
and I have never heard that said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, here we have it, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, he's a professor of
pharmacology and toxicology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think you'll find many people
more qualified to make a statement I
[SPEAKER_00]: think, excuse me, but I think the
comparison might be easy to make about
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens when somebody tries to quit
smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the patch and the chewing gum and
the pills and all of those things they can
[SPEAKER_03]: take to quit smoking tobacco, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: For folks that have problems, there's also
groups called Marijuana Anonymous out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They aren't used by many people,
but if you'd like to quit smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana, we recommend that you contact
Marijuana Anonymous if that's what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you feel you're having a problem,
talk to somebody about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, we don't believe in
substance abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe in adults choosing wisely and
using wisely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we believe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on that note, we ask you out there to
write your congressperson and to support,
[SPEAKER_02]: ask them to support House Bill 912,
the federal version of medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced by Representative Barney Frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's House Bill 912.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write to them, call them, ask them to
support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the Salem session winds down to an
end, ask your local representatives to
[SPEAKER_02]: support the letter to the federal congress
asking them to support medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a letter, but it's a call?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a house resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee, I can't remember the number right off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do write to your, or call your
state senator, they'll know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say the house resolution supporting
medical marijuana on a federal basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just says that, you know, now here in
Oregon that we have medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_02]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: should catch up to us and the other five
states that have supported medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana and voted for it overwhelmingly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'd like to urge you again,
we want your help in this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: petition drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we need about 100,000
signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need 66,748 valid registered Oregon
voter signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to turn in 100,000 to ensure that
we qualify.
[SPEAKER_03]: So call us and get our petition at
503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us are volunteers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need your help.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can sign it, if you can get your
friends to sign it, even if you can just
[SPEAKER_03]: get one or two signatures, call us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that petition at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then turn around and send it right back to
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got the petition already,
send it back to us right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't delay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stick it in the back bedroom drawer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send it back to us so we can get it into
our account and help build up to that
[SPEAKER_03]: 100,000 signatures so that we can force a
vote to regulate the sale of marijuana and
[SPEAKER_03]: restore industrial hemp here in Oregon and
restore freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: So call 235-4606 or the webpage www.crrh
.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good night and thank you Dr.
Levesque and thank you Paul.
[SPEAKER_03]: My pleasure and thank you viewers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.
Good night.
