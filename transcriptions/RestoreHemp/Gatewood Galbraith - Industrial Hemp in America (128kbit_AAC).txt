[SPEAKER_00]: And the question of hemp, the question of
cannabis, is the most vivid illustration
[SPEAKER_00]: of how this government has overstepped its
bounds in policing the private behavior of
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they told us we couldn't plant a hemp
seed in the ground, they severed us from
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what they seek to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the synthetic subversion,
for they want to replace all the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: products on earth that used to be grown
out of God's earth and God's seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And replace them with synthetic products
and knock our farmer out of the agrarian
[SPEAKER_00]: society and the agrarian market and make
the ghost towns of our small cities and
[SPEAKER_00]: villages across this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to rediscover a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that will allow our farmers to go back
to the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that will allow our farmers to compete
with the petrochemical pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7% agricultural land in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to import another drop of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can replace the spills in the gulf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can replace the environmental
catastrophe that the petroleum pipelines
[SPEAKER_00]: have cast upon Mother Earth and instead
let our farmers grow hemp as a fuel crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1991, Willie Nelson and I poured hip
oil into my Mercedes diesel and drove it
[SPEAKER_00]: across Kentucky in my bid for governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he started his biofuel plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have been handed a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting old up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we cannot make this ball much
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to become educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to reach out there and grab the
responsibility of maintaining your
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every generation must re-win its own
freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those very sacrifices right up to the
very last second I've been talking to you
[SPEAKER_00]: made on your behalf cannot continue
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really counts is your own commitment
to what sacrifices you're willing to make
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future to maintain your freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is right there in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to learn the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to learn the political
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to reach out there and
take responsibility of your own freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live your life like a warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me out here in Seattle.
