[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing Seattle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine a better group that I
would rather have on my side so I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am from Ohio and we've got a few good
things beginning in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I've been working on this for a
long time but we have a couple different
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot initiatives going on or attempting
to go on that we're gathering signatures
[SPEAKER_00]: for and then we also have a medical
marijuana bill that I have personally
[SPEAKER_00]: helped write.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole life I have not been heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a little girl I couldn't speak
until I was five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally found my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have given me the courage to find
my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a laundry list of things going on
with my body but let me first give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little background on Tanya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tanya Davis does not have a criminal
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tanya Davis is not a drug addict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tanya Davis has just found out that I have
massive calcium deposits that are on my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks ago I was hospitalized so the
laundry list don't even matter anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I got all past that I've learned
to deal with that but the massive calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: deposits on my brain it's not like I have
cancer and I can go have chemotherapy and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: My calcium deposits are causing severe
brain damage and before anyone makes any
[SPEAKER_00]: comments no I have never done
methamphetamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is not the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found out that causes
crystallization or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone made a smart ass remark so but I
am not about all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I am about is fighting for my right
to use this medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a medical marijuana patient and I
choose to eat my medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay back to the calcium deposits on my
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's causing severe damage and medical
marijuana may be the only thing that can
[SPEAKER_00]: save my life or give my part of my brain
that isn't covered in calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: A chance to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I truly with all my heart if you need a
reason to stand up for what's right use
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please use me because I believe I can be
utilized in this movement in a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: way and that's honestly you know when they
told me that I was going to speak on this
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful main stage I was scared to death
but then I got to thinking in my mind hell
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking to a few hundred of my
own friends 200,000 of my own friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got over that a little bit but I'm
still scared to death guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana might be the only thing that
will give me a fighting chance and I'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: damned if our federal government is going
to stop me from making this choice because
[SPEAKER_00]: don't I deserve to have a fighting chance
at least?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys just gave me chill bumps by the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes so what if it makes you feel
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fucking what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go to look me up Tanya Davis Ohio
in on Facebook friend me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what's going on with me if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I promise you that until I have my
very last breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you and thank you.
Thank you guys so much.
