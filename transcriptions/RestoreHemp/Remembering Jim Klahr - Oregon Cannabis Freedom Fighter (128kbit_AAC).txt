[SPEAKER_00]: From my experience in the legislation,
I have found that we really don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody in the House of Representatives
who is there to back the wants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: needs of, regardless of what your part of
cannabis is, whether you're an industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, medicinal marijuana, choice to use,
or sacrament, I believe in them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have a place and they should all
come together and we need to change what
[SPEAKER_00]: this state for sure needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we have to be here and we
have to be on the inside to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, if we want all these changes we
talk about here at this festival,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to get out there and vote and get
that ballot in the mail and make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: register.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be able to enjoy what
I've been able to enjoy for almost 40
[SPEAKER_00]: years now and that's cannabis in whatever
form you choose to believe in it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a pre-transplant patient at HSU
and so I'm kind of under the thumb of
[SPEAKER_00]: being held out of the system because I
can't use it when I know that it worked
[SPEAKER_00]: for me before I was evaluated and put on
the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been on both sides of the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it medicinally to take care of
my needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: My life is basically on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use and they find it in my system,
then they'll take me off the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might as well shoot me right then and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a type of bias that we don't
need in our world, much less our state,
[SPEAKER_00]: much less this district.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody should be able to do what they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long before that, I was a farmer and
it's time that farmers are no longer slave
[SPEAKER_00]: labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be paid for what they do and
paid righteously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the other part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to have the medical system
and our new transitional health care bring
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis into it from a positive section
to where the OHA starts protecting any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the clinics, any of the growers,
any of the patients from outside
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like what people are doing
and don't want to give them the best
[SPEAKER_00]: health care they can, then you really
don't give a shit if they live or die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those type of people don't belong in
any sort of politics or politic position
[SPEAKER_00]: or office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running for a state office because I
think we got to really clean up what we
[SPEAKER_00]: got going here and hopefully those changes
just like our bottle law did years ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: those type of things drip downward and
outward just like it will as more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: states come online.
[SPEAKER_00]: With whatever form of legalization they
choose to do.
Thank you.
