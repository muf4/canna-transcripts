I
[SPEAKER_01]: was sitting in my daddy's car With a joint
in both of my hands Smoking till the smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't stop And the windows rolled down
and I'm rolling around In my mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting for the time to fly There's a fork
in the road and I know where to go But I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: scared to do it And I'm as stoned as you
are, firing far I'm a listening fool and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know just where to go But don't take me
back to where I came from I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: go back to where I came from I'm only
sitting and listening as my baby tries to
[SPEAKER_01]: take me home I'm only sitting and
listening as my baby tries to take me home
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright baby, let's get down
[SPEAKER_01]: There's calm in your eyes Like a shadow
falling Taking the piss from mine You've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a way to persuade Well, but I ain't
going nowhere No, I ain't leaving today
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only sitting and listening as my baby
tries to take me home As my baby tries to
