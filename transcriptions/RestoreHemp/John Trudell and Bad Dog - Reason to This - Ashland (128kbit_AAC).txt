[SPEAKER_00]: Last night, in a dream, I interrogated
God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it the good die young?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the reason to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked, we argued, we cried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did get any answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But God knows I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answers already know a question for

[SPEAKER_00]: Claimed it, then took it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glorifying obedience and fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stamping uncertainty into the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rampage through the mind.

to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: With anything.

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
