[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, as we all know,
alcohol prohibition didn't really end
[SPEAKER_00]: until the women got involved, and I
believe that's true for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, although I'm not speaking just to the
women today, I really strongly suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's time for women to step up and
stand next to our brothers who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting this fight for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for it to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may not know it, but cannabis
prohibition is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep hearing these large
organizations tell us to wait till 2014
[SPEAKER_00]: and wait till 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of my brothers and sisters
getting put in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of kids being taken from their
families because they choose to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly safe intoxicant after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am tired of being scrutinized for using
a benign plant as my way to relax in the
[SPEAKER_00]: evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to wait till 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to wait till 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am calling my state legislature every
day, and I am telling them it's time for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to support and pass HB 3371.
[SPEAKER_00]: That legalizes cannabis for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't leave anybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have a card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do anything but be over
21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works for me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do this now if every one of you
makes the call.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out your phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out your phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you the number to call right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free to call.
[SPEAKER_00]: 800-332-2313.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number again is 800-332-2313.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them your zip code.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they hook you up with your
representative, you just have to say one
[SPEAKER_00]: sentence, please support and pass HB 3371.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ends it for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bill creates an emergency situation
which would enact the law immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we don't have to wait till MPP
says we can do it in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we don't have to wait till
normal says we can do it in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we can do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you guys got to do is call.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take a huge amount of us to make
those calls to make this happen because
[SPEAKER_00]: they take the impact of those phone calls
as being the voice of 20 of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of you out here, all 100 of you
or however many there are, by you making
[SPEAKER_00]: the call, you represent 20 more of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: By making that call, you represent 20
fellow cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make this happen now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people to go to jail anymore
for weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cost inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just plain wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please join me and call 800-332-2313.
