[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years old, happy birthday, Vivian,
the entire multi-hundred person crew has
[SPEAKER_00]: done one of the most amazing jobs in the
world at focusing attention on a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivian, hey, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivian is keen to say that this is a
critical mess and we've reached a critical
[SPEAKER_00]: mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we reach a critical mass here every
year in the hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: people beyond coming to the park,
join a marijuana law reform organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not matter which one you join,
just get involved, register to vote,
[SPEAKER_00]: donate to this great organization,
the Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the next year, 2012 will be the
busiest year for marijuana law reform and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumers in every single one of
our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're 75 or 18 years old,
2012 will be the busiest political year.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Oregon, Washington State,
Colorado will all have legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: ballots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Massachusetts will have a
medical marijuana initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any one of these states passes a
legalization initiative, that will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: chink in the armor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be the rocket ride to the
Supreme Court where a state, not
[SPEAKER_00]: activists, not patients, not
organizations, but a state will be in such
[SPEAKER_00]: conflict with federal law that the Supreme
Court must rule on whether or not a state
[SPEAKER_00]: can legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are on the precipice, 55%,
55%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% of Americans want marijuana legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demographers believe that by 2020,
60% of Americans, whether you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative or you're a liberal,
you will want marijuana legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fait accompli.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a matter of if or how,
it is a matter of when marijuana will be
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not in doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: California's Proposition 19 last year only
lost by three percentage points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three percentage points.
[SPEAKER_00]: A state like California, which is a nation
unto itself with one out of eight
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans living there, came within three
percentage points of legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have a great opportunity on
October, October 2nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this on your little iPhones and your
Android phones right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: October 2nd is the 74th anniversary of
this terrible prohibition on marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a blessed opportunity on that
Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal is calling for all of us to have
normal, hot parlor parties on that night,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only to celebrate the destruction of
this stupid prohibition, but public
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcast will start a five-part series
that night on the alcohol prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Ken Burns series on the absurdity of
alcohol prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at your normal pot parlor party,
the whole idea is to watch this great
[SPEAKER_00]: series on how alcohol prohibition that
only lasted a dozen years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a stupid policy, what a failed social
experiment it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are all these years later,
74 years into marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's self-evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom is not mana from heaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be free, work for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
