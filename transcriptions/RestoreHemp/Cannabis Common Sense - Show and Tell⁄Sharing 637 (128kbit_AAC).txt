[SPEAKER_00]: You got your PhD from the University of
Oregon Medical School, which is now known
[SPEAKER_00]: as Oregon Health Sciences University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you were there, I know you told
me the story about finding huge gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: jars of cannabis in the cupboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started as a grad student at the
medical school, Dr. David, the chairman of
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharma College, says, Leveque,
I'd like you to go in and straighten out
[SPEAKER_01]: the stock room, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just straighten it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing I found was a gallon
jug of cannabis cough medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, it was illegal for
cannabis of any sort to be anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was 13 years after 1937 or so,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was manufactured by Park Davis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, well, if Park Davis paid me
to go to medical school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just said, if Park Davis says this
stuff is good for cough medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: it must be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I poured myself a pint of it like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably out in my barn
someplace, and it's probably still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an Eli Lilly container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do our little show and tell
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are several cannabis based products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is Sunny Hemp from Nature's Path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick these up at most local drug,
uh, grocery stores, not drug stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: but grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, they're nifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little hemp bars next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, uh, Emerald, uh, Empire Hemp
Munch, uh, toasted hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald, uh, the Hemp Company of America
is based right here in wonderful Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's a tasty snack right next
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a hemp tea product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to drink these in Switzerland back
in, uh, the late nineties and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, marijuana was actually legal in
Switzerland from, uh, uh, 1997 to 2002,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, when an initiative made the ballot in
Switzerland, Switzerland invented the
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it became, went into effect from 97
was voted down, uh, 40, 52 to 48% in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, United States DEA spent about $10
million to defeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in a country of 4 million Swiss
voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our federal government went in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug enforcement administration spent
$10 million to make sure the Swiss hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: bill lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so next door we have a embossed bottle
of, uh, Dr. Uh, Craddock's, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys with the HDTV, you
probably, oh yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Indica from Dr. Craddock of
Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania, right next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a full bottle speaking of cough
syrup of Lyndon's cough balsam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it is, uh, uh, it's got about a
dozen different languages on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, uh, mostly Polish and Eastern
European languages right next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a, uh, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the glycerin phosphates compound
with less than a reconstructive tonic and
[SPEAKER_00]: nerve food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one in ingredient is
Cannabis Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we have two bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one still in the box that's
unopened and I'm not going to open that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a lot more valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one just has some residue inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Lloyd brothers, cannabis
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, uh, another nifty thing that
shows its medical utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, we have Eli
Lilly's uh, pint bottle, uh, fluid extract
[SPEAKER_00]: number 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had about a dozen different cannabis
compounds, uh, including powdered hashish
[SPEAKER_00]: and fluid extracts and tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they mixed it just like this
other one, uh, the glyso phosphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Nervine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they mixed it with several other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't uncommon to find these,
uh, nerve potions that included cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there it is from Eli Lilly.
