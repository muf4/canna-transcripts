[SPEAKER_00]: This hero died before he could see the
freedom which he fought for most of his
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our elders are dying every day and with
them goes a knowledge that may never be
[SPEAKER_00]: recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forced some for their entire lives to hide
what they know instead of sharing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: others for fear that others may seek to
end their lives to keep this information
[SPEAKER_00]: from the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education is the only way to get the
freedom we seek for this plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding will only come when the
people open their eyes to the possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have been misled by the media
and certain corporations or government
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations about the true purposes of a
naturally occurring substance which had
[SPEAKER_00]: had a symbiotic relationship with all life
on earth until the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discrimination and prejudice towards the
cannabis plant and those who choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize its broad applications will always
exist if fear and ignorance are the only
[SPEAKER_00]: tools being used to fight our oppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me or have seen me around I've
usually got a camera that's kind of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do as an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go places, I meet people, I participate
in the global cannabis community because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a global community which we are
trying to represent here today as a
[SPEAKER_00]: respectful and informed group of concerned
citizens that want their opinions to be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized I have had a tremendous
opportunities over the last decade or so
[SPEAKER_00]: which allowed me to travel to great places
and meet even greater people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank the people and
organizations that helped me to reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: and educate others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I've been involved with many
organizations and groups looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: forward the movement towards true cannabis
freedom you know like where it's growing
[SPEAKER_00]: on your parking strip like roses I believe
that individual activism is the real key.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to sign up with only one
group of people you can find your way into
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple channels of this beautiful plant
and its abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always preached that there are
three types of uses for the cannabis genus
[SPEAKER_00]: plant type industrial hemp, medical
cannabis and recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you know your pot you just
might not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously though there are a ton there's
ton of information about the plant and its
[SPEAKER_00]: uses in its multiple forms so please do
some research and tell your family what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strike up a conversation about something
you know about cannabis that the person
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking to probably doesn't know
and they will find an interest because you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the hot topic talking point right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
