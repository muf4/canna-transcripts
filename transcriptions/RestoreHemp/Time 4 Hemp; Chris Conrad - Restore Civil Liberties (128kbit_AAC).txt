[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I'm Casper Leach and it's time for
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a program that has been designed
to put together the information,
[SPEAKER_02]: facts and figures regarding the hemp,
also known as marijuana plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also trying to focus on the
historical past and maybe even more so
[SPEAKER_02]: should we say economical past of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today my guest is Chris Conrad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Conrad is a leading spokesperson for
America's new hemp slash marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: restoration.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the National Director of both the
Business Alliance for Commerce and Hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: also known as BAC, and the New Republic
Agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is on the Executive Board of America's
Hemp Council, the Family Council of Drug
[SPEAKER_02]: Awareness and Southern California's NORML,
which also stands for the National
[SPEAKER_02]: Organization of the Reform of Marijuana
Laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris is a recognized authority in the
environmental, economic, civil liberties,
[SPEAKER_02]: social, medical and political aspects of
hemp slash marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: He designed and edited Jack Herr's
enlightening book on the uses of history,
[SPEAKER_02]: uses and history of the hemp plant,
The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining us, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little bit about the BAC
organization, please?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, the Business Alliance for Commerce
and Hemp was formed a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_03]: by a group of investors and business
people and activists who are concerned,
[SPEAKER_03]: and researchers who are concerned about
the current trend of American politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only in terms of the suppression of
civil liberties involved with the
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana movement, of course,
but with the suppression of the economic
[SPEAKER_03]: alternatives that are available by
developing hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have basically four goals that
we're working for.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is the deregulation of
commercial non-smoking uses of hemp for
[SPEAKER_03]: things like paper, fiber, fuel,
food, things like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second is to restore the medicinal use
and availability of hemp as a medicine or
[SPEAKER_03]: as an herbal user.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next is to restore the civil
liberties, the freedom of choice of the
[SPEAKER_03]: individual in terms of what they garden or
what they choose to consume in their
[SPEAKER_03]: leisure time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the final one is to develop a system
of outlets and other kinds of ways of
[SPEAKER_03]: handling a domestic hemp industry that
would be for consumption through smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something along the lines of the wine
industry where the individual can grow it
[SPEAKER_03]: or it could also be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I've always gotten the
impression that this movement is primarily
[SPEAKER_02]: an organization trying to get a bunch of
old hippies together so they can get out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and legalize marijuana so they can
smoke the brains out, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you're saying is it's a little
different than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing is that if there were a bunch of
old hippies who got together and went out
[SPEAKER_03]: in the fields where they're growing
commercial industrial hemp, they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get to smoke their brains out
because it contains so little THC that it
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't be good as a psychoactive
substance or as an intoxicant or however
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to refer to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a relaxational... Why do you mean by
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a different kind of hemp plant than
what you get high with?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's still a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is, of course, a scientific name
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp is the American or English name for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana is just an expression that
William Randolph Hearst picked up from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, they don't even use it in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it mota down there or kanyamo.
[SPEAKER_03]: But marijuana is just a slang word that we
use nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of how you cultivate
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were growing it very densely
together, you'd get a lot of stem,
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit of leaf, very little THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you spread it out more, you'll get more
of the branching and flowers, and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: where your THC is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But isn't relegalizing sending a wrong
message to kids, especially when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, all right, dudes, go out there,
get high, party your brains out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you're sending a wrong
message to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first off, prohibition isn't really
about sending messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about sending people to jail,
and there's a big difference between these
[SPEAKER_03]: two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're not saying that, for example,
tobacco and alcohol, these are things that
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't condone as a society as such,
but we do allow people to have that
[SPEAKER_03]: freedom of choice, especially adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a way of simulating the difference
between a child and adult is that when you
[SPEAKER_03]: reach a certain age where you can consume
alcohol and tobacco, that's considered
[SPEAKER_03]: toys of the adults, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so marijuana will be placed similarly
in a category like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but won't kids have easier access to
it if you legalize it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would say actually less so.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is because when we see countries like
the Netherlands or Spain and countries
[SPEAKER_03]: where they have legalized marijuana for
private use, they find that actually the
[SPEAKER_03]: use goes down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hits a stable level in society,
and part of that is because the mystique
[SPEAKER_03]: of doing something illegal is taken away.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is that if it's being
vended by someone who is a distributor who
[SPEAKER_03]: has a license on the line and pays fees,
and they know if they sell it to children
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're going to lose their license
and their distributorship, they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do it, whereas if it's in the
hands of criminals who are attempting to
[SPEAKER_03]: make money by whatever hook or by crook
they can do it, they don't care who buys
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we know that marijuana is a
gateway drug, and that it leads to other
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs, and it leads to more damaging
effects, and it leads to all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If nothing else, it leads to lack of
motivation, which then you have people not
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to work, and therefore you even
hurt the economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the National Education Association
and the National Academy of Sciences both
[SPEAKER_03]: say that tobacco is the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtually everyone who smokes marijuana
has already experimented with tobacco and
[SPEAKER_03]: with alcohol by the time they get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to look at it in terms of
addictive psychoactive substances,
[SPEAKER_03]: most people start off with sugar and
chocolate, then they move on to tobacco,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they go to alcohol, then they
start smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: By then, they're halfway into this
pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is the pattern of behavior of
abusive dependency.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the problem is not whether
they smoke marijuana or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you know, sugar is not as bad
for you as smoking marijuana is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if sugar rots your teeth and you
smoke marijuana, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, right off the bat, there's an
obvious difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they say that, you know, lung cancer
makes you sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very dangerous thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we have to deal with a lot
of false studies right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of bad information that's
being pushed around as if it were true.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the lung studies,
250,000 or so people a year die from
[SPEAKER_03]: tobacco-related lung problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not one person in history has ever died
from smoking marijuana, and yet the
[SPEAKER_03]: government tries to tell us that marijuana
is 50 times more dangerous, but it just
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: The brain damage thing had to do with
killing some monkeys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They suffocated the monkeys, and they
found they had brain damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that they used marijuana smoke to
suffocate them, if they had done the same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing with a plastic bag, they would have
found the same effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: These studies are not scientifically
valid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have control groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have replicatable evidence to
support what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're discredited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason that these are even toted
around right now is the fact that the DEA
[SPEAKER_03]: and groups like the Partnership for a
Drug-Free America, which is, you see their
[SPEAKER_03]: ads on TV a lot saying, you know,
that marijuana is this or that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you notice they don't say anything
bad about alcohol or tobacco, even though
[SPEAKER_03]: these are the most abused drugs in our
society.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for that is because something
around 60 percent of their funding appears
[SPEAKER_03]: to be coming from groups like Philip
Morris, who have a vested interest in
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they gain by saying that marijuana is
bad, because you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_03]: gateway effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: What social behaviorists call the real
phenomenon there is called drug switching,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is that people who tend to take one
substance or another, that they'll use
[SPEAKER_03]: one, and when they use one, that they
don't use the other one as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened in the 60s and the 70s
is that as marijuana became more popular,
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption of alcohol and tobacco went
down, and so these companies that are
[SPEAKER_03]: selling these products are now saying all
these things, putting out these false
[SPEAKER_03]: reports about health damage from
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now you've got all these wonderful
facts and statistics, but you cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: ignore the fact that Alaska, after 15
years of having marijuana legalized,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, turned it around and admitted a
crime again to possess it.
[SPEAKER_02]: California has had 17 attempts to legalize
with initiatives the hemp plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they've all failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, with the political
climate as it is, how come you're out here
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing it like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes you think someone's actually
going to sit there and go, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is true, let me see the deal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no one said it was going to be an
easy process.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are politically difficult times
because there's a tendency towards
[SPEAKER_03]: repression on the part of our government
that they have the hard line approach to a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the fact that for 17 years people
have been trying to get it legalized here
[SPEAKER_03]: by the initiative process in California
well, what is a crime and what is a habit,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, is a question there of personal
choice, because you don't see murderers
[SPEAKER_03]: out there organizing to get murder
legalized or thieves out there organizing
[SPEAKER_03]: to get theft legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Criminal acts, we don't have political
groups working for the legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the case of marijuana, the fact that so
many people are working for it shows you
[SPEAKER_03]: that this is a political issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the immobility of government,
there are two things on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that maybe we've been using the
wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe initiatives are not the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they are, but maybe they're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is more likely is that we should go
through approaching the deregulation
[SPEAKER_03]: process, which would be a step-by-step
process of, as we say, first the
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial non-smoking uses, then the
medicinal uses, then the private
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption, and finally an industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happened in Eastern Europe is a
good example of what can happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pressure builds and builds.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the change comes, it comes very fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're talking about changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be as soon as one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be as far away as five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But look how it took one month for the
Berlin Wall to come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that society was much more repressive
than what we're going through here with
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we have here some items, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Made of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to get a chance to go over those
in the second half of the show,
[SPEAKER_02]: if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very impressed with some of the
things you've had to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've been very enlightening,
and I'm sure that the second half will be
[SPEAKER_02]: just as informative.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I feel now is an unusual approach
to the topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's business, as you've taken it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You felt that it's going to be a
million-dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a million-dollar job
maker, open all kinds of jobs for
[SPEAKER_02]: different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it really is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that something that we should
consider at this point, though,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that we have here an example of a hemp
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, most people's awareness of it is
limited to this area right here,
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaf area, which is frequently called
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, actually, the most valuable part of
the plant is not this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, of course, generates $43.1 billion
a year in the United States, which is...
[SPEAKER_03]: That much?
[SPEAKER_03]: Earned by Americans cultivating it for
marijuana, selling it to other Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegally?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's correct, in the illegal
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's selling marijuana right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's selling for something in the
neighborhood of $200 to $400 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was legalized, it would be talking
about this probably being $100 a pound
[SPEAKER_03]: that people would be paying for the bulk
areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there would be your connoisseur
grades and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there would be a wide variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's misleading to deal strictly on
the economics of this part of the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the real value is going to be in
this part right here, the stem,
[SPEAKER_03]: which contains a large percentage of
cellulose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It includes fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the roots of the plant are important
because they're a part of conservation
[SPEAKER_03]: programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can be used to anchor soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in California, we used to
have a program to prevent mudslides.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would plant hemp on hillsides that
were threatened during rainy seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we still have the same problem with
the mudslides on the hill, but we can't
[SPEAKER_03]: grow hemp on the hillside.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to hold it in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that is because hemp
can grow up to 20 to 30 feet within one
[SPEAKER_03]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_03]: It puts out approximately about as much
root underground as it puts plant above
[SPEAKER_03]: ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it puts out extremely strong
anchoring roots that not only do they
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent the erosion, but they actually
enrich the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I never would have been aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see some of your viewpoints.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, the creating of the jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you've got to take into consideration
there's going to be some jobs lost,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, like the loggers who are cutting down
the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you talk about doing it for paper,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do about those
people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to put them on welfare?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when the automobile was invented and
people stopped using buggies, then the
[SPEAKER_03]: buggy drivers had to go out of business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people who made buggies went out
of business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened was that society made a
transition into what we consider now as
[SPEAKER_03]: the modern era, where people learned how
to drive cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: The buggy drivers learned other trades.
[SPEAKER_03]: The companies that had been making the
buggies started to make automobiles and so
[SPEAKER_03]: forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simply not a transition society.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't be anchored onto this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a suicidal system that we
have nowadays, which is based upon
[SPEAKER_03]: petrochemical and poisonous substances.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, learning here is quite a bit of an
experience, I must say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said earlier, we have a public
service announcement I'd like to bring to
[SPEAKER_02]: you from the United States Department of
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find this to be a very interesting
approach from our government for our
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is their way of letting
the world know exactly where they stand,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least back in 1990.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1942, when they originally released
this during World War II to help with the
[SPEAKER_02]: war effort, should we say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we come back, we'll spend more
time with Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long ago, when these ancient Grecian
temples were new, hemp was already old in
[SPEAKER_01]: the service of mankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: For thousands of years, even then,
this plant had been grown for cordage and
[SPEAKER_01]: coarse cloth in China and elsewhere in the
East.
[SPEAKER_01]: For centuries prior to about 1850,
all the ships that sailed the Western seas
[SPEAKER_01]: were rigged with hemp and rope and sails.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the sailor no less than the hangman,
hemp was indispensable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A 44-gun frigate, like our cherished old
ironsides, took over 60,000 pounds of hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: for rigging, including an anchor cable 25
inches in circumference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Conestoga wagons and prairie schooners
of pioneer days were covered with hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: canvas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed, the very word canvas comes from
the Arabic word for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, hemp was an important crop
in Kentucky and Missouri.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then came cheaper imported fibers for
cordage, like jute, sisal, and manila
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp, and the culture of hemp in America
declined.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, with Philippine and East Indian
sources of hemp in the hands of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese and shipment of jute from India
curtailed, American hemp must meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: needs of our Army and Navy as well as of
our industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1942, patriotic farmers, at the
government's request, planted 36,000 acres
[SPEAKER_01]: of seed hemp, an increase of several
thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal for 1943 is 50,000 acres of seed
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kentucky, much of the seed hemp acreage
is on river bottom land such as this,
[SPEAKER_01]: along the Kentucky River Gorge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these fields are inaccessible
except by boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus, plans are afoot for a great
expansion of the hemp industry as a part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the war program.
[SPEAKER_01]: This film is designed to tell farmers how
to handle this ancient crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now little known outside Kentucky and
Wisconsin, this is hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful how you use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For to grow hemp legally, you must have a
federal registration and tax stamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is provided for in your contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask your AAA committee man or your county
agent about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget, hemp demands a rich,
well-drained soil such as is found here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bluegrass region of Kentucky or in
central Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be loose and rich in organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor soils won't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil that will grow good corn will usually
grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is not hard on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kentucky, it has been grown for several
years on the same ground, though this
[SPEAKER_01]: practice is not recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dense and shady crop, hemp tends to
choke out weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a Canada thistle that couldn't
stand the competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead as a dodo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus, hemp leaves the ground in good
condition for the following crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: For fiber, hemp should be sown five pecks
to the acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: With drill, the closer the rows,
the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: These rows are spaced about four inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hemp has been broadcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it should be sown... Very
interesting, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's exactly where Uncle Sam
stands on the topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest, Chris Conrad, seems to stand
very firmly on it being a very interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: and lucrative way of generating prosperous
economy in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's not the way the
government stands on hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a realistic answer to why the
government should be on hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the government is on hemp is quite
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're doing is interfering with the
private sector's ability to develop a very
[SPEAKER_03]: valuable natural resource that could
create a trillion dollars a year of income
[SPEAKER_03]: for Americans, produce tens of thousands
of jobs, 50,000 new products could be
[SPEAKER_03]: brought into the market, or products that
were currently made could be made out of
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our current policy is to depress all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said now we have some products here
ready right in front of us that you say
[SPEAKER_02]: are made of hemp, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be gracious enough, please,
to share what you have brought with us
[SPEAKER_02]: with our audience?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we've got here, the first thing I
should show you is this shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is made of hemp with a blend with
cotton.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a 55% hemp, 45% cotton.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's made of hemp, 55% hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: It lasts longer, it's 26% more water
absorbent, it's more insulative,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's much stronger than regular cotton
would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the foreground here, I've got three
pieces of paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them, this is like a
parchment-style paper here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what your Declaration of
Independence and Constitution were
[SPEAKER_03]: originally written on, a paper similar to
quality as this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a filtration paper here,
tea bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that you need to have stay strong
when it's wet, because hemp fiber is
[SPEAKER_03]: strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't lose that when it's in water.
[SPEAKER_03]: This in the middle looks like a newsprint
type of paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pulp paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's made of hemp, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they use this back in the early days,
like around Constitution time or
[SPEAKER_03]: something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they didn't use this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a pulp paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used more like this, the fiber paper
that's... And they wrote on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Manuscript paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, over here we have some seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is used as bird seed right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to get the birds high, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's called happy bird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, birds sing better because when
they use it, we don't know if it's...
[SPEAKER_03]: There's very little THC in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be because it moistens their
throat because it has a lot of oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's 30% oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right next to it here, we have some
hair gel.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is made from hemp oil, and it's also
got some herbs in it, some of the herbal
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, moving forward a little further,
we see some other products that are made
[SPEAKER_03]: from the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the seed is crushed, it produces oils
and a...
[SPEAKER_03]: This high-protein powder here,
which is called seed cake, this is more
[SPEAKER_03]: nutritional than any other thing that we
know of, excepting for soya.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in terms of digestibility,
it's more digestible than soya.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it actually... When you look at parts
of the world like Northern Africa and
[SPEAKER_03]: Bangladesh and these areas where there's a
lot of mass starvation, a lot of that is a
[SPEAKER_03]: result of international laws that are
preventing them from growing hemp for use
[SPEAKER_03]: as a food supply, which it has been for
thousands of years for these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The law is the Single Convention Treaty of
1961 by the United Nations, and you notice
[SPEAKER_03]: that the big periods of starvation began
in the mid-60s, late-60s, and continue on
[SPEAKER_03]: to today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within 10 years of banning hemp,
starvation became part of the norm for
[SPEAKER_03]: these parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, these two pieces of oil and samples
of oil, this is a raw oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see it's got a little brownish color,
similar to the seed itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, on the other hand, has been
distilled, and so it's cleaner-looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make anything from machine oil to
cooking oil out of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all fibers from the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a rather raw fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called a tow line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of these are from Russian hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Russian hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this string here and this rope,
they're both from Hungarian hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been made into a bag here through
a macrame process.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've wrapped it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a potholder made out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your balls of twine, this tea bag back in
here, and it swings this right back down
[SPEAKER_03]: to the plant from which all these products
can be made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now, if you can make all these
things, that sounds grand, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But aren't you going to have a problem
with, like, re-educating and retooling the
[SPEAKER_02]: market for people learning how to work?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that to loom with cotton,
you use different types, a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different type loom than you do with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to have your car running
around, running on methanol, right,
[SPEAKER_02]: or is it methane?
[SPEAKER_03]: Methane would replace natural gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, methanol, then it means you've got
to turn the whole car over, turn the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: industry over, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the strong points about it is
there's a big incentive because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: billions and trillions of dollars of
profit that can be generated, and very
[SPEAKER_03]: little retooling is actually required.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the car needs a conversion
unit, and then it can run on the methanol,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you wouldn't have to let, for example,
if you tried to make a hydrogen-powered
[SPEAKER_03]: car, you're talking about some major
retooling, with a methanol-powered car,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just a matter of one new part that
needs to be put in to make it more
[SPEAKER_03]: workable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other plants that can make
all these things, that can do all these
[SPEAKER_02]: things?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are plants that can be used to do
different parts of it, but as far as doing
[SPEAKER_03]: all of them, that's another matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get back to the other question
about the retooling, though, because,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, that's why they have the
cotton blend in with the hemp here,
[SPEAKER_03]: because balloons are set up for a short
fiber like cotton, and hemp has a long
[SPEAKER_03]: fiber, and so in order to make it work,
all they did was blend it with the cotton,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they'll still get a lot of the
benefits of the hemp, but without having
[SPEAKER_03]: to do the retooling that would otherwise
have been required.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make the oil, for example,
is similar in quality to that made from
[SPEAKER_03]: jojoba plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that's all you can make from
jojoba, and it's a desert plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a long time to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp grows copiously throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we have these massive
eradication programs, because it produces
[SPEAKER_03]: so much, and it can grow anywhere in the
continental United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper and fiber can be made out of things
like knaf, or sugar cane can be used for
[SPEAKER_03]: making paper, for example, if you live in
the tropics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't live in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're saying is there's only one
plant that you know of that can do all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these things in all of the climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of plants that can do one or
the other of these things, but there's
[SPEAKER_03]: only one that can do it all and produce
the amount of volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to go for fuel production,
for example, that's going to take tons and
[SPEAKER_03]: tons of biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no plant that can do that on the
continental United States excepting for
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp to produce the volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Corn produces one-tenth as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing it for biomass,
you're saying that it does a cleaner thing
[SPEAKER_02]: to the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you describe it, it almost cleans
the air while it's up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet we've got cars throwing dinosaurs and
shells up in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say that there is a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this audience would know
about what biomass is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biomass is energy that's produced from
living plant organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a carbon that's in the living
plants that's then converted through a
[SPEAKER_03]: process that makes it into anything from
gasoline to charcoal instead of coal to
[SPEAKER_03]: methanol and methane gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make all kinds of energy from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make all those same sources of
energy basically out of fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that's from living things that
were around millions of years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference is that when you go to dig
the fossil fuels out of the ground or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you're talking about drilling,
you're talking about strip mining,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about pulling the stuff out
of the ground, burning it, putting it into
[SPEAKER_03]: the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're going for a biomass,
you have the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the crop grows, it takes carbon dioxide
out of the air and it puts out oxygen
[SPEAKER_03]: through a process known as photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're constantly recycling the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the cleaning up is concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also reverses the greenhouse effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is such a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If hemp can do all these marvelous things,
why aren't other countries jumping on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bandwagon and saying, well, we're going to
grow hemp and we're going to make paper
[SPEAKER_02]: and fuel and fiber out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, America knows something that
the rest of the world doesn't seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, a lot of countries are doing
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, we mentioned that this stuff
here is from Russia.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are from China.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Hungary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Czechoslovakia produces it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yugoslavia produces it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of the world that does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the United States does is we control
a lot of the technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: The technology needed to move into the
next era of hemp agriculture and hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: commerce and the hemp trades, which we're
suppressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the machine that breaks down
the hemp was patented in 1936.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp was outlawed in 1937.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those patents were not released to the
rest of the world where hemp was still
[SPEAKER_03]: being grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have just one more question to make it
short, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of timetable do you think we're
on as far as making this legal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's inevitable in terms of the
environmental and economic pressures
[SPEAKER_03]: against us.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we go into a depression or a heavy
recession, it'll probably happen within
[SPEAKER_03]: the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say anywhere from one to five
years, depending upon the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance and the ability of the American
people to understand not only the
[SPEAKER_03]: importance of this thing, but how the
individual gains from it by more freedom,
[SPEAKER_03]: more choice, more products available,
more job opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if anybody's interested in finding
out more about Bach organization or the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we have here made of hemp,
there's a number and an address flashing
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of your screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can contact Bach.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the number and address that's
showing there, or you can contact the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: organization, and there'll be somebody
there to be happy to answer your
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have really enjoyed having you as my
guest today, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have.
[SPEAKER_03]: My pleasure, Casper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you hear from some of your viewers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot more information,
as you know, that we can't get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before meeting you, I had no idea of half
of what you were telling me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope the viewers find that to be true,
too, with themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's ever a chance to have you back
on, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for joining us here
for Tying for Hemp, and I want to give a
[SPEAKER_02]: very nice thank you to the lady who made
my wardrobe, Sherry Rose, and as any nice
[SPEAKER_02]: artist, she always signs her work,
I must say.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's helped me to look good today,
and I want to thank the people here who
[SPEAKER_02]: have worked very diligently in getting
this production put together, and thank
[SPEAKER_02]: you for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll come back again pretty soon,
and the next time we have a chance to
[SPEAKER_02]: chat, look for Casper Leach, Tying for
Hemp.
Thank you.
