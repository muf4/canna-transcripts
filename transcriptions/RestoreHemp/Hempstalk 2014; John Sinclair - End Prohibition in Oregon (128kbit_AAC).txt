[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to be in Oregon where you're about to
do something really smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is to get the police and the
authorities of our complete society out of
[SPEAKER_00]: our lives so we can get high and enjoy
ourselves without having to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: these goons and their uniforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our first hippie gathering in
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm from in 1967.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't have as good of a sound
system or a stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: The police rode down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're always in Ann Arbor when we
used to have free concerts every Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have to pay off the police to
not come onto the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to stay in the parking lot and
take care of the parking traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we thought if they came in to the
free concerts they would just kill
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd be walking around with their
helmets and their guns and their radios
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that horse shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to pay them off to keep them
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today this is a new low for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a hemp stock organization has to pay
these guys to come in here and hassle us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once you legalize it you get that
over with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all due respect to these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they serve an important role as
security guards in our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, I feel secure as a motherfucker
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel really unsafe with this kind of
environment of armed, uniformed characters
[SPEAKER_00]: walking amongst us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I can talk about the police all day
but I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really a poet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became an activist because the police
wouldn't leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to fight back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of y'all ain't even 50 yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really ecstatic to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to give you a few poems if I
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to fuck up your afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, this is what I do when they ask
me to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start with a prayer inspired
by the music of John Coltrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is jazz?
[SPEAKER_00]: But spirituals played through saxophones
and trombones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spirit voices through metal tubings and
the terrible repetition of the formal
[SPEAKER_00]: premise is trance-like at its best or
boring when the spirituals spirit does not
[SPEAKER_00]: move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh what is blues but spirituals with the
line remove?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is structurally and in content just a
prayer to the gods of daily life to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: the blessing that the body of another may
lay warm in the bed beside you at night
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rent be paid and a meal on the
table with the sheriff far away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene of the crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh what is jazz but the registration of
the human personality?
[SPEAKER_00]: In relation to the spiritual stripped of
literal meaning but full of sound and
[SPEAKER_00]: portent direct as the voice of the gods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spiritual.
Yeah.
Thank you.
