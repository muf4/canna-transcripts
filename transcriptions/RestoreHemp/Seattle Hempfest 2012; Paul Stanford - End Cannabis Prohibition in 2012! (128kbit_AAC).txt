[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing you can't get away from my
talk is that marijuana, hemp, is the
[SPEAKER_00]: oldest crop purposely grown by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 12,000 years ago, the first
agricultural settlements in Mesopotamia,
[SPEAKER_00]: along the Tigris and Euphrates River,
present-day Iraq, and on the opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: flank of the Himalayas in China,
along the Huanghe River, the Yellow River,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of those civilizations started
growing marijuana, you know, hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it because it's the plant that
produces the most fuel, the most food,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most fiber, and the most medicine than
any other plant on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, to prohibit the plant that
makes the most fuel, the most food,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most fiber, and the most medicine than
any other plant is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working hard to try to achieve
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are a number of ballot
initiatives out there this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I particularly have been working in
Oregon, because that's where I live,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we put a measure on the ballot there
we call Measure 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would legalize any individual to grow
their own, without any artificial limits
[SPEAKER_00]: on the amount that they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also doesn't have any limits on the
amount that you can possess, as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: it's for non-commercial use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It frees horticultural hemp, so the seeds
and starts of all varieties of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: will be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it legalizes hemp for fuel,
fiber, and food, without regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only regulation is that the strains
that grow the best quality and the best
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity of fiber will be the ones that
Oregon farmers can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's also an initiative on
the ballot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-502 and one in Washington, I mean in
Colorado, Amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three states will vote on various
proposals to legalize marijuana this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of those pass, we'll change the
whole dynamic of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all three of those initiatives pass,
that would be like the end of the Cold War
[SPEAKER_00]: and the falling of the Berlin Wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like the toppling of the
Statue of Lenin in Red Square back in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all three of these initiatives pass,
it will send a message that the people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to put up with marijuana
prohibition any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there was a good
breakthrough just this past week in Kansas
[SPEAKER_00]: City, Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: A jury was impaneled to prosecute some guy
for possession of marijuana, and he hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: bought some tax stamp they needed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jury revolted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got angry at the prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told him they aren't going to
prosecute this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the judge threw the charges out and
made it where he can't be tried again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get an opportunity to serve on jury
duty, go there and just say no to
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them you're not going to convict
anyone for a marijuana crime because
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana isn't a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have a booth over here,
the Epic Cannabis Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've helped over 20,000 people in the
state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altogether, about 150,000 people all
across the country get their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a blessing for us and a blessing
for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find out more about it,
come right over to that booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have information about Oregon's
Measure 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be voting on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in closing, I just want to say you
need to register and you need to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get out there and get your
friends to register and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a real historic opportunity to end
marijuana prohibition this year in just
[SPEAKER_00]: about two months, two and a half months.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do, it'll send a ray of hope to
those people that are in prison all around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, here in America, there are over
1,000 people in prison for life without
[SPEAKER_00]: the possibility of parole who never grew
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, never heard of other person,
never stole anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there just for growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out there, register to vote,
and make history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go hip-bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go hip-bass.
Go hip-bass.
