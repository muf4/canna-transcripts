[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling the feeling of something gone
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you define what you can't explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the dragging on, hunger gnaws on long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in self-defense, long keeps gnawing
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the thoughts don't know what to
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I've been doesn't remember a
thing about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something strange going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that had unraveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's rambling back into all I
thought I'd escaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those places I don't want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't want could care less about any

[SPEAKER_00]: And reality didn't even blink.

[SPEAKER_00]: That bitter taste looks for someone sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling the feeling of something gone
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you define what you can't explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a shadowing of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plunged to the edge, collided with
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reality didn't even blink.
And reality didn't even blink.
And reality didn't even blink.
And reality didn't even blink.
And reality didn't even.
