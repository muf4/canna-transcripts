[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the reasons that so many
Americans are angry is they see a criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: justice system which comes down very
heavily on the poor and on people of
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Vermont, Oregon, or any place some kid
gets picked up with marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kid is likely to have a police record
for the rest of his or her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently, if you are an executive on
Wall Street whose greed and illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior destroyed this economy,
nothing happens to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Wall Street has got to learn and
corporate America has got to learn is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are going to bring justice back to a
broken criminal justice system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got to rethink the so-called war
on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that over the last 30 years,
millions of Americans have police records
[SPEAKER_00]: for possession of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that the Federal Controlled
Substance Act lists marijuana as a
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule I drug right next to heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I have introduced legislation
to take marijuana out of the Federal
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substance Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about drugs, all of us
have got to recognize that in my state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermont, neighboring New Hampshire and all
over this country, we have a major crisis
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of opiate addiction, heroin
addiction, and people dying every day from
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have got to do as a nation is to
understand that the most effective way to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with drug and alcohol abuse is not
making them crimes, but making them health
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
