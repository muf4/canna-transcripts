[SPEAKER_00]: The more people that get to use the
medicine, the more people will not only be
[SPEAKER_00]: healing their physical ailments,
but the mental ailments that come from not
[SPEAKER_00]: having enough cannabinoid activity,
either because you're just genetically a
[SPEAKER_00]: little weak on it, or you're not eating
the right foods, or you're not using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think is that the more and more
people use it, the less they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to cling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the federal government is not going to
go down easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to do everything they
can, at every step of the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain some element of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we all know that the truth and
reality is on our side, so that it'll be a
[SPEAKER_00]: progressive weakening of the stupidity
that they continuously enforce as we build
[SPEAKER_00]: the strength of knowledge and truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you, one of the roads we're
going down now with Cannabis Science has
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with HIV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without going into details,
because we haven't released things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to say things that are not
properly press released.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, the reality is that
there's somewhere between 35 and 50 more
[SPEAKER_00]: million people in the world today with
HIV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that number is so dramatic that it's
going to cause not only the collapse of
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, but of countries and
potentially the African continent in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States does not want that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot produce enough antiretroviral
drugs for 50 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible because of the
complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can make cannabis products to
satisfy that size of a population need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have 50 million people learning
the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that sense, it's irrevocable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government's position will collapse
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing everything we can to make
that happen sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
