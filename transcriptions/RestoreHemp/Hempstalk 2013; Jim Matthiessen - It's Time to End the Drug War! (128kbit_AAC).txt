[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just got the word they got
these new initiatives coming out to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize marijuana in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that all of you should do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I think that is because if
you don't, they're going to legalize it
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the legislature to legalize it
for you and make all the rules?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to make the rules
yourselves by legalizing it yourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's kind of the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, you can keep sitting
back and waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really there's something that's got to
get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we don't want to be,
you know, late on the history of this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon's right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, California and Oregon are the
next states to legalize, I do believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time for us to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look back right across from the
main stage here, there's the THC clinic
[SPEAKER_00]: back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The CRH right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right over here is the paperwork on this
new initiative stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if you want to register to
vote, as I think you ought to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking you to vote for president
or none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you can't control your
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you do it is that you control
your neighborhood through your vote
[SPEAKER_00]: locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initiative process is that's how
we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it happened in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it happens in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's going to happen right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you know, we've got to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many people in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many people in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because that's what's morally
wrong about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd like to, yeah, maybe I'd
like to sit back and make all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: money selling herb or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that isn't the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way it works is that we've
got a bunch of people in prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time for the thing to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the bars opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let everybody out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, we do need jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it for criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, rapists, murderers, thieves,
you know, they're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough to keep the cops busy right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they don't need to be chasing us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to be chasing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you youth, especially, man,
hear my message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, step up, register to vote,
and change our local rules a little bit by
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing marijuana in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, there's more than one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a constitutional amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, there's a couple of different
things going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can vote on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a constitutional amendment that
means that nobody's going to go to jail
[SPEAKER_00]: for this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's an important thing.
