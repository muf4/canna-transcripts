[SPEAKER_00]: The surest way to empty a room is for an
old guy to start telling his life story,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I promise you I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote The Cultivator's Handbook in 1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote it because, at the time,
we were engaged in a terrible war in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: DEA didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the FBI enforcing drug laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard Nixon, our criminal president,
was the man in the White House.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been growing for a couple of
years, and I realized that if we were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be free, truly free in this
country, we had to be able to grow what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to consume, whether it's marijuana,
whether it's our own garden of vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is you want to grow,
if it's a natural plant, if it's a free
[SPEAKER_00]: gift from God, that is your right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those rights don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless people like Paul Stanford and
Oregon Normal enforce those rights in our
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when somebody like Paul Stanford
goes to his state representative and says,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an organization with 200 people
in it who vote, they're going to yawn at
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he says, I've got an organization with
2,000 people in it and they vote,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he says, I've got 10,000 people and
they're all registered and they all vote,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the politicians listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as much as I hate belonging to
organizations, and those who know me will
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you, I don't belong to many,
I think it's incredibly important that you
[SPEAKER_00]: give Paul and Madeleine and the other
folks here from Oregon Normal and from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hip and Cannabis Foundation your support
by registering and voting and showing up
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever it's possible to let your numbers
speak where your voices may not be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you all for coming
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for being the
generation that's going to make it finally
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm probably your grandfather's
age, your grandmother's age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working at this for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys work at it for another 40 years,
but I'll guarantee you before one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: more years is out, this whole scene is
going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you work to make other,
get rid of these other oppressive laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking away our freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show up, vote, join the organizations that
are making a difference in your lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you all and God bless Jack
Carrara.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you all.
