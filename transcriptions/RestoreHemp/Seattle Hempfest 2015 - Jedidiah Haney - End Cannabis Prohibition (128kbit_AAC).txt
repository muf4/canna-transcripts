[SPEAKER_00]: HempFest!
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy HempFest!
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh boy, happy HempFest, guys!
[SPEAKER_00]: This is huge!
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your personal freedoms at work!
[SPEAKER_00]: You think this stage gets built out of
midair?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all these Canna warriors around
you, volunteering their time, putting
[SPEAKER_00]: their energy into this effort,
which is called Cannabis Freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So celebrate!
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is our day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow is our day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day should be our day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking, trying to think why,
what I want to talk to you guys about,
[SPEAKER_00]: why I'm up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm thinking to myself,
last year I was just out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: a vendor handing out cards, giving out
information, telling people, keep
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington green!
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People were like, what do you mean keep
Washington green?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just legalized it!
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this look like legalization to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're fleeing to the rocks and
under the trees to smoke some freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of our HempFest crew and
our HempFest staff because they're keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: our freedoms alive and our dreams alive
and they're doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This reminds me of years past in HempFest
when we still celebrate our freedoms and
[SPEAKER_00]: we still smoke cannabis where we want to
and how we want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So celebrate!
[SPEAKER_00]: Celebrate today!
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a main message to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This battle is not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a recreational scheme which we
have in our state where you can purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I voted for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fighting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know business owners that are putting in
their due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know some really lame business
owners that are doing some poor stuff for
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry, but we won't talk about that
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we will talk about is the fact that
just because we can buy it in a store
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow it in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke it where I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.7 million people in this state voted for
I-502 and about three-quarters more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that still think that you can grow plants
in this state just because you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a medicine card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all need to get educated about
what our public policy is, what our state
[SPEAKER_00]: policy is, and get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one thing's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clamored up to the state politics this
last year and observed the most
[SPEAKER_00]: dysfunctional state legislative session in
entire history of Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through three sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one session plus two more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we couldn't even figure out our state
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you're watching,
the state Supreme Court just sued our
[SPEAKER_00]: state legislature $100,000 a day until
they figure out how to educate our
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I voted for cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taxing it, and they can't even
educate my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you guys to get involved because
this is not going to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go up there and tell them,
I want my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to be shoved through a
tax-regulated system and come out dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have my rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to get our rights
until we get up there, we clamor up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell all of them, this is how I want
it, and I want it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we don't do that, what they're
going to do is they're going to do what
[SPEAKER_00]: they did to 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to stifle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to throw 54% in this state
into default of a state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually in conflict with our state
constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read Article 11, Section 11,
it's only two lines long, so please look
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, no jurisdiction can pass laws
that are outside of general law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they cannot ban cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot ban our rights to safe access.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot do what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to go into those city councils
and those county commissioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to tell them, you are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says so right here in our constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't care what organization and
what attorney general comes out with any
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, our citizen rights stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get involved with me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only put in a couple of days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do a lot of fun things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with awesome people every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people share cannabis with me every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do that, they break the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be a professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be whoever I want to be and have
the right to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to have that right,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to pay attention to one other
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Denver, Colorado, maybe they're doing
it right, maybe they're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing they are doing is they got a
general ballot to a local level to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in public at any location that
has any other smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are in a cafe or restaurant and
they have a smoking area, you can consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis out there if it's OK with that
owner of that entity, right, of that
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all around here frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to smoke some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to go over here to the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can serve alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tax alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can serve cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what is going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes, what was it, 3,700 citizens
in the city of Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you it takes a little bit around
that here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask you one last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you care about cannabis and you care
about freedom of cannabis, get involved.
Woo!
