[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take a few of you people who have
smoked some weed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad to hear that because I want
to talk about the past, the present,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the future and get an idea of what I'm
thinking from somebody who's been around
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I first want to start off by
mentioning my dear friends, Kevin Black
[SPEAKER_00]: and Peter McWilliams, both of whom are
friends, personal friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this stage is honoring them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say honor them with high honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter McWilliams and Kevin Black,
two wonderful activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the past is concerned,
I spent a lot of time in court working to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep people out of prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every day I'm in court working on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a very good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for 20 years plus of
being an expert witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing a change in the way the
cases are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing a change in the attitude
around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also seeing the fact that we're
getting rolled back at different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of what's going on here in
Washington, for example, is not exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what people envisioned when we passed
I-502 here a few years ago to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it wasn't supposed to affect
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet look at the problems it's causing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, we have the legislature
that's got a bill that claims to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana reform bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they're going to do is take away
legal defenses for pot growers who are not
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed by the state that we've had ever
since 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just their idea of reform is
to make it so that some people will get
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses, but other people lose their
legal defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the other thing that we're seeing
is that this whole idea of testing
[SPEAKER_00]: people's urine as a part of a condition
for getting a job or to have a license,
[SPEAKER_00]: these issues are not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the cannabigatry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the Jim Crow of cannabis is what
we're setting upon us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of these things that we're
seeing as we see reform are things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: also are concerned about where things are
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the past, one of the
things that's a big fear for me as we see
[SPEAKER_00]: this big change that's happening now is
that the history of the struggle to get us
[SPEAKER_00]: to this moment can very well be lost and
we can't afford to let that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people who've been sitting in
prison for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people who've been working as
activists for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a history of people who worked
underground, people who kept the jeans
[SPEAKER_00]: pool alive and so forth for all these
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to protect and honor that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with a group that's called the
420 Archive and we're trying to approach
[SPEAKER_00]: this from three different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is to get the archives of people
who've been contributors to the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis reform and preserve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is to create collections and to
coordinate collections of museum exhibits
[SPEAKER_00]: of material that goes from before cannabis
was ever prohibited and up through the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of this prohibition and to create
that as something that we can leave for
[SPEAKER_00]: future generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third thing is to get oral
histories of people who've been using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis underground and growing
underground and working in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry underground that have never been
free to tell their stories before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those stories of the people who risked
many years in prison to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: other people had some nice herb to smoke
is not lost in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you'll join us in looking at the
420 Archive and make sure that history is
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is about the now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the now is that as cannabis moves out
of its outlaw status, we have a big fear
[SPEAKER_00]: that what's going to happen is big
corporations are going to come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to try to take over control
of the work that our friends and our
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors and the people who've been the
growers and so forth for so long have been
[SPEAKER_00]: working for and have patented seed lines
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working with a group called the
Open Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our plan is to try to get a final way
of explaining what the different seed
[SPEAKER_00]: lines are in terms of the genetics and
their effects and so forth, but also to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve them and create the public domain
record that these already exist so that
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto and corporations like that can't
come in and patent those seeds and make
[SPEAKER_00]: you always have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that you'll always be
able to grow your OG Kush and your
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without having to pay some corporation who
comes in and buys that trademark away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the name of that group is called the
Open Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got three parts to protect access to
the seed lines that exist now.
[SPEAKER_00]: To protect the integrity so that when
people tell you that this is a blue dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know it's really a blue dream and
not OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of which are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not knocking either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, you want to know what you're
getting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third thing is to get the genome
mapped so that we will know for sure from
[SPEAKER_00]: here on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then the next thing I wanted to say
is that what we're heading towards in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, things have shifted really
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have Dr. Sanjay Gupta changing
his position on marijuana, which has led
[SPEAKER_00]: to this whole massive shift, which was
marked last week when the New York Times
[SPEAKER_00]: came out in favor of taking marijuana out
of the Federal Controlled Substance Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really hugely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we've been saying for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now finally we've got the New York
Times joining us to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm predicting that the future of
cannabis is that we are going to see more
[SPEAKER_00]: and greater hemp vests in the future,
more and greater freedom in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: a protection of what we've got,
an expansion of our rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you all to join us in the more
important things is that we need more
[SPEAKER_00]: people smoking herb and more people to
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've written a book, which is
called The Newbies Guide to Cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be out this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you know people who should be
smoking weed or who should be in the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: business and you want to make sure they
get it right and don't screw themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and screw each other and they understand
what's going on, tell them to get a copy
[SPEAKER_00]: of that book for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then the last thing that I wanted
to say is that save hemp vests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get into your pockets and raise some money
for this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization doesn't pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you guys to contribute,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that you're here today,
but Steve and everybody else is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you, make sure that there is a hemp
vest next year by contributing when the
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't wait for the buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy the stuff, the mementos and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the things that are going to keep hemp
vests going because without hemp vests,
[SPEAKER_00]: I-502 would not have passed in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have legalization today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd all be much worse off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please join us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: With one last cheer, give me a hemp,
hemp, hooray!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, hemp, hooray!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, hemp, hooray!
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll see you guys on
theleafonline.com.
