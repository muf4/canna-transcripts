[SPEAKER_00]: And we love our dark skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not ashamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not embarrassed We are not
humiliated by the racism in this country
[SPEAKER_00]: because the people that are pushing it out
there They're the ones who should be
[SPEAKER_00]: ashamed of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us are disgusted by racism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that shit One of the things that I
need to talk about today is not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization which we're continuously
fighting for Marijuana use in this city in
[SPEAKER_00]: this state It's supposed to be legal,
but we still have to worry about where we
[SPEAKER_00]: can legally use where we can legally
medicate My son is right now on RSO oil
[SPEAKER_00]: for his seizures He has grandma seizures
The only thing that helps him and his wife
[SPEAKER_00]: who has epilepsy is the use of the
cannabis and the oils that it produces but
[SPEAKER_00]: having access to it is the biggest problem
for him because you know what if you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: afford to get it as a medical patient and
keep up all the bureaucracy and Policy
[SPEAKER_00]: behind that then being a recreational
user.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still being criminalized and
especially a child with brown skin Who has
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures who might seize during a car
while he's driving?
[SPEAKER_00]: He might have a seizure at the time that
he's walking his kids to the park and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know What's my biggest fear is that hat
happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: That happening and the police hurting him
taking his life because they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's having a attack They don't know
that he's having a health issue at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time Because of how we see people that
utilize marijuana in this country One of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that he has to deal with not
only the seizures, but having to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: racism every day He is in an interracial
relationship His wife was told one day by
[SPEAKER_00]: a child that she grew up with that She was
a breeder now because she had mixed kids
[SPEAKER_00]: by my son how humiliating for not only
them as a couple that's trying to live in
[SPEAKER_00]: the year 2017 2018 in America to be
humiliated by racism, but to know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pushing that on their children I
Advocate for a lot of children and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I tell them is that the things
that are happening right now They're not
[SPEAKER_00]: their faults and they don't have to carry
on the same traditions and values and
[SPEAKER_00]: policies That we've been taking into
consideration to reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to break these systems Fuck
reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for reconstruction And when we
talk about reconstruction We know that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't take rocket science to make
outside public consumption a thing We know
[SPEAKER_00]: that it adds to the value of public safety
because people don't have to hide what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing When they're trying to deal
with the curls of today all of these ills
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're dealing with all of the things
that are creating PTSD and all of us if
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't have PTSD before the Trump
inauguration You got it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the hospital watching it on
morphine Dying coming out of a surgery and
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that we were in for a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got out of that hospital ready I got out
of that hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I connected with the ACLU.
[SPEAKER_00]: I connected with Indivisible, Oregon I
connected with my community and we kept
[SPEAKER_00]: moving Because the fact that we're getting
tired of fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that we're losing It just
means that we have to be more innovative
[SPEAKER_00]: in the way that we do our outreach
everybody Should be on the front line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody should be behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have saviors in this movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have allies we have comrades We have
people that fail the same way that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: and the only thing that is in between us
is legalities People think that speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: out freedom of speech that that's violent
people see it as violent if they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: control the conversation We have right now
with the legalization in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon the opportunity to change that
conversation This industry is making money
[SPEAKER_00]: that money can be used for our education
and I'm not talking about only the
[SPEAKER_00]: education in our schools I'm talking about
political education when our numbers and
[SPEAKER_00]: our neighbors understand the value of what
we're talking about when we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to influence policy when they
become the allies in this fight we will
[SPEAKER_00]: win when we invest in elected officials
that understand the priorities when we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about public safety and marijuana use
and Not having our children be tased and
[SPEAKER_00]: chased and shot for having a joint or a
pipe in their pocket When they understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the value of integrating what they believe
is a better future into what we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about having access Liberation then that's
when those things will change put your
[SPEAKER_00]: money in this industry where our future
needs to be Give our children access to
[SPEAKER_00]: the guidance that they need give them a
blank slate Let's make something that
[SPEAKER_00]: matters happen We don't have to propagate
the falsehoods of the people that we elect
[SPEAKER_00]: that come to us with lip service vault
them out Vault them out if you don't trust
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them a chance we in this
industry We understand what second chances
[SPEAKER_00]: look like and we haven't gotten them from
an elected leader We haven't gotten them
[SPEAKER_00]: from a political relationship or
legislation They just keep putting our
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas and our thoughts and our necessities
on the back burner no more I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: see a revolution I remember when new
approach and Anthony Johnson when all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that was happening and I was standing on
the front line as a candidate for
[SPEAKER_00]: Multnomah County because I understood it
to be a health necessity I understood that
[SPEAKER_00]: having access to it that it would decrease
the necessity for our courts to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: us on a criminal level and it would
encourage our health departments and our
[SPEAKER_00]: health resource operators to utilize it as
a leverage where there is no opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: for Those that do not have access to the
health care that will make us healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know RSL works It's on the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works We know that legal consumption if
done properly through our through our
[SPEAKER_00]: process Don't let somebody who's never
used weed tell you how to policy it how to
[SPEAKER_00]: legislate it how to make it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's normal for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be normalized by the
bullshit politics So let's create what we
[SPEAKER_00]: need and let's do it together smoke You
You
