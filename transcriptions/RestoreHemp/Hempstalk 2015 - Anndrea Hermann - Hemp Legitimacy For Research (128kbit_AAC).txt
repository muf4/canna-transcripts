[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone on to do my master's in Hemp
Fiber Agronomy at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Manitoba and now I am also dual citizen in
Canada and I've been there as I said for
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished my 15th year of THC
sampling under the authority of Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and also trained other samplers and
have diversified that area of work and
[SPEAKER_00]: helped labs set up and understand the
regulatory reviews that we need to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: this sector as we move forward overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were here earlier you would enjoy
talk about what's going on in Congress so
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely check out votehemp.com and go
to the take action tab and reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: your congressional leaders asking them to
co-sponsor the Industrial Hemp Farming
[SPEAKER_00]: Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your voice is being heard we are picking
up co-sponsors all the time from various
[SPEAKER_00]: states and now we're looking at 27 or 28
it's pretty much changing daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: States in the United States that have
legalized cultivation of industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and thus then are qualified underneath
section 7606 of the Farm Bill Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Legitimacy for Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes so eight states this summer cultivated
industrial hemp in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight states.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people did a lot of work to make
those eight states happen and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people right here in Oregon made that
happen also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally assisted with the project of
a North Dakota State University it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: one closest to my heart because I had
direct contact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought in 12 varieties from three
different countries and planted those up
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean on the Canadian border but in North
Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were from France, Canada and
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The collaboration from our international
partners right now have been amazing to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with us to import their cultivars and
steward their varieties here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States really gives us an opportunity to
use what is known and have the data to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare to look at yields for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because without the farmer we don't have
the cultivation of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody thank a farmer because
without them we have no food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely want to invite everybody up to
the Canadian Hemp Trade Alliance
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference that's coming up in Calgary
Alberta in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check me out at HempTechnologies
.com Hemp-Technologies.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the builders of the first hemp
Cree houses in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have some workshops coming up
in Seattle Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be checking those out also in Calgary
prior to the Canadian Hemp Trade Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition I am the president of the Hemp
Industries Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the national non-profit driven to
industry for industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please go to theHIA.org It is a
national non-profit so your membership
[SPEAKER_00]: even as a supporting member or
volunteering for a state chapter just like
[SPEAKER_00]: you have right here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So volunteering for these state chapters
and events like this is really what helps
[SPEAKER_00]: get the message out and having a positive
attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition I am the instructor of WSC 266
Oregon State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the world's first three edit credit
hour course that you can take to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: university credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anywhere in the world you can take WSC
266 and get three credit hours to go
[SPEAKER_00]: towards your university degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a back core class so it fills lots of
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it at three o'clock in the
morning I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and that's right here at Oregon State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see what's also driven here and
that came through the renewable materials
[SPEAKER_00]: division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I think if you're over 65 and you're a
resident of Oregon you can take it for
[SPEAKER_00]: like $25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of the E campus extension services
classes so that's all right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we're already planning for the
cultivation trials next year and part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is getting all of the DEA permitting
that you need to actually bring the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: in which includes phytosanitary,
import export documentation and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that every single one of
those pieces of paper of course are filled
[SPEAKER_00]: out properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nice thing is is now with rules
that we have sitting in Congress and one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those being the appropriation bill
which essentially is the budget for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice and in this budget
it says that they cannot contravene
[SPEAKER_00]: section 7606 of the farm bill which means
none of the funds for the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice can be used to stop the
importation of industrial hemp seeds as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as they're done with the proper
paperwork into this country to foster an
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp industry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and we are definitely fostering and
we are part of a global movement so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look about what's going on around the
globe right now with the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp in various different
languages and everybody coming to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table to want to help to grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we move forward we want to help
support groups that put on things like
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp stock because without them our
community will start to fall apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out and volunteer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually be good citizens and help pick up
garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely go to votehemp.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Andrea Herman and free the hemp
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
