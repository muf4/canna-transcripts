[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's very interesting that
we know from historical records that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has been used for literally
thousands of years and nobody has ever
[SPEAKER_01]: reported any bad effects from the use of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you compare that to tobacco or to
alcohol, there's absolutely no comparison
[SPEAKER_01]: between tobacco and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just absolutely none whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the statement that marijuana is a
gateway drug to heroin or cocaine or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, this was verbally thrashed by
the Institute of Medicine that said there
[SPEAKER_01]: was no evidence whatsoever that this was
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the main thing that we're doing
is supporting general mechanics and a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of DEA agents who are making
very high salaries and don't want to give
[SPEAKER_01]: up the game, as you might say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people that are making money on the
marijuana issue are the DEA agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the federal prisons,
the guards in the prisons are probably
[SPEAKER_01]: also recipients of a lot of money from the
marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a strange, absolutely
bizarre situation that this has gone on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't understand why some of these
politicians in Washington DC and elsewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: can't see this or understand it or
whatever the right word is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a battalion scout and point man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any of you guys are veterans,
you know what the hell a point man means.
[SPEAKER_01]: The life expectancy is about 30 minutes or
so, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in a war history writing class
with about 10 Vietnam guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told them that I was a point man and
scout.
[SPEAKER_01]: They says, oh, no, you weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I says, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, nah, you weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were, you'd be dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am, mean as hell, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you read the story in the
Oregonian last week about the DEA trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get hold of your patients' children?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you raised your hands?
[SPEAKER_01]: You read that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me tell you, the DEA skunks and
the local cops are all going crazy because
[SPEAKER_01]: you bastards have permits to use
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the board took away my license in
November three years ago, I was really
[SPEAKER_01]: disgusted with this because they thought
that they were punishing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not punishing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were punishing my 4,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get the idea that they were trying
to stop the medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is the best drug we have found
so far for the treatment of PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the last month, I just wrote an
article that marijuana prevents PTSD
[SPEAKER_01]: suicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got about 1,000 comments from all
over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I was in the military,
but I didn't see combat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know as a marijuana user that
when I smoke marijuana, I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I quit using marijuana after a
couple of days, I start to have some very
[SPEAKER_00]: vivid dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, the use of marijuana will
help.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of the worst symptoms of PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably wouldn't imagine what the
second most important symptom is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not being able to talk about what was your
worst experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about your worst experience.
Bang!
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you feel that way after World War
II?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you went through a lot of very
traumatic experiences in fighting your way
[SPEAKER_00]: into Germany and meeting up with the
Russians there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first day, I was committed to combat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got in an artillery barrage that just
blew the hell out of the little town where
[SPEAKER_01]: I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next day, they hit me with a
mortar barrage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we crossed the Rhine River,
I got strafed by German planes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got strafed by American planes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost 150 men in less than an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of how many?
[SPEAKER_00]: 150?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of our battalion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a battalion is what?
[SPEAKER_00]: About 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 150 out of 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty heavy nutrition rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15% in an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: My battalion, my division, had the worst
casualties crossing the Rhine River.
Thank you.
