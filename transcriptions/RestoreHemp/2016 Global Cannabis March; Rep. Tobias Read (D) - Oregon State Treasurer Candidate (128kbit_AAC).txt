[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody, for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tobias Reed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Beaverton state representative,
and I hope not only to follow Ted Wheeler
[SPEAKER_00]: on stage, but into office as state
treasurer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Oregon is a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not the first state to legalize,
but we're still well ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that the decisions we make in
Oregon are going to be the ones that the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the country looks to when they
legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the state, legal cannabis
businesses are off to a really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: start, exceeding expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: $14 million in sales in January alone?
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't even count medicinal
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when extracts and edibles come online,
that is going to only increase the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because the federal government is
dragging its feet, it's leaving states
[SPEAKER_00]: like Oregon in a bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banks and credit unions can't confidently
extend their services to legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses without risking the violation
of federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine how dangerous and scary that
is for cannabis business owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps some of you are among them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep thousands of dollars in
cash on hand to meet payroll, to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes, and buy inventory and supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we haven't solved all our
problems, that's one of the reasons I
[SPEAKER_00]: helped to pass the cannabis banking bill
in Oregon in the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government still needs to act,
but we're one step closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: By removing criminal liability in Oregon
for the provision of banking services,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're helping to remove those duffel bags
of cash that are moving around our
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhoods and putting businesses and
neighborhoods at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got lots more to do, but this is an
important first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you'll all be with me as we
continue that effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you being here and wish you
great luck on a successful event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
