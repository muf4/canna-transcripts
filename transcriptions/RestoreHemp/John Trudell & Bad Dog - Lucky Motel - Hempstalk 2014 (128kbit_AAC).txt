[SPEAKER_00]: During times of shadow In the background a
burst The Sun waits for the moon To torch
[SPEAKER_00]: the night To torch the night In the broken

memories go To forget To forget Laughing
[SPEAKER_00]: to erase Her name is Lacey She makes it
crazy, kind of crazy His name is Want She
[SPEAKER_00]: can hear it She wants want But doesn't

Lightning Carries thunder She

They held them together So as not to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: so alone So alone During times of shadow
In the background a burst The Sun waits
[SPEAKER_00]: for the moon To torch the night To torch
the night In the breath of size In the
[SPEAKER_00]: magic of moon They held them together So
as not to feel so alone So alone So alone
So alone So alone So alone So alone So
alone
