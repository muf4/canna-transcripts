[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, thanks for coming this
afternoon to the State Capitol to rally
[SPEAKER_00]: about our efforts to continue to improve
on the reforms brought by Ballot Measure
[SPEAKER_00]: 91 and to help protect the Medical
Marijuana Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are changing very rapidly and I'm
not sure that we're all on the same page
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily and I'm not sure that my
information is the most current
[SPEAKER_00]: information but people should know that
what differentiates this lightning round
[SPEAKER_00]: short session from previous sessions is
that the legislature has been responsive
[SPEAKER_00]: to our concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in touch with the Health
Authority and the Health Authority has
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled back on some of the rules they were
going to impose on medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate co-chair at last week's meeting
announced that instead of March 1st as a
[SPEAKER_00]: date for grandfathering that it would be
May 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are seeing progress, we are seeing
improvement, we are seeing some good
[SPEAKER_00]: technical corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of us who have been coming here for
a while, I've been coming here since 1999,
[SPEAKER_00]: will remember that last session we left
the building thinking that as long as it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a private club and didn't have
employees there could be cannabis cafes
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when the Health Authority issued
rules that said that couldn't happen we
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted legislators and there's an
amendment to 1511 that's being proposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: amend the indoor clean air act to allow
for cannabis cafes thanks mostly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: good work of Harrison Conley, a former
legislative council who's been lobbying on
[SPEAKER_00]: behalf of the world famous cannabis cafe
in Madeline Martinez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little surprised to hear about
this rally since you know just because
[SPEAKER_00]: usually there's more kind of advance
notice it gives people an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in touch with their legislators or
legislators from what's now the Joint
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee on Legalizing Marijuana and I
just want to encourage you all to to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, to make those appointments and to
schedule times and to visit with people if
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's not likely you're going to
be able to see anybody today but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly come back while the legislature
is in session or in between sessions is an
[SPEAKER_00]: especially good time to catch up with
legislators and because part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is you know like I said I've been
coming here since 99 and back then you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Sandy Burbank was here, Laird Funk
sometimes John Sajo would come down from
[SPEAKER_00]: the mountain you know and me and the only
person in the building that was being paid
[SPEAKER_00]: to be here every day that was on our team
was the ACLU and it was like that more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less for a long time Madeline and others
were here in 2005 when we passed Senate
[SPEAKER_00]: bill was it 1805, 1705 whatever the number
was the bill that expanded the Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Act but last session suddenly
there was an explosion of lobbyists on our
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and they were lobbyists for the
industry for different portions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for individualized companies and
some for organization including the Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown Growers Guild and the Oregon
Cannabis Association but the problem is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there wasn't anybody here for the
consumers, for us and so I went and met
[SPEAKER_00]: with folks at Portland Normal and started
a legislative committee and Lindsey
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinhardt who's not here right this minute
is now the voice of consumers in this
[SPEAKER_00]: building so if you have issues that you
think are important to consumers that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want in front of legislators get that
information get that information to
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsey yeah I think I think that's that's
mostly it I think that that you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: important thing is I know that people get
together and rally when they're angry and
[SPEAKER_00]: upset and there's a sense of outrage but I
want folks to know that in the first place
[SPEAKER_00]: the legislature is being responsive but
the thing that you can really do the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can really do is many legislators
on the 91st Committee have a bad view of
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical marijuana program they've been
misled about the medical marijuana program
[SPEAKER_00]: they believe as a matter of fact that
overwhelmingly most of the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is cultivated is leaving the
state when that's not true they believe
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelmingly that anybody can get a card
and that most people in the program are
[SPEAKER_00]: scamming the system and they're going to
continue to believe that unless and until
[SPEAKER_00]: those of us who are honest participants in
the medical marijuana program make
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves available to legislators and
tell them the truth okay because you know
[SPEAKER_00]: these are again you know some of these
folks there's a guy on the panel who's
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with a guy who has MS they believe
in the medicinal value we've won that
[SPEAKER_00]: argument they don't think we're making
that stuff up but they are concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: about the abuses that have been publicized
and they are going to make reforms to
[SPEAKER_00]: change those and including the reforms
that they made already we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that stuff back but we can we can move
things forward if we present honestly who
[SPEAKER_00]: the patients are who the growers are
what's really going on so thanks again for
[SPEAKER_00]: coming and as always I'm around I'll be
available for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Leland Berger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lawyer in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I practice statewide with the Oregon
Cannabis and Compliance Council LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also chair of the Legislative
Committee for Portland Normal which meets
[SPEAKER_00]: on the first Monday of each month at 8 o
'clock at the Northwest Cannabis Cafe at
[SPEAKER_00]: 13th and Powell in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
