[SPEAKER_00]: The Reflectical!
[SPEAKER_00]: So read your times, love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love knows that we could use a little that
meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baby, it's breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a shame, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a shame to get you walking out my
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need you now.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't mind dying, Lord,
on any day that's yet to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have been just fine, Lord,
on any day that's come and gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jesus Christ, almighty, don't you take
my soul tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one more earthly cigarette and make
me feel all right tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, but with you, Lord, I could use a
brand new start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but don't you let me die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you let me die.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, don't you let me die with this broken
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and John,
where is everyone gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is everyone gone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me down by the old road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made me right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking on the west end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe it's freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So read your times, love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love knows that we could use a little that
meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby, it's freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a shame, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a shame to get you walking out my
door.
But I need you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is everyone gone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I said, Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
and John, where is everyone gone?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
