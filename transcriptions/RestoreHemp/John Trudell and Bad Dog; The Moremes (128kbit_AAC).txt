[SPEAKER_00]: There's me There's the other me There's
another me And then there are the more
[SPEAKER_00]: me's And we've all got a domino to play So
we've been trying to work it out We all
[SPEAKER_00]: know how your life went Or what all that
means But me and the me's We're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: back We've already seen what we couldn't
do Any skeletons in our closets Our own
[SPEAKER_00]: private stash of bones That scream with no
choice There's no scream like the next
[SPEAKER_00]: scream Reducing the present into nothing
While eternity is now, not then Who's
[SPEAKER_00]: divided?
[SPEAKER_00]: Into what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's love that loves There's love that
fears There's love that possesses There's
[SPEAKER_00]: love that needs proof Where's the love
that accepts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that likes Love that cares There's no
forgetting Some realities Destiny threw at
[SPEAKER_00]: us And fate wasn't much help With its way
of loading the load When we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any say In
[SPEAKER_00]: the land where the lie is king Using fear
like glue Pretending, pretending isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: pretending At least one of us have seen it
all Each and every one of us want the
[SPEAKER_00]: glory But none of us like the way we fall
Strain is a way of walking But staying
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't an option Because we've been accused
There's some things we did There's some
[SPEAKER_00]: things we didn't do And we heard,
I forgive yous, that lie Me and the me's
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for a me That will answer to
me So far, there's no one who will
Where are you?
