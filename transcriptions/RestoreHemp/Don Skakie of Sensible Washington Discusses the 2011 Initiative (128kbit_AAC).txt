[SPEAKER_02]: You're representing this new initiative
drive up in Washington State to basically
[SPEAKER_02]: remove all penalties from cannabis
possession and use, sales, transport,
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation, all the laws against
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the process you've got to go
through in Washington now?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the initiative process, we need to
get 251,153 valid signatures from voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason it's going to work is that
the language follows initiative 161 from
[SPEAKER_00]: 1923 in New York that ended prohibition
statewide 10 years before the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just doesn't conflict with federal
law because we don't create any regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: or any language at all that could be
preemptive federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just simply removes state
penalties, civil and criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people say, well, you know,
they change the laws all the time up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're really doing is we're
creating an opportunity for the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature to step up and listen to the
citizens of how they want cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated and taxed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what length of time do you have to
gather those signatures in?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to file our initiative in
January.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have our paper hit the street in
February.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have until June 30th.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a time period where you have
to clear things like through the state
[SPEAKER_04]: attorney general or through the whatever
department there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will file early January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have 14 days to research it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filed this already as initiative 1068.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, we grew as an organization and it
was all grassroots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any paid gatherers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some paid gatherers were out there working
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were out there using us for their own
benefit and didn't turn their signatures
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got over six thousand people this
year that have expressed an interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case and only half of
them step up and make a commitment,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that means we need a hundred people
each for us over a five-month period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, if everybody gets one
signature a day and only half the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that commit do it, we're on the balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have a five-month period you have
to get this in?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're shooting for 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that an initiative that's directly
to the people or is that an initiative to
[SPEAKER_02]: the legislature?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in Washington there is this other
process there that gives you a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: longer period of time to collect
signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does give you a year, but then the
legislature can also create a competing
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, the citizens say this,
but we say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really split the vote that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an initiative to the people,
you really give them the chance to say
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what we really want and the
numbers will show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The response from the public as time went
on and they became aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people didn't even know we were
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they found out we were out there,
it's like, where have you been?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to sign this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want it to pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people want to contact the campaign,
what's the best way for them to do so?
[SPEAKER_03]: SensibleWashington.org is our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now our website's in transition from
the bare bones that we have left over from
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on a really awesome new
website that's going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be directed at the undecided
voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know that our true believers
are going to support and vote for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the people that
absolutely will never support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sense spending any time on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to aim for the people in
the middle that are worried about their
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will this affect their children?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're worried about the economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the $150 million a year we save
from not arresting 14,000 people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington going to affect the economy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is having them back at work
instead of prison going to affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy?
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also cover hemp, industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're expecting that the $100 million
market that Washington imports to make
[SPEAKER_00]: products here can be grown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be green jobs here in
America, right here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
