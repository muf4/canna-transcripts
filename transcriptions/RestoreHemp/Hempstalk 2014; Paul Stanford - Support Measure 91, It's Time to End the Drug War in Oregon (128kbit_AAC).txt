[SPEAKER_00]: The message I want to get out is that
marijuana is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for it to be prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is good for us, it's good for
our bodies, it helps our health and
[SPEAKER_00]: longevity, it helps the health of our
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we stop using petrochemicals and
start using hemp for fuel, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the whole economic paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of our money going into the hands
of Exxon, Shell, the Saudi Sheiks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nigerian despots and their Swiss bank
accounts, the money will be going to our
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and into our communities and
realign our whole economic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: As my late great friend, Gatewood Gabre
said, the people who brought us marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition are the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: transnational, corporate, elite,
fascist sons of bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our job is to restore hemp, and that's
what this is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This event is about educating the public,
showing that we are not criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are good citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can follow whatever rules they want us
to follow, but we aren't going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to lock us all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to continue the lie that
marijuana is harmful, because it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the day when we can
openly use cannabis in this park,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like we do in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we followed these rules to show
that we can meet whatever requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: they throw at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they suck, and they do suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to pay these security guys 25
bucks an hour, each of the 40 of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be here 12 hours a day, and they're not
under our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're under the police's control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police do not want us to legalize
marijuana, because they want to keep their
[SPEAKER_00]: gravy train going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to continue getting those
corrupt dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to continue seizing our
marijuana and our marijuana garden so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can sell it on the black market and put it
into their pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to seize our property.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to seize our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to seize everything we've got,
and they don't give a shit about us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to tell them that marijuana is
a powerful tool that enables us to examine
[SPEAKER_00]: reality and see the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to tell us what reality is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to tell us that marijuana is a
bad thing, but it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will continue to educate them with
truth and with love, because we're good
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got nothing to be ashamed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to urge each and every one of
you to register and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote yes on Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much better bill than they have in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot better than what they have in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help us establish a new industry
here in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put Oregon on the cutting edge of exciting
new economic development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need you all to register to vote,
and get your family and friends to
[SPEAKER_00]: register to vote, and educate them that
this is a good bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nothing's perfect, but we can't
sacrifice the good to the perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to take this and vote in favor
of it, because it's going to help us open
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of new businesses and restore hemp
for fuel, fiber, and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you all for going
through the gauntlet that the City of
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, and mainly the Portland Police
Bureau and their executives, not the
[SPEAKER_00]: officers on the beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're our friends, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's those executives that depend on
the prohibition dollars that are making us
[SPEAKER_00]: go through these stringent requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be here, and we are going
to prevail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to restore hemp for fuel,
fiber, food, and medicine, and adult
[SPEAKER_00]: social use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all you folks for coming
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back here next year at the
Portland Waterfront, and hopefully we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: pass Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have adult smoking sections in the
park, and we will restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
