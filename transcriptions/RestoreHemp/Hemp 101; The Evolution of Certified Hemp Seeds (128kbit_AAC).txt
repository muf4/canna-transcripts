[SPEAKER_00]: There is a Canadian Seed Growing
Association, and they have been producing
[SPEAKER_00]: their own foundation seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been producing foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you normally have in seed
development is you have breeder seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have foundation seed, you have
registered seed and certified seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those four classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a four year period in the
evolution of any certified seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The National Seed Protection Act provides
the legal framework for handling the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics of seeds inside of the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's consistent with international
treaties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Canadian regulations that they're
operating by go far beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions of the Seed Variety
Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because under the Seed Protection Act,
a farmer can save seed enough to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: their own acreage of a tier one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many heirloom seeds that there
is no restriction on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot to learn about the nature of
those laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the rules I believe we're
going by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is going to be doing it its own
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is not Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we value our autonomy and our
independence greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've gotten advice from some of the
best minds in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very, very exciting time.
