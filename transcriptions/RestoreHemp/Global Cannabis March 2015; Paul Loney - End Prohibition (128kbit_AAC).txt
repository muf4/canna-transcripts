[SPEAKER_00]: All right, who here is in favor of
freedom?
[SPEAKER_00]: And who here likes to have a job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who here likes to have a place to live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who here likes to have healthcare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, so far we can't rest yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed Measure 91, but the rest of it
now we have to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to have your job, if you want
to have your house, if you want to go see
[SPEAKER_00]: a doctor, you know, you have to say stop
the discrimination against cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like end the discrimination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're all about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, why are we marching?
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to end discrimination,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way we're going to do it,
because right now, you know, your landlord
[SPEAKER_00]: could tell you no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're living in government housing,
they can tell you no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you smoke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They say not in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're trying to pass bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to pass bills that say you can't
even have a cannabis club, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out my shirt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, boo on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Nikki.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Nikki knows what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nikki's got a great club, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the other spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I got the great t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't miss those, nice and pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, oh, I see a black one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you know, they don't want us to
smoke anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying, hey, you know,
if you live in certain housing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't smoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your doctor tells you you can't smoke,
you can't smoke, because you've ordered
[SPEAKER_00]: for the doctor, you know, he says,
oh, I'm not going to treat you for X,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y, and Z if you're a marijuana consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that fair, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We vote for freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep working freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll call the folks in Salem and say,
this is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they're busy down there attacking
the Oregon medical marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to remind them we got to have
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have our rights to consume in a
club in private.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have our rights to have
housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't discriminate against it in
federally funded or state funded housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And jobs, you know, right now you can be
fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your employer says after July 1st,
I don't care what you do on the weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your employer says, hey,
if you smoke marijuana on the weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fired Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what we voted for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted to end prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't allow, you know,
it's not just to end public prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to end private prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are being discriminated
against because they're consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They choose us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're not going back in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laurie's not going back in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nikki's not going back in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going back in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody here is going back in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to tell your friends and
family, this is not over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, come July 1st, it's not over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what I said on the night
Measure 91 passed, that great night,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this is just the beginning,
just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we really have to push for our
freedoms because they want to push back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing already down in Salem,
you know, when the Oregon League of Cities
[SPEAKER_00]: and the counties are trying to say,
no, you can't have a dispensary there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're trying to say that if you
grow, if one little piece of aroma escapes
[SPEAKER_00]: your property, you can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't say that about
chicken farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next-door neighbor has chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell the chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it marijuana smell OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't, you know, this is not what
we're about here in America, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we don't hurt somebody else,
it should be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're a country was founded
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to believe that, folks,
and keep pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep pushing for your freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can't rest now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to prove ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I say, folks, every day I come
to my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it's hard right now
because we have to prove that our industry
[SPEAKER_00]: is a good industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to harm others,
and we're especially not going to harm
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a very good industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to go above and beyond,
let's say, the alcohol industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tobacco industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, why can't our college football
teams here in the state, Oregon State and
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, have official beer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make any sense at all,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the hurdles that we're
facing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, but not 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to keep that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see Scott give me the nod.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to end up, as Nikki knows and
Laurie knows, with my famous little
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want folks to repeat after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you have to say when an
officer comes to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
