[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Goodman, I first met when he was
part of the King County Bar Association
[SPEAKER_00]: working on drug policy issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, he's gone on to a higher
elected office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so welcome Roger Goodman, one of your
Seattle State Senators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Khalid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're elected, too, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Khalid, he's an elected official as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been working with the King
County Bar Association for almost a decade
[SPEAKER_01]: now, organizing lawyers and doctors and
other stuff shirts to give the
[SPEAKER_01]: professional voice to drug policy reform,
to give opinion leaders and policymakers
[SPEAKER_01]: some cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the voluntary committee of lawyers
that I direct is working nationally with
[SPEAKER_01]: bar associations and other professional
groups all across the country to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get lawyers, and particularly
lawyers, but professionals to speak up
[SPEAKER_01]: about drug policy and give some courage to
policymakers to take action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Philippe said, I'm also an elected
official and vice chair of the House
[SPEAKER_01]: Judiciary Committee here in the Washington
State Legislature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that capacity, I'm one of very few
lawyers in the legislature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my drug policy work in the legislature
is at the salad bar or in sort of rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't see my work in the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very quiet, very subtle, sort of
testing the waters, giving some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues some different ways to frame
the issue that this isn't about drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about fiscal responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about protecting our children
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about providing health care.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about cleaning up public spaces
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting close to a tipping point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my quiet work in the legislature is
working with the other suits, but my not
[SPEAKER_01]: so quiet work out in the professional
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're making more noise now because
we're clearly at a point where drug policy
[SPEAKER_01]: is not just a marginal issue anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really been mainstreamed,
and folks understand that it's a strategic
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my off-campus, off-the-capital campus
of my work involves getting those bar
[SPEAKER_01]: associations across the country,
such as Colorado, Wisconsin,
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts Bar Association just
released a report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two weeks ago, it's on the desk of every
Massachusetts state legislator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the title is, with a nice seal on it,
it says, The Failure of the War on Drugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: Charting a New Course for the
Commonwealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even have to open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, The Failure of the War on Drugs,
and it's on the desk of the state
[SPEAKER_01]: legislator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just sort of seeping into their
minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what we're doing is giving
legislators a sense that this is not an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue to be afraid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll make one more comment in that
vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first ran for office, my opponent
hit me hard on the drug policy issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was going to be selling drugs to
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be the state director of drug
dealing, all these sort of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my poll numbers went up afterward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One final note on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years later, I ran for re-election
against my esteemed colleague,
[SPEAKER_01]: Toby Nixon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please give Toby a hand, because he is
a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, my first election,
I was hit hard for wanting to sell drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: to kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was this evil guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years later, I run against an opponent
who agrees with us that we need to reform
[SPEAKER_01]: drug policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in public, Toby criticized me for not
being aggressive enough on drug policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a two-year period, we've come a long
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worthwhile mentioning, when I ran for
office, I had no trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the medical marijuana issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that I distributed medical
marijuana never became a political issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had more trouble convincing people to
vote green than to vote for a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana distributor, because I'm a Green
Party candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not a Green Party candidate.
I'm a Green Party candidate.
