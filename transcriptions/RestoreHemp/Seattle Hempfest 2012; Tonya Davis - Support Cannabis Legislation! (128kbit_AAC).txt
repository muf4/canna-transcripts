[SPEAKER_00]: I want to personally thank every one of
you for coming out today and yesterday and
[SPEAKER_00]: on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this taste of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get anywhere else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want y'all to appreciate that because
I'm from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't get this kind of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like going into a time war.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put my two cents in on something
and I'm and I'm risking my life here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure because it's such a passionate
debate and I and I don't mean that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys need to support anything that's
going to bring things forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I I know the patients aren't
happy with 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: But y'all can take out the bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something else to fight about
and fight for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can stop the caging up of
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: For making a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to have the cops that are
going to be going out there and are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be doing their thing and make and
breaking the law themselves by harassing
[SPEAKER_00]: the patients and the sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can do is go after those
police officers and try to protect our
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, understanding and compassion is
what this movement is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't say support or don't support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say vote your conscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't be so hard on the folks that
either support it or don't support it
[SPEAKER_00]: because we all have to be on the same
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Ohio had some very good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a our paraphernalia laws got
dropped down to a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: See in Ohio, we probably got one of the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least one of the top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, best marijuana laws in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed to have up to 99 grams and
it's $100 ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now if you have it in a baggie or you
have the papers to roll it, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pass go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, which was kind of backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our legislators stepped up to the
plate and they have lowered the penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same as marijuana use or possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've been an activist for over 10
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand up for patients and everyone
alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I started out and this was just
about Tanya.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's been so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the world now, you know,
but you don't know that when you first go
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last August, I found out that there's
nothing that our doctors can do for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out I've got massive calcium
deposits on my brain all over my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: These calcium deposits are on the very
important parts of your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to look forward to a stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to look forward to heart attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to look forward to dementia and also
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: This disease by my doctors telling me how
very sick I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually pissed me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my doc, I don't care what state
I'm in that I'm living in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's home, that's home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to run me out of my home
for making a choice to try to fight for my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's nothing that the doctors can do
for me and our government has patents on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our government has patents on cannabinoids
as antioxidants and neuroprotectants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't you think that puts me in a
pretty good position because you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to take me out like a
child.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a criminal record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not suffering from drug addiction and
I am not suffering from mental illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a fighting chance and don't make
me leave my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not leave my home, but I guarantee
you that they couldn't do anything more to
[SPEAKER_00]: me than what's already going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already in a prison of my own body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my doctors gave me a death
sentence and what I want to do with it is
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to fight as hard as I can until I
take my last breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deserve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just because my choice of
medicine is cannabis doesn't make me a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I'm not pying into the
lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need y'all help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grandmother and I'd really like to
try to protect what brain I've got left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm reaching out to the big dogs in
this movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reaching out to everyone that is
participating and taking the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about Tanya Davis when you think
about cash hide, you know, do searches on
[SPEAKER_00]: both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Facebook account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me at Tanya Davis is at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be around all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm staying at the Edgewater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come, come talk to me if you want to talk
to me, you know, I'll answer any questions
[SPEAKER_00]: you have while I'm still in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, be good to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in this for the same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just all trying to get there
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
