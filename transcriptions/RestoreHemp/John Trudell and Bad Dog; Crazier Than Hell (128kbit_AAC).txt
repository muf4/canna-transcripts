[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling crazier than hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got this time on my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got you on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got nowhere else to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fires burn hot and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's someplace in between the melt and
the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: This need for reaching for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were all I could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm here, wearing alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm a ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Falling from my place in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dizzy is out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world keeps spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a vibrating echoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounded a lot like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst the truths I sought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were the one I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm needing the remembering close of
memories of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remembrances of laughter singing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Songing the nights with belonging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetnessing the shelter of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reality, the reality of safe feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got nowhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these times of missing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never not going to love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days without you to hold my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling crazier than hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This crazy just goes on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this confusion of me's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy together or crazy apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: When crazy is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always in our heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's in our hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling crazier than hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got this time on my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got you in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got nowhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
