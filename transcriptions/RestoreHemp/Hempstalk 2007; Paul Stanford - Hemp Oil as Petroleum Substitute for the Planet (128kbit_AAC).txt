[SPEAKER_00]: So, come about 1910, this guy named
Schlittekin, according to research by Don
[SPEAKER_00]: Werchhafter, started inventing a machine
that was like the cotton gin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dropped the labor involved in HIP to a
hundred-fold from its previous price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went from, I think, 50 cents a pound to
half a cent a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And HIP became incredibly inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happened, the petrochemical
industry was just starting to synthesize
[SPEAKER_00]: petroleum to be like hemp seed oil and
other vegetable oils to run diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: engines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, at that time, petroleum wasn't the
predominant fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people grew their fuels, their
illuminates, they called it, for their
[SPEAKER_00]: lamps before electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd eat the stuff left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with HIP, they called it gruel,
which was a pretty basic food that was
[SPEAKER_00]: very high in the essential fatty acids
just like it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very healthy food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the petrochemical industries realized
that HIP was their main competitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That HIP produced three times more seed
oil than any other plant out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's still true today.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to a study out of Notre Dame
that was published in a magazine called
[SPEAKER_00]: The Midlands Naturalist back in 1975,
this article is called Feral Hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to that study, the wild hemp
that was growing on the riverside in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Illinois produced four tons of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take four tons of seed and you
press it, you get 300 gallons of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that oil is not only very nutritious,
it can also be put right into any diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with no conversion to the diesel
engine, it can run your diesel engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other seed oil crops right now
are soybeans, sunflower seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and canola, or rapeseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rapeseed, and then when they press
it, they call it canola oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of those produce 100 to 120 gallons
of oil per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's mainly what we're driving today
when we're driving biodiesel vehicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're driving those seed oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it runs the diesel engines just fine,
as most of us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But HIP is three times more productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the byproduct for making oil from HIP
is three tons of high protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with four tons of HIP seeds,
you press it, you get 300 gallons of oil
[SPEAKER_00]: and four tons of high protein HIP seed
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not the only thing you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just with that alone, though, if we grew
all of our fuel from HIP, all those
[SPEAKER_00]: barrels of oil, for every barrel of oil,
there's 50 gallons, there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: half a ton of high protein HIP seed meal
left over to wipe out world hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another byproduct,
the fiber byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get about 25 tons of HIP
herd fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: HIP herds also make paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bulletin from the USDA back in
1916, USDA bulletin 404 by Lester Dewey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called HIP herds is a paper making
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that report said that HIP produces
four times more paper per acre than trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a waste product when you're
growing HIP for seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that waste product can make most of
our paper needs and our building
[SPEAKER_00]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can glue that stuff together the same
way they glue together wood fibers today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other byproduct, not just is
the herd fiber, but also six to eight tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of bast fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the highest quality plant fiber you
can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to make canvas, rope,
lace, and linen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, a lot of the antique linens
and laces out there are made from
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana stems, from HIP fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your average acre of HIP is going
to produce 300 gallons of oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: three tons of high protein HIP seed meal,
25 tons of HIP bast fiber for paper and
[SPEAKER_00]: building material, and six to 10 tons of
HIP herd fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the herd fiber is the 25 tons and
the bast fiber is the six to 10 tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bast fiber can be used to make
canvas, rope, lace, and linen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's the seed oil that's the
real key here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that when we legalize marijuana and
allow unregulated industrial HIP to become
[SPEAKER_00]: predominant again, the petrochemical
industries are going to lose their market
[SPEAKER_00]: hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see a decentralization of
the economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to see the money being
sent to the sheiks and the oil companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the despotic governments around the world
that depend on it in Nigeria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Middle East.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see the money going to the
farmers and to the local economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the petrochemical industry
does not want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want us to keep pouring our money
into their industries that are capital
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive, take so much money to drill for
oil, none of us can compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes billions of dollars,
tens of billions to refine petroleum into
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different products we use to make
from it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But HIP seed oil and HIP, you get a seed
oil press for $2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any farmer can get all the oil he
needs to run his tractors, feed his
[SPEAKER_00]: family, and ship the rest to support the
local energy market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to the day when that's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are really here working for today
is to end adult marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to end adult marijuana
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make it legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see it where it's legally sold
to adults over the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see it where adults can grow
their own with no license whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't need a license to make
your own beer or wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only when you start selling it that
you need a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to see unlicensed personal
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see unregulated hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you look at the industrial hemp
market out there, and in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe, they're limited to less than 1%
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, half of a percent THC in
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do, and that's why the
petrochemical industries really allow that
[SPEAKER_00]: and support it, because what they do is
they breed out the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by breeding out the THC, they breed
out the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: By breeding out the flowers, they're
breeding out the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the food and the protein that
hemp should be making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we restore it to its natural
place, we're going to see a boom for all
[SPEAKER_00]: of our farmers, for all our local
economies, and the decentralization of
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth as it should be, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the dream, and that's what we're
working for, to restore industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and to help medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, we've got our
clinics, and they've done a lot to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: get this thing going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I look forward to the day when our
clinics are put out of business by legal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and unregulated industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're working for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working to make it where our clinics
basically don't have a job anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people can grow their own without
a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be a happy day, and we're
going to keep working toward it.
