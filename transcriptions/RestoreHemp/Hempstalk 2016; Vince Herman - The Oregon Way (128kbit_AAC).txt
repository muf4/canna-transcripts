[SPEAKER_00]: Folks, everything has been so smooth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many great speakers saying so many good
things, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday afternoon sitting by that river in
the sun, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday morning, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few more weeks are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That winter comes along, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to grab the sun while it shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going down to the river, relax my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Singing, hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Portland way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the medicine on the river
bank today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, hey, let the river flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good things coming on everywhere that you
go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, Washington, California,
it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a good little Oregon freedom
going in this day, it's true, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think you're feeling all right,
if we can keep it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overregulate it, you can overtax
it, and I think that's a good mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, hey, that's the Oregon way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel so good singing about it,
being by the river today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say, hey, festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it up in the sundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody give it a roll, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people coming to speak and giving
wisdom all around the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawyers, doctors, engineers, farmers,
and people that sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it on, we need more, this freedom
win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sing it with me now when the coins
come around again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, hey, this is the Oregon way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that sunshine on the green fields with
the river play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, hey, oh, headstock festival 2016,
yeah, living in the city of dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a bird on it, people might think
it's from Portland town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you got that Portlandian thing,
everybody's looking all around,
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, I think the Oregon could be more
like this in that Portland way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got food trucks out in Alabama.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I heard them say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say, hey, it's a sweet Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that old Columbia River flowing,
flowing, flowing away, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headstock festival, we're going to get a
little rhythm to that Oregon rhythm song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headstock 2016, roll the faddy now and let
it all roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll the faddy now and let it all roll.
Roll the faddy now and let it all roll.
