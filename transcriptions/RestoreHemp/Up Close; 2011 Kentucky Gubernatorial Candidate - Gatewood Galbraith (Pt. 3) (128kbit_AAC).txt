[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in the early 90s after you
met Willie Nelson, I was honored to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: call from you and say, Willie Nelson's
going to contact you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could hardly believe it actually
when you called and told me that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, less than a couple weeks
later, that really happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then about three weeks after that,
I flew there to Lexington and starting at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hyatt Regency, right next to,
is it Rupp Auditorium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rupp Arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rupp Arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took off in your red Mercedes-Benz
station wagon and drove in a Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiesel car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you tell our audience a little bit
how that came about and how you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: first taught Willie Nelson, who's now a
big proponent of biodiesel, about Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiesel?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd always heard that Rudolph Diesel had
manufactured his diesel engine run off
[SPEAKER_01]: seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really didn't understand quite grasp
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in the early 90s, late 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a fellow from Nevada,
Las Vegas, Nevada, came through town
[SPEAKER_01]: driving a little Volkswagen diesel and he
was running it off Burger King oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had just derived some hemp oil
out of hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp seeds are 30 to 40 percent oil by
weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got 100 pounds of hemp seeds,
you can drive 30 to 40 pounds of pure oil
[SPEAKER_01]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had some of that and he tested
it out in his engine and he said this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the best seed oil that I've ever driven
this car on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Willie came in to do a benefit
concert for me, we poured that hemp oil
[SPEAKER_01]: into my Mercedes diesel and drove it about
110 miles across Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the first time in, I guess,
50 to 60 years that any vehicle had ever
[SPEAKER_01]: been driven on hemp oil on the United
States roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Willie told me later on, 12 years
later actually, no, I mean about 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: later, he says, Gatewood, he says that
afternoon we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It taught me what it was all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reason I started my biofuel
company was from what we learned that
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon driving your Mercedes across
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were also smoking about the biggest
hood or probably road in Kentucky at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a caravan of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from the Hyatt there and Rupp
Auditorium through Frankfurt, the state
[SPEAKER_00]: capital, which is about 80 miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then altogether 120 miles all the way
into Louisville, which is the largest city
[SPEAKER_00]: in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he did a big benefit concert for
you there that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a real honor to participate
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know CNN had their environmental
show Earth Watch and they covered that
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty intensely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're running for governor again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were elected, what are the top
three action items that you would enact as
[SPEAKER_00]: governor?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Kentucky is a dysfunctional
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've not been able to pass a balanced
budget in four out of the last seven
[SPEAKER_01]: sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had to go to special sessions and
advanced sessions to get the actual budget
[SPEAKER_01]: passed because neither party can produce a
candidate can disengagement partnership on
[SPEAKER_01]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all very vicious and
vituperative and people are getting turned
[SPEAKER_01]: off with all the negative ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've got to do first and
foremost is to restore a sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: integrity and honesty and even handedness
in the process itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could come up with all kinds of
hypothetical programs that we could apply
[SPEAKER_01]: and let people have access to,
but it would get shredded by the policies
[SPEAKER_01]: of fear and retribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to return integrity and trust
in the process itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the state of Kentucky is very poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're among the third or fourth poorest
state in the union.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 23 counties of Appalachia,
which are the poorest regions of the union
[SPEAKER_01]: of the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to get people interested in the
process again because nobody wants
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so dirty and mean and
despicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've run before where I said, I believe
all my opponents are honorable men and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're saying about each other is
true, which makes them all unfit for
[SPEAKER_01]: office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing is to try to restore
that integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way we do that is by giving
everybody a chance to do right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot oppose these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't overpower them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to control them into doing what
they believe is right for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kentucky's dynamics, for 40 years,
the Democrats ruled everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Republicans didn't have the House,
didn't have the Senate, and didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the governor's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 40 years, the Democrats ruled over the
Republicans and treated them like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so 10 years ago, the Republicans took
over the Senate and they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: practicing the politics of retribution for
the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been treating the Democrats
like they got treated for those 40 years
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Democrats don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're screaming like scalded dogs,
but they did it to the Republicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's been one fellow who's doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's called the bully, the leader of the
Senate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is a bully and he can be other than
charming on many occasions, but he's just
[SPEAKER_01]: given the Democrats what it is they gave
the Republicans all that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm telling the people of the
state of Kentucky, look, it's time to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: practicing the politics of retribution and
get into practicing the politics of
[SPEAKER_01]: achievement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can no longer be retributive because
it's killing the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're absolutely desperate for cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I believe that my plan to
immediately start planting hemp as a gas
[SPEAKER_01]: crop next spring, within two months after
I take over the office of the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky, my first act I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take the military helicopters out
[SPEAKER_01]: from going over the fields and gardens of
the people of the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is America, not Afghanistan,
and we're not an occupied territory and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna treat our citizens like we
are one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take the Army and the National
Guard out of police activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're no longer going to be assisting
state police.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those helicopters are gonna be used for
emergency medical and disaster relief
[SPEAKER_01]: only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to revolutionize the
relationship between the police and the
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no longer gonna be an us versus
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no longer gonna be an us versus
them kind of attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna be we, and there's gonna be
respect given.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't come in here and mess up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't come in here and confuse our
civility and statesmanship with being weak
[SPEAKER_01]: on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're gonna start treating people as
sovereign human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get marijuana into the
hands of the sick and dying folks
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately, as soon as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna try to set up a even-handed
tax regulatory system on it so we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: some new tax money in instead of taxing,
you know, instead of putting more taxes on
[SPEAKER_01]: the wage earner here in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's face it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just took the profits of the drug
lords and put them into our educational
[SPEAKER_01]: system, it'd be sobbed overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saw a bust of a drug lord down in Mexico
the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had $12 billion stacked, stacked in a
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: $12 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's the budget of Kentucky for two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had it stacked there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we could do with education,
what we could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I want to do is I'd really
like to sue the pharmaceutical companies
[SPEAKER_01]: and make them come up with hundreds of
millions of dollars in drug treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: programs for the problems that they're
solving with their pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
