I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanna tell y'all a little bit about a
plant I know that can save the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows long and tall and has flowers
that can make your mind swirl.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a funky plant with a fiber that is
resistant to rain and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the strongest plant by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fiber known to man, the best rope you'll
ever hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the pioneers covered up the wagon
trains with a canvas made of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Washington and Jefferson, they glued
on their phones and said they'd make the
[SPEAKER_01]: most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first stars and stripes were sewn on
him, the first constitution too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used around the world for food,
fiber, oil, medicine, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we break the seats, we won't have
no need for any of the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make paints and inks, or run our
cars going back next week, and it'll fix
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to see we can put in a mouth with
omega-6 and 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can feed the world with a tree of life
and live sustainably.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll grow fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't make our paper grow the house
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to spend growing wild and free,
living the way that we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonna leave my children a better world
than my ancestors left me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, whoa.
Flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the female hemp plant, make the best
medicines on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps cancer and AIDS patients eat their
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps those with depression overcome the
blues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call for epilepsy, nausea,
insomnia, stress, neurosis, psychosis,
[SPEAKER_01]: pink PMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the studies have been done,
and all the doctors agree, but they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: make money off this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, because it's free, it grows from
a seed of wild and free life we ought to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the future is grown in our own
backyards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll grow fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't make our paper grow the house
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to spend growing wild and free,
living the way that we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonna leave my children a better world
than my ancestors left me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this modern day and age,
when we seem to lack spirituality,
[SPEAKER_01]: this one single plant can bring us back
10,000 years in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the Shiva, Puranas, to Jesus,
to Christ, to the Buddha, the pagans,
[SPEAKER_01]: the goddess, the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: To commune with all the animals,
be one with all the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: To realize the God of Zeke is inside me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the Earth is among us, we've got to
take care of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Earth is the brother that gives life
birth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can be on touching with a single
green plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can start right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grow fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't make our paper grow the house
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to spend growing wild and free,
living the way that we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna leave my children a better world
than my ancestors left me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la.
Whoa, whoa.
