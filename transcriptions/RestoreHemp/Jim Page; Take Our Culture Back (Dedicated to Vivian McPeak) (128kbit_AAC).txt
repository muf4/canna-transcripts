[SPEAKER_00]: This song is for Vivian McPeak,
who may or may not be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna be here some time or other.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was here yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be here, to come all the way
down from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: On I-5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a long ass drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down to Olympia, Tacoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centralia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You finally hit Vancouver, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the river right in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that big bridge, that big sign that
says, welcome to Hempstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an arrow pointing over to the right,
which is actually the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the monkey off of your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now we've been here for a million
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music filling up the people's ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always sang our own song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the music business came along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ain't about to just tag along behind
somebody with a bankroll hanging out,
[SPEAKER_00]: telling me what I can sing about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the monkey off of your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollywood spectacle and promenade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of all that money just waiting to be
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you got to do is go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be sitting up pretty on gangsters
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it ain't smart to be misled by some
beavers and bloodhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have your hips Seattle slacker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me a good computer hack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: WikiLeaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the government off your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get inside to break it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be outside to know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two heads and a million eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can cut this thing right down to
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now culture is a weaponry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all our great humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And survival is a counter attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take our culture back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the monkey off of your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take our culture back.
