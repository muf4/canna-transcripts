[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Eric Llewellyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm part of the CRRH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also am a board member for Parents for
Pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a patient, and that's what I'm
here fighting for, is the patient accent
[SPEAKER_00]: of this all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Us as patients, we can't always get out in
life and do the things that we need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: without certain medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people rely on this medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without it, people can't live their lives,
go out, raise their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck, I couldn't be here right now if it
weren't for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all fought for the right to have it as
a medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to continue to fight to keep
it medical and help with those that can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get out to grow it, obtain it,
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even smoking, like my fellow partner Nikki
says, people need a place to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're taking those places from
us, where are we going to be able to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: safely?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to obtain our medicine to
maintain life?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just basically saying that we need to
continue to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop the fight because we've
legalized it for recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one step we tried to accomplish,
we accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they need to stick to what they
said and not touch our medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming out today.
