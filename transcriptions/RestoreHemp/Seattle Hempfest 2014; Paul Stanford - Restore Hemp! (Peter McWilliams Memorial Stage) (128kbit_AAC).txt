[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think marijuana is God's
greatest gift to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, you know, it could save our
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine, John Trindell,
says hemp is earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's efficient for our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps us achieve homeostasis where our
body systems are aligned and it produces
[SPEAKER_00]: more fuel, more fiber, more food than any
other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this planet, you know, the law here
isn't good enough yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vote for I-502 is a big step forward,
but we need to restore hemp and let people
[SPEAKER_00]: grow their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the current law doesn't
allow you to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taxes are too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana grows on trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally grow 12 foot tall marijuana
trees in Oregon and I give it away for
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I give it to sick and dying
patients and I've been doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it America's most public marijuana
garden, but I do it all organically and it
[SPEAKER_00]: saved many people's lives, but it's not
just about the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, humans began cultivating
marijuana before history, in prehistoric
[SPEAKER_00]: times, and all archaeologists agree that
marijuana, hemp, could be the oldest crop
[SPEAKER_00]: purposely grown by humans, perhaps as much
as 35,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the basis of the foundation of
agriculture and that means the foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: of civilization itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it produces more fuel, over 300 gallons
an acre, what they find from feral hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: fields in Illinois, more food,
6,000 pounds of hemp seed meals left over
[SPEAKER_00]: after they press the oil out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More fiber, 30 to 40 tons of fiber for
canvas, rope, lace, linen, paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: and building materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more medicine for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leaves go back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root draws up subsoil nutrients and
makes them available in the next crop
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when we burn hemp fuel,
it's carbon negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking carbon out of the atmosphere
to make it into fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp can really change our whole
economic paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are able to grow hemp without
regard to its THC content, but with regard
[SPEAKER_00]: to the varieties that produce the most
seed oil, seed protein, and stalks and
[SPEAKER_00]: stems for fiber, it'll change the whole
economic paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of giving our money to Exxon and
Mobil and the Saudi sheiks and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nigerian despots, and the Swiss bank
accounts, it'll go to our farmers and into
[SPEAKER_00]: our pockets and in our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, marijuana prohibition was never
about drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana prohibition and drugs is a
smokescreen, pardon the pun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But marijuana prohibition has always been
about money, power, and the continued
[SPEAKER_00]: centralization of economic and political
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, in marijuana prohibition,
and allow farmers to grow hemp for fuel,
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber, food, and medicine, will change the
whole economic paradigm and take the money
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the hands of the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: transnational, corporate, elite,
fascist sons of bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll put it in our pockets instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get active politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't settle for what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work to make this world a better place.
Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go from here and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day.
