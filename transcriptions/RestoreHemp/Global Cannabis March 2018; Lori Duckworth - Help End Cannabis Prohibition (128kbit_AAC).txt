[SPEAKER_00]: And what Raf said is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about getting people out of cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was almost one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat in a cage for seven days after my
facility was raided in Medford on May 23,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the former executive director of
Southern Oregon Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My facility operated for almost five years
next to the federal courthouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was raided along with my husband at the
time on a Thursday before Memorial Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's what we heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year later when we were due to go to
trial, we had some really fine attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard Leland Berger speak here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He represented my husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin Rosas was my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a plea bargain and all of the 29
and 28 felonies were dropped against
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and my husband in exchange for one
Class B felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: The charge was delivery of more than one
ounce of cannabis to another medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card holder for no
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no such charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a made up charge to get those
felonies to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward to three years, mine is
felonies been expunged as part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plea bargain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guns and ammunition were returned and
that was also a first in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continued to lobby with Compassionate
Oregon and you've heard Anthony Taylor and
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple other people talk about that
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in now, the five years since that
happened, we've done things like qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD as a qualifying condition and we
didn't just do that for our veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that for people like myself who
suffered from childhood traumas.
[SPEAKER_00]: For women who've been raped, that's a
trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: For children that have been beat,
sexually molested, women who have lived
[SPEAKER_00]: with domestic violence, all of those are
PTSD and you all now qualify under the
[SPEAKER_00]: OMMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you receive Oregon Health Plan or food
stamps, you now only pay $50 and $60
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassionate Oregon did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And veterans, you only pay $20 for your
application fee instead of $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the program to stick around,
you want to keep your medical program,
[SPEAKER_00]: you better keep your patient card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You medical growers, you better keep your
medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better convince some of those wreck
growers to get back on this side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because without a medical program and
people registered, that patient program's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard them talk about that little
golden box on my table over there at Delta
[SPEAKER_00]: 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please, I'm begging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop your coins in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop your dollar bills in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be circulating throughout the crowd
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what the DAP market is,
you'll see it there on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, talk to me about it
privately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need your medical card signed,
you talk to Paul Stanford or myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a clinic or two to refer you to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the owner of Jim Strong Medical
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the owner of Jim Strong Medical
Consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is dedicated to two of my
mentors, Jim Greig and Jim Clark,
[SPEAKER_00]: who are no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, to me, they represent what the
Oregon Medical Marijuana Program should be
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow is Jim's birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that box.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lobbyist, Anthony Taylor, is one of the
hardest working men in Salem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is there to fight for the patients
in the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask all of you to fight for this
life plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been cancer free for 15 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask all of you, talk to somebody every
day about this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it will change your life like it
changed mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a great March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a great March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a great March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
