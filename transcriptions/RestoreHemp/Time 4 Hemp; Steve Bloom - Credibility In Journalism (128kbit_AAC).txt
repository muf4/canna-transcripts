[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the program we were lucky enough to
have a very interesting guest and one who
[SPEAKER_01]: has been a leader in the hemp movement for
a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the news director, news editor of
High Times Magazine, Steve Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve, thank you for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your voice in the movement has been heard
for a long time and High Times Magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: has had a direction on bringing
information about the hemp plant and the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp movement to the public in any aspect
that they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, you've also had to deal
with some problems over the past few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to talk about all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the voice that you've put
together, High Times Magazine,
[SPEAKER_01]: how did that all come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're based in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a fairly small operation magazine
publishing company that publishes High
[SPEAKER_00]: Times as well as a couple of other
magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn out a magazine every month like
everybody else does in our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're no different than most people when
it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our job to write headlines,
to assign, to bring in photos,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do all the legwork that it takes to get
the whole magazine produced from beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all professionals at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, we're also advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes it unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that you are advocates and you're
out there with your neck on the line,
[SPEAKER_01]: being willing to put your face and your
time and talent out there for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: see and enjoy and learn from has also
caused you some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New Orleans, you were subpoenaed into
court and a problem came up that many
[SPEAKER_01]: people know about but not in full detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've documented it in High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been documented by the mainstream
press, as we like to sort of call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington Post, Wall Street Journal,
USA Today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've looked into our situation and what
was going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The situation pretty much was through a
campaign to gut the indoor growing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They targeted High Times as well as the
main information vehicle that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading this news about growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to snuff out the industry and
get rid of High Times at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also targeted a magazine called
Cincinnati Tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Targeting meant that they started Grand
Jury.
[SPEAKER_00]: They indicted the president of a company
called the Seed Bank out of that Grand
[SPEAKER_00]: Jury.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted information from High Times
regarding possible criminal conspiracy,
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting us with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, of course, are connected in a business
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: He advertises through High Times,
but they seem to think it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger and vaster than that, that we're in
the midst of some sort of major
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine activities to distribute
marijuana all over the world or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a magazine that talks about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times being established is what many
people say the Bible of the movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were there before anybody else was,
it seems like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were reporting and covering stories
that people wouldn't pick up and cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: With you being out there and bringing that
information home, that makes you an easy
[SPEAKER_01]: target.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you protect yourself now?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about getting advertisers?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about raising funds to keep
the magazine going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not fundraising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in a magazine, people buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one major source of revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times has good sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank all our dedicated, loyal readers.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times is hard to get sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always tell us that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the country, we get questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can I get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: People drive miles out of the way to get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spirited by those stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm told that in some parts of America,
it's illegal for them to have the magazine
[SPEAKER_00]: in their stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the absurdity of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be told that by somebody in some
locality, and they'll believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll get these calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times out of business or High Times
is... Not lately, but we have in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember one real recently,
but we just generally get that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just all this disinformation that
got spread around about High Times that
[SPEAKER_00]: the DA, our arch enemy, likes to
constantly spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just send it out into the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets picked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets spread around in stories and wire
service stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you know it, it's just sprinkled
into the consciousness of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: so-and-so has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I've traveled across seas,
I've been to Amsterdam and Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been lucky enough to be a few places,
courtesy of the United States Army.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the chance to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was across seas, I noticed that
your magazine is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your magazine's in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your magazine's in England.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your magazine's in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your magazine's all across the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: False.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Illegal in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal in Canada, but it can,
maybe through mail, whatever people are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are reaching an international
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, you focus on the world scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some changes in the laws
regarding hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some people in, I think,
Australia who are trying to bring hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: into a cash crop situation and to help
feed the people down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you focus on the world scene,
what directions do you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, I don't know very much about it
other than a proposal to the government
[SPEAKER_00]: there for a hemp project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focus on a lot of the aspects of where
hemp comes from around the world at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're unearthing it at the same time all
the activists are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all working at a feverish pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The activists and the entrepreneurs,
I must add, there's money out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are trying to make it as well as
spread the gospel about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing an excellent job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be talking more with Steve Bloom
right after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actively seeking new advertisers
and you're also repositioning the magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: and putting it into a different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The base of advertisers that the
government scared off through the
[SPEAKER_00]: harassment of Operation Green Merchant,
we've had to look elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, as I said before,
the readers have been able to carry the
[SPEAKER_00]: load and very devoted and keep us afloat,
but we need more advertising to really run
[SPEAKER_00]: a better operation overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been just looking out to more
obvious markets, the entertainment world,
[SPEAKER_00]: record companies, film companies,
book companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very reticent, but that's our
little test each time we make a
[SPEAKER_00]: breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I should show advertising,
but this is an advertisement from Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: Records who said that they would not
advertise in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, we were told because of our
support of normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow or other, this group persuaded
them to have the advertisement because
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wall broke down very quickly for some
strange reason and it's a good wall for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping there will be more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, out in the community, people have
been afraid to touch us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the years, your content of your
magazine has gotten stronger and has
[SPEAKER_01]: become more focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you've even been responsible for
breaking news, bringing new information to
[SPEAKER_01]: light that rattles the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main claim to fame in recent history
is all hemp information that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: uncovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a big story on JFK recently that
will become a major motion picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movie's coming out about JFK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of information, we jump on the
stuff that's not told.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we see ourselves as the
alternative press at this point because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are so many angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it may be a little too heavy on
the conspiracy side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to rule a few out in editorial
meetings, but the hemp information is a
[SPEAKER_00]: grand conspiracy theory when you really
dig into it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's ultimately really fascinated
us that it's so deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've also been attributed, or your
magazine has been attributed, to help to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring a focus to the hemp movement like an
umbrella where people can all get to know
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and interact.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you continue to grow, how do you plan
to incorporate that particular attitude?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to start advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to tell them through this
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were hoping to create a hemp industry,
in a sense, that will benefit us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the previous companies who are
no longer advertising, although there are
[SPEAKER_00]: a few, the lighting systems and stuff like
that, the grow companies, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: garden stores and so on, they have come
back in drips and drabs, but we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: look elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole hemp industry that's
waiting to really blossom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it here in this building
downstairs, the whole row of people with
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, the hemp merchants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing to watch how it is
expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is money in it, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to make money from it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help fund the movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more money here in this whole
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, it'll get spread around in the
right ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a few entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people think of High Times magazine,
they think of it sometimes as strictly a
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more to it than that now,
isn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We really are the only marijuana magazine,
so we'll still... I don't mind that banner
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of changing the terminology somewhat
to hemp or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that, voice of the counterculture,
we have a little slogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask, what's the counterculture or
is there a counterculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: We think there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've uncovered that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to know about hemp tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a countercultural movement of
people doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets local coverage, but it doesn't get
any national.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd rather report in the New York Times
a few weeks ago that there's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: decline in marijuana use and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to acknowledge that
there's a whole rise in a movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who think that it should be
legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't indicate decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to recognize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a counterculture of people out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not as huge as it was in the
60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make as good pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crowds aren't big enough for it or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still making a change in people's
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've occasionally picked up the banner
in somebody's world who's been arrested or
[SPEAKER_01]: been treated unjustly.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the power of the press, shall we say,
you've corrected an injustice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to discuss a couple of those
stories when we come back after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here today with High Times editor
Steve Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve, as we said earlier, the power of
the press can make a difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: personal lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you, on a personal example,
have shown, by personal example,
[SPEAKER_01]: how that can be achieved and some of the
things that you've done, and then you've
[SPEAKER_01]: written about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was one situation where I was
arrested last year in New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it really put the drug war right in my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get so much information to High Times
from people who are arrested all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's detached from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality of it happening, well,
what happened to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened in brief is I was driving at
night in New Jersey speeding, and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled over for a speeding violation,
and that just wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was driving a car that they presumed
guilty, an old Firebird, 70s kind of car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fits some sort of profile, I'm told.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just coming back from a dead show,
so I looked apart, but once he sized me
[SPEAKER_00]: up, I was like, we're getting this guy out
of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, I had been stopped one other
time in New Jersey within that year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I was like, oh no, here we go
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same damn car, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't had the car very long either,
just the way that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great car, but for some reason
they hated it in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought me out of the car and
proceeded to search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it happened the previous time as
well, I knew they were going to the patch
[SPEAKER_00]: search.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pat you down, which really is a major
violation right there, but they're allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, why are they taking me out
of the car?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, why did that even start as a
necessity?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the change in life from my time
when I was younger first learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: drive and maybe having a speeding
violation, and you get your ticket,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to now, this whole hysterical
response to a simple traffic violation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you get out of the car with an app
being told to, they'll put a gun to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: My story is not as bad as a lot of others,
I'm sure you can hear, but they did take
[SPEAKER_00]: me out of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found a pipe in my pouch,
and I was arrested for the pipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply for the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No quantity of anything other than what
was called less than 50 grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they tested the pipe to find little
flakes of trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, I'm arrested, handcuffed,
fingerprinted, the whole fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cuffed, fingerprinted, arrested,
taken to the station house, the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all for a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was let out in about an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the worst experience of my life,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't hit me, they didn't do
anything, they didn't beat me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing happened terrible like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sort of a state of unreality when I
went back to my car and I just drove home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got arrested.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of my own recognizance and now I
have to do the whole court thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a lawyer, a friend of mine who's
a New Jersey lawyer, and she decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: take the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a corporate lawyer who really didn't
have the time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a real great hero to me,
having taken this case pro bono.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found some interesting precedents and
used it to overturn the search.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost in the first round and we won in
the second round on the state level going
[SPEAKER_00]: to Trenton.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get through one round because it
was a small town that just no way they
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to slap the cops' wrists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had to get out of that town and go
to the state house where they didn't care
[SPEAKER_00]: about that little town's concerns,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a cool judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the judge suite of Trenton or
something who really heard our story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state didn't really try to defend
themselves very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought, oh, they'll just ... They
came with a real lame approach to not even
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to sell that I was really guilty of
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did this to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved my hand like this to get my wallet
to my pouch and he thought I was going for
[SPEAKER_00]: a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all this ... You know from
firsthand experience ... They'll make up
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hemp Tor people have told me well and
I've learned you can't drive around
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore with anything wrong with your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything will pick you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the police state stuff that we're
dealing with that's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people realize that on a
day-to-day level, an average citizen now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really scary to see it being
how they realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the hysterical people who are
in favor of the drug war, who are of the
[SPEAKER_00]: few, but they bark loudest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people still, I think, are opposed to
that kind of encroachment on their
[SPEAKER_00]: freedoms, the average American citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes out of drug-related
behavior, which people think is no big
[SPEAKER_00]: deal in the first place, a lot of average
Americans, and then they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped on top of it, they're getting
really incensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's costing them money, obviously,
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crimping their whole financial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be any number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My case is such a small little situation,
but it did teach me how you have to fight
[SPEAKER_00]: back and what it cost to fight back.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lawyer said it would have cost so much
money, and I realized I probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole system is not set up very well
to fight back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only got about a minute or two left.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great number of journalists in
America who like to be able to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: forum, I'm sure, as yours, and be able to
voice their opinion as you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way the laws are written and the
way the harassment in various communities
[SPEAKER_01]: are presented to people, they have a
tendency to withdraw from having the
[SPEAKER_01]: courage to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say to these journalists
now, dealing with the rights that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: in America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Individually?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we need journalists to stand up
and speak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they must have problems from
publication to publication, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the editorial slant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they want to go with their
editorial focus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm amazed at the amount of hemp
editorials you see all over the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: drug legalization editorials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you see from real average,
the daily papers all across America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a word that seems to be having a
hard time getting spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fanning out all over the place,
but I'm sure it's a tough sell in some
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have to just pitch it real
hard, like anybody else would,
[SPEAKER_00]: come at it in almost sort of a
business-like approach, quality manuscript
[SPEAKER_00]: on something that says, your point of
view, you can probably get it in as guest
[SPEAKER_00]: editorials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I don't think it's that
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are somewhat of an island right
now in the world of publishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing something that nobody quite is
doing, and sometimes that excites us,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other times we'd rather have a few
more friends, understand what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really not bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why the publishing industry a
lot of times doesn't lend more support
[SPEAKER_00]: towards what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like the stepchild or something,
and they want to watch from afar to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like the guinea pigs in this First
Amendment experiment or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like, let them deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good lawyer, and we have the
resources, apparently, to get as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't sunk us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would like to have, and they haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody thinks, well, why don't they
just come up and bust us all or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got nothing on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although they were taking pictures of us
the other day at the Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say on behalf of the members
of the Hemp Movement, and I have spoken to
[SPEAKER_01]: many of them, they're very appreciated for
what you are doing and the fight that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're making possible and the way you're
raising their voices.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an honor to have you on our
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have you back again sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody who is those
devoted followers of High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: More after this.
Thank you.
