[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's two things I really have
to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what else we want to cover on
this program, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing is that I will not be a
part of a system that continues to deny
[SPEAKER_02]: this very best of God's medicines does to
the hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians
[SPEAKER_02]: who suffer under diagnosed ailments and
categories of illnesses and impairments on
[SPEAKER_02]: which marijuana is proven to be the very
best relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: By God, it is obscene to me to disallow
these people with tumors and anorexia
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with nutrition-blocking
diseases, and these people for which it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the best medicine, and these nausea
patients for which it's the best medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: those folks who are taking cancer
treatment, radiation, or chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the people suffering from wide-angle
glaucoma, and the people suffering from
[SPEAKER_02]: distress and despair and depression,
and the people who sometimes don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: life's worth living, and the people who
need a tonic for life, who need to commune
[SPEAKER_02]: with Mother Earth, and they get ill and
they're sick because of the emphysema of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, the people with epilepsy,
neural disorders like multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is obscene to me to continue to
deny these people this very best medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: that could offer them relief in the next
five minutes, offer them relief in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Kentucky's got the lowest life
expectancy of any state in the union.
[SPEAKER_01]: By God, how can anybody who knows what I
just said is true be a part of anything
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been known as the center of healing,
because people are going to come there to
[SPEAKER_02]: find out what it's like to take a much
slower pace through the guard beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gatewood, some of your constituents and
some of your opponents, I'm sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: are very curious that when elected,
how do you plan to implement the hemp crop
[SPEAKER_00]: into the economy, into the working force,
into the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's three ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it can be done smoothly or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these are some very ruthless
monopolies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeking to go into a legitimate
competition with.
[SPEAKER_02]: They run whole governments and whole
dictators and they slay thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: peasants every year around the globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that they're willing to do
anything to try to destabilize me and what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to do in that state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be foolish to consider it in any other
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some things that they cannot
stop me from doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we ought to do is construct a plan
based along the alcohol and tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: production and marketing techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, no one could point to any
segment of that plan and say that won't
[SPEAKER_02]: work, because it's already in work in
either production of alcohol and tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: and distribution of those and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that I think marijuana belongs
in those categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think marijuana belongs in those
categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any doubt about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any problems with it certainly ought to be
associated with social services rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I found people who attribute
some of their malfunctioning marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just hadn't met many people who
wasn't for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want the farmer to produce it under
license.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I think every household
ought to be able to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, your relationship with Mother
Earth is the most fundamental thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even more biological than your birth
parents because they're made of the same
[SPEAKER_02]: carbons and the same earthly products as
you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all came from Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's where we came up from,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking marijuana is the closest thing to
communing with Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, eating a pound of mud, as far as I
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't feel as good after you eat
that pound of mud next morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't eat pounds of mud, folks,
because you'll lose work, and Resna Bush
[SPEAKER_02]: will come out in anti-mud hysteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I want to do is you get to grow
your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, by golly, our ability to plant a
seed in God's green earth and do what we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do with the green natural plant
that comes up out of it is the most
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamental pursuit of life, liberty,
and pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has to be one of the most
inalienable rights and guarantees,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least within the number of the
Constitution or at least within the
[SPEAKER_02]: substantive due process causes of the
Constitution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you ought to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I draw the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say, Galbraith, why not crack
cocaine and heroin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, those substances,
I understand, seem to override the freedom
[SPEAKER_02]: of choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to set those things down after
long use and try to walk away from them,
[SPEAKER_02]: they call you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the ways Richard Pryor talks
about crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kept calling him back,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't put it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard, you know, he just had to come
back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But marijuana, I don't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can lay it down and go away and do
whatever you want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it doesn't bother you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's a green natural plant,
then by golly, you ought to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to rub poison out of you all
over your body, by golly, you ought to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to rub poison out of you all over
your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: From nature, whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go out and we license the farmers to
grow a certain poundage allotment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, I'm advising every
stockbroker in the state to advise their
[SPEAKER_02]: clients to buy stock in chain link fence
companies because when these farmers get
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow this stuff, you're going to see
these little chain link enclaves like
[SPEAKER_02]: every one of Kentucky's 86,000 farms.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I'm starting my own company.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those farms, see, Kentucky has more
farms than any other state in the Union
[SPEAKER_02]: besides Ford.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you wouldn't think that from the
size of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and the farm size is only one
fifth the national average.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a matter of fact, 70% of Kentucky's
farms earn less than $15,000 a year in
[SPEAKER_02]: commodities off of the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can implement a 15 to $25,000
income to these farmers overnight for
[SPEAKER_02]: something, they don't have to add any new
land, any new labor, any new structures,
[SPEAKER_02]: any new machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they can, you know, hell,
they're doing it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I'm just going to take
helicopters out there and make them pay
[SPEAKER_02]: the taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get a better seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if a fellow has a thousand
acres over here and is making good living
[SPEAKER_02]: off of food crops and stuff like that,
I don't want to displace their land.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can grow this hemp for fuel on
marginal, but we're talking about hemp for
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal recreational purposes right now
and do this licensing system on hemp for
[SPEAKER_02]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We let it grow and occupy a competitive
market niche with fuel, but that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take place in the western part of the
state, which is, which is flat and large
[SPEAKER_02]: farms up in Appalachia, the small farms
and dirt farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want this fellow's thousand
acres having a pro rata share of the
[SPEAKER_02]: market in any kind of superior
relationship over this small farmer up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spread the wealth as it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can give everybody $50,000 a year,
we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can give everybody $100,000 a year,
we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to give it to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one, we've only got a couple more
minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only, I just started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just now in the production end up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just now in the production end up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being phased off the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if tomorrow's playing, folks,
I'm a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trust me on this one, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one more question I want to put,
because there's a lot of people now who
[SPEAKER_00]: are good citizens who have been growing
this and have been caught smoking it and
[SPEAKER_00]: now have had people come in and take their
homes, take their cars, take their boats,
[SPEAKER_00]: take their children, take their lives,
take their right to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a governor, what do you intend to do
for these people
[SPEAKER_02]: and what do you intend to do for these
people?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like you all to realize that there are
people sitting behind bars who have no
[SPEAKER_00]: right, as far as the government's
concerned, to express their opinions and
[SPEAKER_00]: their voices and they cannot be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Gatewood has said, these people
have brothers, mothers, sisters,
[SPEAKER_00]: brothers, fathers sitting out there who
can go out there and cast that vote on
[SPEAKER_00]: their behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go to your polls and let those
voices be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gatewood, it has been a real joy to
have you on our program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm absolutely honored and delighted to be
here, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Casper, I've heard about your all's
good work and I'm just real honored to be
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime we can have you on the show,
we'd love to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Mark Twain said, a compliment like that
can sustain me for months at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Gatewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, the next time you tune into
this program, focus on the fact that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying to reach out so the voice can
be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's anybody in your community that
needs to have their story told,
[SPEAKER_00]: please contact us at the address and phone
number that's flashing on your screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the next time that you see me,
that it will be time for him.
