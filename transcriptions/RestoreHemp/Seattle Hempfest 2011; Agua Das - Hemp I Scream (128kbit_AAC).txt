[SPEAKER_01]: We are making the hemp ice cream.
Ah!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the perfect cure for the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe it's not exactly a cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like the perfect accessory to
the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like an accessory after the fact
to the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes your munchies way more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get one of those, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got vanilla jasmine chocolate
mocha mint mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 420 flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five flavors a season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no dairy, no soy, no rice,
no whey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really amazing thing about the
hemp ice cream, it does not taste a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: like a rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you strong like a rope instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There ain't no bee cups there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked strategies that would let us
continue to generate thunder for American
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture without having to hold our
breath waiting for somebody to change some
[SPEAKER_00]: rules, without whining for somebody
sympathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punch your own ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a possibility and develop it into a
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food, fiber, fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: With food, we're making hemp ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out pressing some of the first
hemp seed oil in the United States since
[SPEAKER_00]: 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize we were going to be
pioneers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there were lots of other people
already doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We began making ice cream because somebody
said nobody could make ice cream out of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be 10,000 uses, but nobody could
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by New Year's that year, I had made my
first hemp ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we are out to do is we want to
grow 500 acres under a center pivot on
[SPEAKER_00]: Navajo or Apache land.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to be ready for the success,
we need to have five acres growing hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: seed or seed to plant 500 acres,
assuming a hundredfold increase each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the year before that, we need to have
five hundreds of an acre, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 foot by 20 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the year before that, we need to have
100th of that acreage, which is two foot
[SPEAKER_00]: by two foot, which is one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we're four years away from
being able to grow hemp on a scale that
[SPEAKER_00]: could have a real impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.
