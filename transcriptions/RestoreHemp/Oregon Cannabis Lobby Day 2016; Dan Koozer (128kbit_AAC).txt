[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend of mine that's a hospice
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her doctor told her that if she continued
to use medical marijuana, he wasn't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to give her prescription
painkillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's going to have to make a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before Measure 91 passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked me, she said, well, Measure 91
help in my situation, if it passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: He won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help in the long run, but it won't
help in the short run, because it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: change a thing, for your concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I left, she had a tear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is not exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a tear going on her cheek when I
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just really tragic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kind of things that keep
me going, you know, as an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been almost 20 years that John's got
me started, his fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: But almost 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I miss John, by the way, for many
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing was I would ask John,
when was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would tell me the date and how many
years ago it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he was up on numbers, and I don't
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the Oregon legislature,
in my opinion, has done a horrible job of
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing the Oregon medical marijuana
program since it began.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started out by having an incredible
director, and then didn't give her what
[SPEAKER_00]: she needed to do the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fired her because she wasn't
doing the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've stolen money from the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly it was X amount of dollars
divided by how many patients, and blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the state is making money on the
Oregon medical marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_00]: and wants more, including a $250 fee for
each grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I've got to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate everybody that showed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to do more of this because
they've got to see the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like court support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
