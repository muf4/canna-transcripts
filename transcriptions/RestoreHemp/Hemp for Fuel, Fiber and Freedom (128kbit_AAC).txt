[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the whole reason marijuana is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hemp seed oil with a hemp wick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is an aluminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp was an original aluminate before they
used whale oil, before they were using
[SPEAKER_00]: petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp seed oil was one of the first
aluminates used by humanity to light the
[SPEAKER_00]: first lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the whole reason it's illegal,
because you can pour this hemp oil right
[SPEAKER_00]: into any diesel engine, turn the key and
drive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp oil produces three times more seed
oil than any other plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also produces three times more fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some hemp twine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is produced in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp twine from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main reason marijuana is illegal is
because of hemp oil and hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marijuana laws were created to stop
the oil companies from competing with hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber, with the introduction of new
machinery that made hemp fuel and fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: much less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much less expensive to process,
much as the cotton gin had made cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: much cheaper to process 100 years before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new machinery, the decorticator,
had made hemp fiber much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fuel and fiber companies put
together a misinformation campaign we know
[SPEAKER_00]: as Reefer Madness and came up with this
name marijuana based on racist lies,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the name marijuana proves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's based on anti-Hispanic and
people of color racist propaganda that was
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent in the 20s and 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is the whole reason that
marijuana is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs are a smoke screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about fuel and fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a very, we're going to do this
every week, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love the hemp candle idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our flame of freedom that we're
going to be talking about each and every
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us, and we'll see
you next time.
