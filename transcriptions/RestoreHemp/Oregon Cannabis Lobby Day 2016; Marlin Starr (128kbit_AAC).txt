[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Marlon Starr.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Mean Green Cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a patient activist here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many years, we here in Oregon have
been leaders in the nation when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I can no longer say that we're
necessarily the leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to our lawmakers, OHA and OLCC,
we have slipped from the forefront
[SPEAKER_00]: position and we're starting to slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as individuals, we as citizens,
need to come together and step forward and
[SPEAKER_00]: make our voice known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to us, the people, to make the
changes in our state so that we are the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders in the forefront of a changing
nation and a changing world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other countries now like Australia
that is looking to the United States for
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to give them wrong guidance?
[SPEAKER_00]: I for sure do not want to because I am a
fourth generation Oregonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things that we're really
bothering me is the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we need packaging, but no,
we do not need over-regulation on the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been a green state before a green
state was popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patient's access is necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: A patient takes upwards of 21,000
milligrams or greater in their body to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to have a semblance of order and to
be able to have a normal life that you and
[SPEAKER_00]: I take for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: These truths we hold evidence as marijuana
consumers, as cannabis consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it helps us with our everyday life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps us come out and be sociable and
socialized for PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps, it helps, it helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only ones that are not helping are the
ones in this building because they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: A policy made from ignorance is not a
policy it is a fear-based legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to tell our friends that we
have 15 minutes right each in front of our
[SPEAKER_00]: legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of us need to make those
appointments, make our voices heard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we as cannabis activists can now
become cannabis leaders in a nation and in
[SPEAKER_00]: a world that is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to each and every single one of
us, not the people in this building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to you and me and every other
citizen in Oregon to do right by and for
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to stand up for each individual
patient's and their rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last meeting they already said the
train has already left on not messing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need to find a reverse and we
need to back that back up into that
[SPEAKER_00]: station and realize that patients have
rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doctors need to understand that
patients have a voice and they should not
[SPEAKER_00]: choose in between their pharmaceutical
medicines and a plant that is available on
[SPEAKER_00]: every single continent on this earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: God gave us a plant on every single
continent that goes for every single
[SPEAKER_00]: person on this earth and if we aren't
supposed to use it then we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: putting God in jail, not us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us make sure that we do right by the
United States and by our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your time.
Thank you.
