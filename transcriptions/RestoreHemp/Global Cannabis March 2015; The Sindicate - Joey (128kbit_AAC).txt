[SPEAKER_00]: This next song is about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys very much.
If
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one hundred dollars for every blunt
I've smoked,
[SPEAKER_00]: every joint I've choked, I'd be rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could just breathe in and burst
one last time, won't that high,
[SPEAKER_00]: that high would be mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't wait here too much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't wait here too much longer to be
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had just one last wish, it would be
for one more hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit when I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't wait here too much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't wait here too much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't wait here too much longer to be
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had one hundred dollars for every
blunt I've smoked, every joint I've
[SPEAKER_00]: choked, I'd be rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't wait here too much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't wait here too much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't wait here too much longer.
