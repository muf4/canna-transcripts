[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful day in Portland,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to follow up on what Russ said,
we are seeing such great, tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: success all across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, St. Louis, Missouri
decriminalized marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Springfield, Missouri decriminalized
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland just legalized medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhode Island just legalized medical
marijuana dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and Colorado legalizing
marijuana for all adults here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bill 3371 that we hope to get
referred in the 2014 that will legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for all adults, allow home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great provision, I encourage you to
check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got PTSD added as a qualifying
condition under the Medical Marijuana Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: That passed the Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing marijuana pill needs for 29 grams
to 112 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no longer a felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's likely to pass this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon's likely to have an unprecedented
success at the Oregon legislature this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done because of activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done because of people like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You call your legislator and not more than
call your legislator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just tell your truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out here has a truth about
cannabis and about how cannabis doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: hinder your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps your medical condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you more creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't impair your life in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep spreading that truth to person
after person, your friends and family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that message just spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truth shall eventually set us all
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep coming to marches like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support Urban Design, 420 Radio,
Normal, Oregon Green Free, National Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out here is working for the
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Campaign for the restoration and
regulation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support everybody.
