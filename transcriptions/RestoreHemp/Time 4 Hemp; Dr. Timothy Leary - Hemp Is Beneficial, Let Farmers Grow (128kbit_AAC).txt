[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the government is spending much
more money crushing the production of
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that puzzles me about the
insanity or even the diabolical nature of
[SPEAKER_01]: the right-wing religious Republican
situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: why do they go after the American farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: They spend more money fighting hemp in
this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in California, which is my home
state, hemp was the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural cash product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Iowa, in Tennessee, like... Back in
Indiana, where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how many states?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that we're aware of, 28 or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, honest farmers out there trying to
make a living out of growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government is out there arresting
these good-hearted, free enterprise
[SPEAKER_01]: farming agricultural Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, down in Colombia and Peru,
these gangsters, the cocaine cartel
[SPEAKER_01]: people, are making billions of dollars and
we're spending less money on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, how come?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're probably right that they
don't want people to be using hemp because
[SPEAKER_01]: it would interfere with the oil monopoly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would interfere with the wood pulp
monopoly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I think there's something really
religiously diabolic and evil about the
[SPEAKER_01]: right-wing Christians in this country who
go after hemp because they have to make
[SPEAKER_01]: their own decisions about your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be some of the people,
too, who overlook the medical aspects of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from your perspective in being a
psychiatrist, as you are, you've had the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to become acquainted with many
different aspects of healing and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the more positive benefits of the uses of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you share that, please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there have been an enormous number
of studies that show that hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis were extremely necessary for
certain forms of black coma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You simply have to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many states, these fanatic,
anti-pleasure people are so afraid that
[SPEAKER_01]: the patient who's going blind might enjoy
the experience that you've got to go blind
[SPEAKER_01]: if you die, but don't have a good time
because the Republicans are in power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's apparently the logic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they using it, too, for anorexia and
for cancer, AIDS?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's one terrible thing about
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get into the use of
marijuana, but I've got to be honest with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some terrible side effects of
smoking or using marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is it's called refrigerator blackout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, suddenly you smoke a joint,
and suddenly, there you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing you know, you've eaten nine
pounds of fig newtons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be careful there.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, if you're dying of
cancer or malnutrition, you're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be nourished because of stomach
problems and you don't have any appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp, of course, is the logical and
obvious and natural medicine to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: an appetite to see you through that
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, a good true Puritan would
rather have you die than have a good meal
[SPEAKER_01]: while you're giggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that it's good for stress to
calm you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a viewpoint of a psychiatrist,
is there any benefits for someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: might be having emotional or mental
problems as opposed to giving them like
[SPEAKER_00]: Valiums or some of these other stronger
drugs that seem to be causing problems
[SPEAKER_00]: like Prozac and so on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, number one, I don't want to come out
like a smart ass here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every psychological situation is
individual and needs its own pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to generalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly, the things about hemp is,
it's not addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have any of the side effects of
many of the euphorics and the
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressants that are approved and that
doctors prescriptions will give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, the thing about religious
fanaticism is that the crazier,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nuttier, the wilder, and almost the
more nonsensical the belief, the more you
[SPEAKER_01]: hang onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've debated for many years a man who
was the head of the DEA for about five
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Peter Bensinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't believe him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going after hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's trying to say that, oh,
hemp, they gave a lot of some mice some
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp, and it made male mice, teenage male
mice, and it made their breasts grow a
[SPEAKER_01]: little.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's saying, why are you college boys?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's even going, why is he going?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're real problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cracked babies in the inner city and
alcohol, which is our number one drug
[SPEAKER_01]: here, and nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half a million people die here from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's this guy blathering on about the
dangers of, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never even mentioned whether marijuana
would make girls' breasts bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't even want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing is so sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now you've also had a few debates with
G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gordon Liddy, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he seems to think that marijuana,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, is one of the plants that's going to
lead to a complete social breakdown in our
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know Gordon Liddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been debating him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known him for years, over 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know exactly how his mind works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like a good army man, like a good
military man, like a good policeman,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a good follower of his leader,
Richard Nixon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gordon Liddy has never had one
unauthorized thought in his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he reads the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: LSD makes you jump out of windows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana makes you, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
