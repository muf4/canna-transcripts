[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vivian, and thank you all of
you who are manifesting the spirit of love
[SPEAKER_00]: in a most unique manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a patient, I am here to thank you from
the bottom of my heart on behalf of
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands of patients here in
your state of Washington and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: millions around the world, all of whom
want their voices heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are giving thanks to the
creator for a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A gift that alleviates their symptoms to
many illnesses, and it is called cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it marijuana and tried to
demonize it by changing its name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the miracle kept proclaiming itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, everything I wear from my toes
to my head is made from that beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that God gave us and said,
here, take care of your planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are so fortunate to have so many of you
who have taken a stand for either the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, the destruction to the ocean
that's being provided by this prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you are constitutionalist and know
that the supreme law of the land cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: trashed in this fashion while we stand by
and do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are human beings with a heart and a
soul and a spirit that unites with those
[SPEAKER_00]: behind bars who have committed no crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply found a wiser bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is really, really a privilege to
say to you, thank you for having changed
[SPEAKER_00]: this laws here in the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not only because you have patients
here, but because you're aiding that light
[SPEAKER_00]: of day to come shining through the rest of
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark night of ignorance is over and
people like you have brought in to New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new day as we face the new
millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your legislators can no longer hide from
you and say, hey, we can't have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be political suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another election is coming and you're
gonna get answers from them and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna kick the ones out of office who
denied the voters power and the voters
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is someone with me who is a hero
in our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been an advocate for many,
many issues and especially for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became a patient eventually as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just went through a bout with horrible
cancer and he can tell you his story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be singing to you today because I
want Norman to speak to you and I want you
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop by the Green Cross and pick up a
copy of this tape called The War on Us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're behind the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're behind the stage, the Green Cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Norman Kent, LB's attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the opportunity to speak earlier and
LB asked me to address you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of my talk, I simply ask that
what matters most is that all of us
[SPEAKER_01]: individually, collectively, as a group,
as a community, and we truly are a
[SPEAKER_01]: community here today, stand up and be
counted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we create the world we live in by
each and every choice we make every day
[SPEAKER_01]: and to have the courage to come out of the
closet and speak up and say cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition is wrong is the beginning to
the end of that prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: What LB Musica did 12 years ago this week
in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom was say no
[SPEAKER_01]: to injustice, to stand up to prosecutors
that wanted to put her in jail,
[SPEAKER_01]: to stand up to the judge in the criminal
justice system that criminalized
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, no, I will not take a plea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I demand the right to go to a jury trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the right to advocate for a court
of law and a community of my citizens that
[SPEAKER_01]: using marijuana medicinally is in fact not
a criminal act, but a just act,
[SPEAKER_01]: a righteous act, a moral act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she took that stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was willing to go to prison to fight
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the jury and the judge acquitted her
and found her not guilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what really happened there that day is
that the criminal justice system was
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that the laws are guilty and that
we are innocent, that the laws are unjust
[SPEAKER_01]: and criminal and that we are the not
guilty ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is criminal to lock people up and
put them in jail for the simple possession
[SPEAKER_01]: of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is unjust to seize your car and
take your property and deny you student
[SPEAKER_01]: loans and prevent you from teaching in
community schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you must individually stand up
and be counted today so that you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: become the criminal, the accused criminal
tomorrow, so that you won't have to stand
[SPEAKER_01]: up in a court of law and choose between
whether or not you want your freedom or to
[SPEAKER_01]: cop a plea and accept drug testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So join with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join with me and say these words out loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Embolden yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, each and every time you stand up
for injustice, like this vast and
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful ocean, you send out a ripple and
a wave of hope and you educate the
[SPEAKER_01]: ignorant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be afraid to go home today,
tomorrow and next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they ask you where you were on
Sunday, say I took part in the road to
[SPEAKER_01]: justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was part of a new tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found out coming from Fort
Lauderdale and Vivian, I'm finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that they there's some sort of
restriction about putting up posters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see anything about this in the
big shot Seattle Times, maybe the stranger
[SPEAKER_01]: in the other papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way the mainstream community will be
turned around is when you show that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are very much a part of the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your participation here is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And LV wants to say one last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very sorry, but in our state we
have some very special heroes such as
[SPEAKER_00]: Norman and a man named Joe Hart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recently defended and we just passed
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say a prayer for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
