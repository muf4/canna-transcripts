[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Portland, how are ya?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we've been yes all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we do an initiative,
we want you to vote yes, yes, yes all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I gotta tell ya, we've got some
problems up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the very problems I talked about
on this stage, this time, last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, in Washington state,
our legislature has just passed a law that
[SPEAKER_00]: will end medical access as we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And require that patients that don't grow
for themselves obtain their medicine from
[SPEAKER_00]: the state licensed recreational shops that
allow any of up to 200 pesticides in that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may be okay for a recreational
consumer, that may be healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the levels are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here to tell you, pesticides are
not medicine for any sick person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have filed referendum 76 in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's not yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna tell them no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature has passed this law.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor signed this law.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting patients in with recreational
consumers to compete with somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to get high so that you can be well
and at an exorbitant price, we say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want us to lower our price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower our plant limits, which are already
half of what was originally recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: for any patient to provide for themselves
on down to four to six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have legalized the ounce for anybody to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they want patients to be on a
registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is because we
register one thing in Washington state,
[SPEAKER_00]: sex offenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not sex offenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no valid reason to put patients on
a registry anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Oregon, you guys did it before medical,
and that helped establish your legal
[SPEAKER_00]: framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been fighting since 1998 to get
improvements for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've gotten forward, we've gotten
forward, and now we seem to be going
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fight is on for medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, compassion is where provider
will just give medicine to someone in
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that happening in a for-profit
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever you pay, you are paying an
exorbitant tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting this tax on the very people
that can least affect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put this tax on, and people are going
to have a choice of getting less medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: or going right back to the back alleys and
black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not where we want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we refuse to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must keep medical legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already had commitments of thousands
of dollars apiece, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in for $1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stanford has said he's down for
$1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: $1,000, $1,000, $1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to add it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our patients are energized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our paper to get this referendum on the
ballot will be out May 17th, 18th,
[SPEAKER_00]: right around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our patients will do a wonderful job
collecting signatures and educating the
[SPEAKER_00]: public on why they want to vote no on
Referendum 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we won't be able to do that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all the growers that grow medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all the access points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all the doctors that provide for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all the authorizing physicians
that do a wonderful job picking up the
[SPEAKER_00]: slack of the other providers that refuse
to provide authorizations for our patients
[SPEAKER_00]: in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need $1,000 from each one of these
entities, and we need it for every quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: through this campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cost about $240,000 to
collect the signatures if we do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will cost less than that, but we need
that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: 502, which promised us, they told us,
they told us over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: 502 will not affect medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical patients will not be affected by
502, and now they want to put us right in
[SPEAKER_00]: that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a grab for power and money and
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have gone from arresting us to taking
our wallets right out of our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no on R76 will save safe access in
Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to galvanize our community as
it never has before, and it will enable us
[SPEAKER_00]: to have our discussions as a community
moving forward so that we can create
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable regulations that codify the
services we provide to patients now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an estimated 5 to 800 access
points across Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine how many people that's
serving right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: The 502 system has roughly 60 plus
licensed stores, and they're not all
[SPEAKER_00]: opened yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't even serve the recreational
demand they have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they going to serve thousands of
patients that have almost daily needs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand what the thinking was,
but we're going to struggle to get this
[SPEAKER_00]: done, we're going to get it on the ballot,
we're going to pass it in November,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're going to stand up as a
community and tell the legislators what to
[SPEAKER_00]: do right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need this to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need medical to be separate from
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do that, Friday is going to
come and the patient is going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: payday, and he's going to walk on down to
that store and be willing to pay that high
[SPEAKER_00]: tax because he's sick and he needs his
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to find out that Johnny's got a
party tonight and he bought up all that
[SPEAKER_00]: supply of that very strain that he needs
to be well simply so Johnny and his
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies could get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No on r76.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, r76no.org is our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be going live probably Monday or
Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be publicly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be public information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be volunteer opportunities and
signups and donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this done in Washington,
and I pray to God you guys keep your eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: on the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch every single thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you ended up with seed to
sale, but it seems to be going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free the plant, free the people,
promote the economy, save cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: r76no.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
