[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a very special day and a
very special event at a very special time,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I might say so myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every generation that comes
along, it becomes necessary for somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: to step forward who can articulate a
message of freedom and hope and show us a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway away from tyranny into liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this generation, that person was
Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote the book, The Emperor Wears No
Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the late 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a collection of news stories and
clippings and factoids and editorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it pretty much blew the lid off of the
whole international awareness about the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp plant, the cannabis plant,
what it used to do for us, how it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: used for 5,000 years in thousands of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also why it became illegal in this
country and how it was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it's been persecuted and
victimized for decades, for almost 80
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrer came to the First Seattle Hemp
Fest in 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot like this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked really a lot like this in
Volunteer Park in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say that these guys,
Justin and everybody have done an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a hand for all the volunteers and all
the folks that made this possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're celebrating a different aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Tacoma today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're celebrating the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most versatile plants in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in honor of Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Jack had a stroke and a heart
attack speaking at the World Hemp Expo in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people would have been done from
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never would have gone back on the
road again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jack, even though he was half
paralyzed from a stroke and he had to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn to speak again, he wasn't that great
of a speaker all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't stop him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack went back on the road and never
missed another hemp fest after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle Hemp Fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he had his next stroke,
he was speaking a hemp stock down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after he spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is that dedicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack literally gave his life for the
cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: He refused to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year he got better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his speaking spills back and pretty
soon you could really understand him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it never stopped Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he always would have to be in his
booth meeting people and signing copies of
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in honor of Jack Herrer,
if we can do this with this many people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: All enough respect and enough honor for
Jack to say thank you by a brief moment of
[SPEAKER_00]: silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can hear this generator behind us,
we know we're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just take a few moments out for a
brief moment to send out a prayer to Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think he's here with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to give it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a hand to this man who's making it
all possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
