[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling crazier than hell Got this time on
my hands And got you on my mind And got
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere else to go The fires burn hot and
cold That someplace in between the melt
[SPEAKER_00]: and the freeze This need for reaching for
you You were all I could be Now I'm here,
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing alone We were one, now I'm a ghost
Falling from my place in the sun This
[SPEAKER_00]: dizzy is out of control The world keeps
spinning I heard a vibrating echoing
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounded a lot like you Amongst the truths
I saw You were the one that I found Now
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm needing the remembering close Of
memories of you holding my hand
[SPEAKER_00]: Remembrances of laughter singing Songing
the nights with belongings Sweetnessing
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelter of each other Reality The
reality of safe feeling Crazier than hell
[SPEAKER_00]: Got this time on my hands With
[SPEAKER_00]: all these times of missing you I'm never
not going to love you These days without
[SPEAKER_00]: you to hold my hand Feeling crazier than
hell This crazy goes on and on In this
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion of me's Crazy together or crazy
apart When crazy is crazy It's not always
[SPEAKER_00]: in our heads Sometimes it's in our hearts
Feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: crazier than hell Got this time on my
hands And got you on my mind And got
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere else to go I'm never not going to
love you These days without you to hold my hand
