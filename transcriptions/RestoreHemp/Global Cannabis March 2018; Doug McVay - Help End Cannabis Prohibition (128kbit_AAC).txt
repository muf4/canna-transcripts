[SPEAKER_00]: I am Doug McVeigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the editor of a thing called Drug War
Facts at drugwarfacts.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do check it out on the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your premier source for information
on drugs, drug policies here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do some, I also do some radio work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard me on CABU.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a show called Free Culture Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have a thing called Century of Lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes out once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gotta tell you, it's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such an honor to be at the Global
Marijuana March.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a long history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're all aware of this,
but before there was the Global Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: March, a little bit of a mouthful,
there was the Million Marijuana March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before the Million Marijuana March,
as my friend Paul Stanford and I were
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing yesterday, there was the May
Day Pot Parade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now May Day, the first of May is May Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you, many of you may be aware,
but in case you're not, May Day is the
[SPEAKER_00]: International Day of Worker Solidarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: May Day is an event around the world where
tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of people gather and rally for individual
rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has been for decades, since well before
the marijuana movement started doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something on this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people wonder, well you got something
on 420, why are you doing May Day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 is a day of enforced jollity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If y'all really wanna go out and have a
party on Hitler's birthday, y'all have
[SPEAKER_00]: fun, I'll stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stay home, or I'll cover an event
that's actually going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But May Day, now that's something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this country, we have lost sight of
that, labor unions not being what they
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sort of lost sight, and people
like myself, who are proud to call
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves socialists, may not necessarily
see a lot of us out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are May Day events, and for me,
this, this is our May Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our day to reach out in solidarity
with others and say, we are your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors, we're your friends,
we're your family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke weed, we like weed, we think that
pot should be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ask you people to join with us in
calling for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so we can have a party,
I could have a party any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it weren't for legalization and drug
policy or formwork, I'd have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: time for partying, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing this because it's important,
because it's about freedom, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about justice, and it's because it's
what's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social justice is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thing called harm reduction,
where you try to reduce the harms that
[SPEAKER_00]: people do to themselves, and you manage
the risks that people expose themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drinking, drinking alcohol, maybe just one
drink an hour so that your body
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not taking a shot of whiskey to wash down
your opiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's harm reduction, because you could
kill yourself doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking marijuana to relieve your minor
pains rather than taking an opioid,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's harm reduction, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we give out clean syringes to people
who insist on injecting drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: people who inject drugs are people too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're our friends, they're our family
members, they're our sisters and our
[SPEAKER_00]: brothers, they're our parents,
they're our spouses, they're our partners,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're our friends, they're people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can either leave them to get sick
and to die, or we can do something about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Portland, there are a handful of
people who've been working for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while and it's getting a little bigger,
trying to put something together called a
[SPEAKER_00]: supervised injection facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, little off topic, this is a weed
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we got here because of drug
policy reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got here because people were
willing to break the law to do what they
[SPEAKER_00]: think is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a syringe exchange that's run
by the county in this area, Multnomah
[SPEAKER_00]: County, a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need more because of the overdose
crisis and because really, resources are
[SPEAKER_00]: just being outstripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks are working to get this
area to consider a supervised consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, a safe consumption space,
a safe injection facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of New York is running close.
[SPEAKER_00]: King County, Seattle is trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get this done in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hope to have it, in fact,
by sometime this summer down in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, it's our turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been a leader in all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been a leader in marijuana
legalization and medical marijuana and in
[SPEAKER_00]: harm reduction for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because people like you come out to
events like this and let elected leaders
[SPEAKER_00]: and officials and just these, I'll be
nice, people in places like Studio on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Square, we let them know that we really
are serious, that we want this stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: change and we're not going to go away
until it's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, we're still going to be here
because it's still not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still a lot of work to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, we have medical, but God help you if
you live in an apartment or federally
[SPEAKER_00]: subsidized housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, we have legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, do be careful if you try and
consume out here because it's illegal to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume in public and there are very
likely people who would have you arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to get through and wrap
this up in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana legalization is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug decriminalization is absolutely
vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harm reduction is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this stuff is why I do what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I volunteer several hours a week doing
radio production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I manage a few hours of working for a few
different groups, patients out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, before I leave, I need to remind
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients out of time, terrific resource,
still working on medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: still working to educate healthcare
professionals and the public, have a
[SPEAKER_00]: conference coming up May 10th through
12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be in Jersey City,
but hey, some flights are cheap if you got
[SPEAKER_00]: a chance and we'll have some video after
the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my name is Doug McVeigh,
drugwarfacts.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a lot more information and
all the stuff I've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy May Day.
