[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're in Oregon right now,
but some people from Vancouver might be
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anybody in Washington,
tell them we did legalize recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the lawmakers in Washington think that
means that we no longer need to be allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawmakers are acting like children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ashamed to be a Washingtonian now that
this law is on the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that our governor signed this law
onto the books makes me ashamed to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: Washingtonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for R-76.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will undo what the governor just did,
and it will maintain medical marijuana in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will let us keep growing 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will allow the farmers markets to keep
happening and providing the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, most affordable medicine to
patients who need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your friends about real legalization
in Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need volunteers to help with the R-76
referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
