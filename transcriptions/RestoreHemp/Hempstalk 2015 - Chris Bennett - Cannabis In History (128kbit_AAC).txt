[SPEAKER_00]: You've made history here in Oregon with
legalization last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just coming on the verge of it,
and I'm so glad to be back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the future really looks
bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all these clubs and stuff that are
forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like community centers,
and that's what this movement's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unity of the people through nature and a
plant, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when we're talking about
history, we're not only talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: history of people like Jack Herr and Eddie
Lep in prison and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people like Ray Crystal, who I shared
this stage with last year, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's gone, but that brother did so
much for this cause, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Paul helped that brother out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul's done so much for this cause,
too, and it's really important to remember
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about cannabis history,
man, we're talking about tens of thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of years of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the latest archaeological
evidence, we've been making hemp fibers
[SPEAKER_00]: for 32,000 years, and this comes in the
forms of tools used for breaking up the
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have evidence of hemp cloth 12,000
years old, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that was spread out
throughout the whole agent world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oldest evidence of burning cannabis to
inhale its fumes actually comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ukraine from 5,500 years ago from the
Proto-Indo-Europeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the same people that
domesticated the horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the domestication of the horse was
thought to come about through the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these same people that were making
hemp rope, domesticating the horse,
[SPEAKER_00]: they burned cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread the use of cannabis throughout
the agent world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't care where you're
from in this world, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your culture has a connection with this
plant, whether it be in China where
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been using cannabis seeds and
fiber for food and cloth for probably
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,000 or 5,000 years and burning it for
probably like 3,000, 4,000 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: The oldest pharmacopias from China,
the pen to sow, thought to be 2,700 BC,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,700 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is probably the first medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently they think that cavemen may have
been using cannabis to fight off
[SPEAKER_00]: parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is coming from scientists,
people like Dr. Guy Jeffries from GW
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: He suggests that cannabis played a role in
the great leap forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when humanity was discovering
things like the making the wheel and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to control fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis may have played a role in that
novel ability to think and create in new
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Mesopotamia and Assyria and
Babylonia, they burned cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: temples under the name Kanabu and also
anointed their skin with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this led over into the Hebrew use of
it where people like Moses used Kanabosom,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hebrew name of cannabis, and the holy
anointing oils and incenses, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moses would cover his body in cannabis and
myrrh and cinnamon oils and then burn that
[SPEAKER_00]: on the altar of incense and actually speak
to the Lord in the pillar of smoke over
[SPEAKER_00]: the incense altar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Persia, Zoroaster,
man, one of the great prophets of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient world, used cannabis and infused
wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the main source of enlightenment
in the Zoroastrian religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, man, going back to the Stone
Age, the longest continually worshiped God
[SPEAKER_00]: on earth, Shiva, is the Lord of cannabis,
also Lord of yoga, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole movement of ganja yoga
going on right now because that's how yoga
[SPEAKER_00]: was originally performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to India right now,
see sadhus and other holy men partaking of
[SPEAKER_00]: the holy chillum in honor of Shiva before
sitting down to their yoga practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Africa, man, it's spread all over
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pygmies say that they've been using
cannabis since the dawn of time and that
[SPEAKER_00]: God gave them hemp so they'd be healthy
and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all over the world, people have
recognized this powerful medicinal plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, first medicine, first sacrament,
and probably first recreational too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is about feeling good and
feeling positive and getting back into
[SPEAKER_00]: that vibration of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to any bar here in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you at closing time, you see fist
fights outside of that bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you that never happens once in a
medical club or a recreational club with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this plant is about and
that's what it's bringing to this planet
[SPEAKER_00]: right now in this important time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use hemp to heal our planet,
stop cutting down our old growth forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move away from fossil fuels with
hemp fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can feed the world with the most
nutritious plant on the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp's coming here to Oregon as well,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a huge de-hauled hemp seed,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can heal our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening here right now in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about not only these clubs but all
the advertising dollars, graphic artist
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, all these sub-industries,
people making concentrates, people growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the billion-dollar
crop that Jack Herr preached about for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years taking place right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time, and this year, and you
people in Oregon are leading that battle,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping next week when I go back to
Canada, we have legal weed there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an election on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy leading the polls says he's going
to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be the first country in North
America to have federal legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're making the future right now and
in the future, as Bob Marley said,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this great future of ours, don't forget
the past, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay respect to your ancestors who
brought this plant down through the ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to their wisdom, listen to their
love, and take that with you and spread it
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you all, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make way for the tree of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
