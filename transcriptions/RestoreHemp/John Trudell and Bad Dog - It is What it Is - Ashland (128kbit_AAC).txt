[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no use in wishing, hoping, and wanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those if only, and those coulda,
shoulda, and woulda's are just troubles
[SPEAKER_00]: for the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crying around about most anything is
just a waste of tears.
It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life doesn't put anything in front of us
that we can't handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in the handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coherent or incoherent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clarity or chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that ever happens is there to
make us stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we understand, our strength gets
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we don't understand, our weaknesses
get stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inevitability.
It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when falling down falls down,
how down can falling down fall?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when getting back up gets back up,
how up can getting back up get back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the reality of being, being waits for
human recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: To recognize the power of intelligence
clearly used as a way of seeing,
[SPEAKER_00]: curing, healing spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about whether we can or can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about whether we will or we won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blamers and the blamed play a
dangerous game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning responsibility into another one of
their casualties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside of ourselves and amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desperating.
[SPEAKER_00]: While hidden in the light cast behind our
shadows, life holds its breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alive wants us to live the gift we
were given.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a decision we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no use in crying and wishing and
hoping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those if only and coulda and shouldas
are just troubles for the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crying around about most anything is
just a waste of tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
It is what it is.
It is what it is.
