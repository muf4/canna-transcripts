[SPEAKER_00]: I've developed a product called Hemp
Shield, which I introduced last year here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the world's first hemp oil
containing wood finish and deck sealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be the best one ever created.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was introduced right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a year old today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our new color line, which by the
way uses the best tints that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like the normal ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually processed on this
microscopic level so that the UV rays are
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected off and you can see through to
the wood and to the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it on fancy cars and places like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every way, this is a revolutionary
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that it has more durability
and a better UV resistance than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else out there on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It beats most of the current sealers for
decks by magnitudes, not 5% or 10%,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hundreds of percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Adam educated to me last year,
the reason why it does this is because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp oil molecule is the smallest of
all the kinds of oils that are used in
[SPEAKER_00]: coatings, so it penetrates into the wood
and it also makes all those other oils
[SPEAKER_00]: work better together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have probably the best deck sealer
ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally environmentally green.
[SPEAKER_00]: No VOCs in our clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no fumes whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth of it is that because we have
called it a wood finish and a deck sealer
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean there aren't a bunch of other
uses for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having my first furniture manufacturer
come online in the next coming weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think there's a tremendous marine
application for hemp shield.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
