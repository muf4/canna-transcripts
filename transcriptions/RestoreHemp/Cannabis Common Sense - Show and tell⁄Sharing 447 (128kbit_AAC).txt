[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few different things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a box and a bottle set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 105 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's Reverend, our father,
D'Alysses, cough medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for coughs, cold, bronchitis,
whooping cough, asthma, hay fever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all afflictions of the throat and
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been, according to the literature
that's falling apart that it's been coming
[SPEAKER_00]: with, it's been found to bring relief to
the most stubborn cases among friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's found in all cases to be a health
builder and a strengthening remedy and
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful medicine within the reach of
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one should be denied it's restoring
compounds, according to this falling apart
[SPEAKER_00]: literature that comes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Father D'Alysses cough medicine is
also embossed on the back with Father D
[SPEAKER_00]: 'Alysses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down here at the bottom, it says
what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna, oh, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains opium, Indian cannabis,
heroin, alcohol, and chloroform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Father D'Alysses will give you a good
dose of mixture of opium, Indian cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin, alcohol, and chloroform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So notice it says right here, it's used by
Father D'Alysses for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also says over here, never known to
fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been known to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does a bottle like that cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our foundation got it for a
little bit over $500 and it's sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will never open this because it's
part of our museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're turning you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not opening that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, this is a museum piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it, now this is 1905,
circa 1905, Father D'Alysses magic cough
[SPEAKER_00]: remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it, we have a tincture
bottle from the 1880s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the label under glass or lug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to it, one of my favorite
supplements, hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I order this through Hemp Oil Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very nifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we were talking about, you can get 300
gallons of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the byproduct of that is this flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And high protein flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prairie emerald hemp flower is protein
enriched, gluten free, whole grain flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that imparts the nutty flavor of hemp into
a wide variety of baked goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp flower is an excellent source of
protein containing all the essential amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp flower is very high in dietary fiber
and a good source of energy for people on
[SPEAKER_00]: the go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is, hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we see hemp nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these have been hulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actual hemp seeds that have been
roasted in the outer crunchy little coats
[SPEAKER_00]: of hemp that have been taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot like a cross between
cashews and walnuts or pecans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this initial cashew-y,
buttery flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it kind of after flavor of pecans
or walnuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tim, you want to talk about,
you got our thing of hemp seed milk here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You introduced this to me a few weeks
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been bringing it on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to take one home a few weeks
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in the refrigerator, cooled it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all of the omega-3.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got 2,800 milligrams of omega-6.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all 10 essential amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got four grams of digestible protein,
essential vitamins A, B12, D, E,
[SPEAKER_01]: riboflavin, and folic acid, which is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamin Bs are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The essential minerals, magnesium,
potassium, phosphorus, iron, and good old
[SPEAKER_01]: zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to tell you, it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the ginger and hemp
granola.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new one out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found out in a health food store
ginger and granola.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just buy this stuff out there once I
see it and bring it on the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you folks out there know about the
diversity of products that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so go out there and sample some hemp
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not these, try some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be amazed at how good they are for
you.
