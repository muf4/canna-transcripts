[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a project, the North
American Industrial Hemp Commodity Board
[SPEAKER_00]: of Trade, so that parties can set up a
foundation for investment in hemp to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish information on the prices of
August hemp fiber, August seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: October seeds, to set up the mechanisms
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to do projects that will
bring everything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one thing that was changed in the
law since 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one item that was deleted from

[SPEAKER_00]: provisions for the federal government to
license industrial hemp farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constitution, rights that are not taken by
the federal government revert back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual or to the local government.
