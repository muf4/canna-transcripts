[SPEAKER_01]: Billion volunteers, thank you for this
incredible party that you've been throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: for 24 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been lucky enough to be a part of
it ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many guys have been here right after
the National Anthem, sometimes with Chris
[SPEAKER_01]: Conrad, and definitely Jack Bair,
and Mickey Norris, and so many of us
[SPEAKER_01]: through the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what it has taken for these
laws to be changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are changing in the country as they
are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am celebrating my 40th anniversary of
being a medical marijuana patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all I can do is thank the universe,
the creator, and all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would not have any sight today
if you hadn't shown me the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not a recreational smoker,
but folks, I've made up for that since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make no mistake, I am one of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the largest segment in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We belong to every segment of society,
here and abroad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done every single state in the
United States, plus Canada, Finland,
[SPEAKER_01]: Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands,
and I've never been anywhere where I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't met beautiful people that I
consider my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the beautiful people on this planet
smoke cannabis or use cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: or praise the creator for giving us
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got to end federal laws because
they are interfering with the planet's
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, with the people developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not accessing their
endocannabinoid system, so they're no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer healthy as they ought to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of every three of us is having some
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an epitome of disease going on
that can't be helped now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the states where marijuana has been
legal, we have dropped the deaths by
[SPEAKER_01]: overdoses from chemical drugs,
and that is a blessing that we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk wherever we go because we need to
change the laws in more than half the
[SPEAKER_01]: country already.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have something going too, not a penny
on part 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a state that needs to change
laws on part 20, pass the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody spends a penny on anything except
hemp, cannabis, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a penny on part 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, about the drug overdoses,
it is my pleasure to see how many people
[SPEAKER_01]: have gotten off of those drugs and that
you're all doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do remember if you're getting off of
hard drugs, whether they are
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical prescribed or otherwise,
do not go cold turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got responsibilities and work to
do, because you may harm yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you sure as heck will harm others
around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be responsible, but keep up the
good work and yes, stay off those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's so beautiful, but you need to
get to your president now, all of you,
[SPEAKER_01]: and have your letters signed by your
relatives and your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him so many letters that he can't
hide anymore, and he has to come out and
[SPEAKER_01]: sign that executive order that will
restore constitutional rights for the best
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: May God bless you and may the true spirit
of love always be your guiding light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know it, but Elvie,
for many years, is one of the only people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States that gets a big can
of joints from the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: mailed to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a prescription, not a
recommendation, and it is way past for me
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it, and I am supposed to do it at
least every two hours, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elvie's part of a pilot program.
[SPEAKER_00]: What year did it start, Elvie?
[SPEAKER_00]: The 70s?
[SPEAKER_01]: The 70s, and I've been honored of
celebrating my 27th anniversary of
[SPEAKER_01]: establishing a medical defense for the
state of Florida, who needs help
[SPEAKER_01]: desperately now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell you that Florida is legal for
marijuana, that's a lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a defense because of my case,
but you still have to go to jail,
[SPEAKER_01]: find an attorney, you need to change that
too, all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you will, you've done it so far,
and I love you.
