[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp is a strategic food and
resource for fiber, which you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing, canvas, paper, and also that
cellulose can be used to make the new
[SPEAKER_00]: substance in 1936 that DuPonts wanted to
just be made out of coal or out of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the same product of cellulose
in the stock of the Sensemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, we could be growing
medical marijuana and take the stock of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make plastic to build homes for
Hawaiians at very inexpensive rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could build an automobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show you a picture real quickly
here on page 50 of a car that Henry Ford
[SPEAKER_00]: made out of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hard for people to believe it,
but here's a car made out of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: not only did Henry Ford want the car to be
made out of plastic made from hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he wanted it to be run.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a process where you could
renewably take plants, especially hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: and after you take the seeds off for the
food to feed starving people or to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: animals or to press that oil into the
lubricating lubricants for the grease and
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally, we can use plants,
natural resources given to us by God,
[SPEAKER_00]: our creator, to solve problems here in
Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the National Review, which is the
publication of the conservative right and
[SPEAKER_00]: William F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckley who is a scholar, has come out
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second front page in a year
where he said, yeah, it's pow people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the war on drugs really lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gives 17 scholarly points in this
magazine where he feels that the way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: is harm reduction and immediate relaxation
of laws against cannabis for even
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use.
