[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to welcome you all for coming out
on this beautiful occasion to celebrate a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that we all call cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's called marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you have heard my story
before, so I'm really not going to harp on
[SPEAKER_00]: that too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscular dystrophy diagnosed at the age of
five, wheelchair bound by the age of
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the only person I know in my
lifestyle with muscular dystrophy that is
[SPEAKER_00]: not on any other medicine other than
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has made it so I can have a
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a beautiful wife standing right
here by my side like she always is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two amazing sons that are graduated
from school moving on with their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been able to succeed in life
because of a plant called marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out here are fighting this
thing we call a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, I'm out here fighting for a thing
called a war on medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This medicine is saving lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: This medicine is making it so people can
live freely without pain, anguish,
[SPEAKER_00]: and suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are out here today to show your
support for people that need that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I appreciate all of you for being out
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to do a quick shout out for
something we're getting going right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Epic Stakeholders Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are putting this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all of our Oregon growers coming
together and donating their excess
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, and we are getting it out to
patients for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free cannabis to all Oregon medical
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look us up on Facebook under the
Epic Stakeholders Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contact us at our Portland office,
Paul Stanford's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stop in at Cannabis Corner on 72nd
Herald.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the ones giving away this
medicine for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contact me, Eric Llewellyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll spell my name for you,
E-R-I-C-L-E-W-A-L-L-E-N, and I am a
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am proud to be here, and thank you all
