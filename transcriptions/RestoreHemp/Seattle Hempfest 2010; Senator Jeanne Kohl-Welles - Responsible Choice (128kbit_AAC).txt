[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for inviting me to
participate and I would especially like to
[SPEAKER_00]: say I'm very pleased that HempFest is held
every year in the 36th Legislative
[SPEAKER_00]: District, which I represent in the State
Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a year ago, actually August 20th,
former Representative Toby Nixon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Republican and Libertarian and I had an
op-ed published in the Seattle Times in
[SPEAKER_00]: which we commended HempFest in its mission
statement for quote, saying that the
[SPEAKER_00]: public is better served when citizens and
public officials work cooperatively in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to successfully accomplish common
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm about 99 plus percent
positive that people here at this forum
[SPEAKER_00]: and throughout HempFest have common goals,
which I share, I'm not sure that everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the public has that common goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would like to talk about
briefly is my perspective as a legislator
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of providing and furthering our
protections for patients, qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who are using medical marijuana
or cannabis with the authorization of
[SPEAKER_00]: their doctors and other licensed medical
professionals and also the issue of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to just give a very short
background on what we've done here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, 14 states since the early
1970s have provided the opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: states to enact decriminalization
statutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Washington State is not one
of those 14 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have tried the last two years with
legislation I introduced to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished, it's not worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to decide now what we wanna
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on public policy making and what
strategy may be the most viable to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: the common goal that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also gonna talk about the medical
marijuana issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And starting back in 1995 when I received
a call from Joanna McKee, the
[SPEAKER_00]: irreplaceable, phenomenal Joanna McKee to
get involved with medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started introducing legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sister-in-law had died a few years
earlier of cancer and she found medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana to help her with the horrible
pain and suffering and nausea that she had
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemotherapy and radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 1998, my best friend died
while we were deliberating legislation I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced on medical marijuana,
which we did not get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gladly joined with the forces to work
on getting initiative 692 approved by the
[SPEAKER_00]: voters in 1998 led by Dr. Rob Killian and
many organizations which did get
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I've worked to try to make
sure that it works effectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the law works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we get into a nexus
between legislation that goes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislative process citizen activism,
which is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thirdly, raising the visibility and
understanding of the public and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream public who don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ACLU had conducted polls that showed
that there was widespread support of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we were able to enact some
changes to make things more readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available for qualified patients to help
out providers and physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last session we enacted legislation I
introduced to allow for all licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: medical providers to provide the
authorization for qualified patients to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to utilize cannabis or medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still have a lot left to do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with regard to the medical use of
marijuana, I've been working with
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations, individuals, state
officials to refine legislation that I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be introducing next year in 2012 when the
legislature convenes in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be an omnibus medical marijuana
cannabis act because we know that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot left to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to provide for a safe,
well regulated, secure and consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: source of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that patients and providers
can access without threat of arrest and
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our current statute only allows for an
affirmative defense, which is really not
[SPEAKER_00]: much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Dominic Holden brought out in The
Stranger last week, I think it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the arrests have gone up
dramatically, even in the city of Seattle,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has an ordinance that marijuana will
have the least priority for arrest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill that I will be introducing will
also, besides providing for protection
[SPEAKER_00]: against arrest and prosecution,
will change the limitations as well that
[SPEAKER_00]: designated providers may only serve one
patient at any one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, it will allow for reciprocity
for authorized patients visiting from any
[SPEAKER_00]: state that has legal use of medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirdly, it will provide from restrictions
of, or protections from restrictions of
[SPEAKER_00]: parental rights without any proof of,
excuse me, without any proof of parents
[SPEAKER_00]: not being able to provide their
performance of parental functions
[SPEAKER_00]: adequately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also provide protections from
negative consequences for work related
[SPEAKER_00]: situations off site as long as the use of
medical marijuana is authorized and does
[SPEAKER_00]: not have any effect on the individual's
performance of work responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, and this is another very
important part of the legislation that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working on, that we will create a
system for licensing and regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: production and dispensing of medical
marijuana for qualified patients through
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Agriculture and the
Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, it's a big step forward if we
can get through the provisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as a legislator, I know that what has
to happen is we have to convince a
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of legislators to get that
accomplished, which is where many of you
[SPEAKER_00]: come in to help persuade legislators that
this is really, really important to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to the discussion of
legalization, I had been convinced two
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago that the best way to go about
getting to that stage was to have
[SPEAKER_00]: deregulation come about first.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, we're not one of
the 14 states that allow for deregulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: dating back to the 1970s, and it seemed
like too much of a leap for the public to
[SPEAKER_00]: accept and for legislators, too,
that we go the full legalization route.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have since been convinced through
the incredible work of Sensible
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, which has raised the
visibility in the public dramatically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as well as other groups working on
this issue, that we should tackle
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be interesting to see what
happens in California in November with
[SPEAKER_00]: their initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Douglas Hyatt, who will be speaking,
and I've had many conversations about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this is a good example of supporting
the common goals, but maybe having a
[SPEAKER_00]: different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very important to work on
this legislatively first so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: raise the profile in the public for the
more mainstream public who may not get it
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But secondly, I wish that the initiative
that apparently is being offered in 2011
[SPEAKER_00]: would do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, provide regulation, because although
Douglas will say that the legislature can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide regulation, it takes two-thirds
vote of the legislature to amend an
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative after it's approved by the
voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: After two years, it's a simple majority,
but the legislature really, very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very rarely amends an initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd rather have regulations within the
initiative language or directions to the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate agencies or the local
government such as in the case with the
[SPEAKER_00]: California initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, I think 2012 would be a
better year with more likelihood of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the measure approved by the voters
because it would be a huge voter turnout
[SPEAKER_00]: year with the presidential election and
gubernatorial election.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011 elections are city and county ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not gonna have the pull to
get as many voters out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I support the goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a citizen initiative is the way to
do it, that's fine with me and I will work
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanna make sure that we're
approaching it in the most effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
