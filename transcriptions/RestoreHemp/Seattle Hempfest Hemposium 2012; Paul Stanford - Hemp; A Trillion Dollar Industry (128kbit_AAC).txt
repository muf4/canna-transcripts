[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if we win in Oregon and when
they win in Colorado with Amendment 64 and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a lot of us had problems with
Prop 19 and there were the provisions of
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was some dissension in
California but our opposition is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at 502 and if it doesn't pass they're
going to think well that shows people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't in favor of marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't talk about the specifics that
patients had a problem with or marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: growers have a problem with it'll just be
a defeat same way that Prop 19 was a
[SPEAKER_00]: defeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if all of those initiatives pass
it could be much akin to the fall of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin Wall or the toppling of Lennon's
statue in Red Square that the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: edifice of marijuana prohibition will
crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that happens in five years we're going
to be talking about a huge new industry
[SPEAKER_00]: several new industries not just one you
know Steve D'Angelo and I both were there
[SPEAKER_00]: at the inception of the hemp industry in
the early 90s and late 80s as several
[SPEAKER_00]: other people here in the audience have
been as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the hemp industry when it's
freed of the shackles and the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial barriers of prohibition I think
that the hemp industry will dwarf the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis marijuana industry I think hemp
fuel is going to be the primary engine of
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think hemp fiber is going to be a
large component we already see hemp food
[SPEAKER_00]: in most of the stores and a billion dollar
industry it really is a trillion dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: industry now you know in 1937 popular
mechanics said that it was a billion
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar industry it's a trillion dollar
industry now Dave Sieber is holding up a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of hemp fiber board he helped
pioneer the production of that at
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State University back in the
80s and so I think that when we replace
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemical fuels with biofuels
particularly hemp fuel that instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: putting all our money into you know the
energy industries the world's largest
[SPEAKER_00]: industry currently it goes to the sheiks
in Saudi Arabia the despots in OPEC the
[SPEAKER_00]: corporatists in Exxon and Mobil and that
money instead of going into those folks
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets and their Swiss bank accounts will
go to our farmers and our communities and
[SPEAKER_00]: just realign our whole economy there'll be
a whole new set of problems of course but
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're on the verge of
creating several new environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable industries that will change
society and our whole economic paradigm
[SPEAKER_00]: you thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you
