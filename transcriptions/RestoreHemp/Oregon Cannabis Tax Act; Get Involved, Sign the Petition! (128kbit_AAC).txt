[SPEAKER_01]: The name, the Cannabis, or you're calling
it the Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon Cannabis Tax Act, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I use it, the analogy is it's like
coming into a film and the film's halfway
[SPEAKER_01]: through, and we don't know how we got
here, but I mean, people need to pull back
[SPEAKER_01]: and go, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point in history, the government
stepped in and said they have the right to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell us what seeds we can plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the thing that we're doing,
we're being so peaceful about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you really think about it,
they've taken the right upon themselves to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell us what seeds we can plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gatewood Galbraith woke me up to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What seeds we can plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can debate processing something in a
laboratory, but when the government steps
[SPEAKER_01]: in and says you can't plant this seed,
then they've taken the right to say you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't plant any seed, and that crosses the
line of just basic common law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's insanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get your mother, your
grandmother, your brother, your sister,
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody that wants freedom, whether they
smoke marijuana or not, and wake them up
[SPEAKER_01]: and say they've taken the freedom away
from us to grow a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down there in mass and get this
petition signed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be done in two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people knew what it represented,
they would do it immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 80,000 signatures that are necessary
should be done automatically, whether you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke pot or not smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bring back the right to the people to
plant any plant that we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bow down to them like they're the
sovereign, the ruler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, let's get over this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think is cool about it is how many
groups of people get together and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: taxes, take our money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, we want to give it to you,
Uncle Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to come together and say,
here's a lot of cash out of my pocket
[SPEAKER_02]: voluntarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it out of the black market and put it
in the mainstream economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the cool thing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're saying, please, taxes, where there's
a lot of people because April 15th is
[SPEAKER_02]: coming around who are dodging their taxes
and looking for loopholes and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: get out of paying their fair share and all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're saying, look, we're buying this
stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you, please, take some more
money out of my pocket and tax me?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not millions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the cool thing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government should be going,
wow, here's citizens of our country
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, please, take our tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be jumping up and down there in
Washington going, let's sign this bill
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul, I've got a question as to how we can
get these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 70,000 signatures that we need?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, we have just over 50,000
signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need 87,213 valid registered Oregon
voter signatures to put this thing on the
[SPEAKER_03]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some signatures aren't valid,
they're illegible, or they aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: registered to vote, we have to turn in in
excess of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to turn in at least 120,
preferably 140,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have about 20 weeks to go until
July 6th to gather the total number of
[SPEAKER_03]: signatures, turn it into the state,
and then that forces a vote on this
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find out more about that at
CannabisTaxAct.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question that I have is how can we use
the time value that we have in between now
[SPEAKER_00]: and where we've got to get and leverage
that to the greatest portion possible in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of, you said that someone can go to
your website, they can download the form,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can fill it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can print it out, sign it,
and send it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what I'm trying to figure out is
how can we use social media because
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you consider yourself a Democrat,
a Republican, an Independent, a
[SPEAKER_00]: Libertarian, a Martian, whoever you are,
you have all of these people connected to
[SPEAKER_00]: your friends, family, and coworkers that
are linked through your LinkedIn,
[SPEAKER_00]: your Twitter, your Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow, some way, you need to post this
stuff into your space so that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: share it, so that they can download this
stuff in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do not live in Oregon,
but you have friends and family that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, that know people that live in
Oregon, you need to get this into your
[SPEAKER_00]: social network so by sharing it,
and tweeting it, and Facebooking it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and texting it, or whatever you're doing
with it, somehow we need to use social
[SPEAKER_00]: networks to get this number done.
