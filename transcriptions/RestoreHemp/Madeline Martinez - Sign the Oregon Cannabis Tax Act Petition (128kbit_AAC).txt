[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so very much for being here
this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here for a worthy cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before that, just let me say,
Jack, your spirit will never die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, but you will live on to do your
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to ask each and every one
of you here today to please, please get
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and help us re-legalize
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I tell this to people every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these huge meetings at Oregon
Normal, 200 people at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming to look them, but they lose their
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose their children through child
custody battles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Divorces get ugly and they bring in,
you're a medical marijuana patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't deserve to have your kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to change that because
we're going to have a cannabis tax act
[SPEAKER_00]: where people can go and
[SPEAKER_00]: be afraid of the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each and every one of you to put the joint
down, step away from your bong just for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while, write a letter, send a fax,
make a phone call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just sit there and take this shit
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do
[SPEAKER_00]: it because Jack taught us well and he knew
the power of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew it could save our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody remember this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember he gave his life to this movement
and now we owe it to him to re-legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that each of us has one small voice,
but together we are a giant roar that can
[SPEAKER_00]: shake the halls of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me legalize hemp.
