[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, hemp, hooray!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, hemp, hooray!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, hemp, hooray!
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're having a hempy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm so excited to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to each of these over the last
17 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time we've had two mayoral
candidates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty exciting, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than our friend Lou Frederick,
who's going to be in the Senate next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the first time we've had somebody
from the legislature this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I'm always reminded at times
like this about how lucky we are to be
[SPEAKER_00]: here, having freed the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially having, for me,
lived long enough to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at times like this, I remember the
folks who didn't, and I hope you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been working some with is
Michael here, Iko?
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Backer right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you give it up for him, please?
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole thing would not happen but for
his energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were back and forth a little bit
yesterday because I was in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: Congressman Blumenauer's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not able to be here today,
but he's, you know, he's very supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Iko had back and forth with the city
this week about, you know, where we were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to march and why are we
still marching?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I'd spend just a couple of
minutes talking with you about why we're
[SPEAKER_00]: still marching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody remember Dan Bo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel Ernst?
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel Ernst is serving 15 years in
federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a letter from him this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we march.
[SPEAKER_00]: We march because there are people in
federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is cannabis legal everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: We march because marijuana is still on the
controlled substances list when it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be descheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We march because people call marijuana an
entry drug when it's actually an exit
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, an exit from addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We march because the OHA treats marijuana
like it was poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it's a wellness drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that in our lifetime we'll be able
to go down to Walgreens and get us some
[SPEAKER_00]: wall FECO or some wall RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what's coming next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that we make a show of
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate what Ted had to say about the
industry and I appreciate what Tobias had
[SPEAKER_00]: to say about the industry, but I'm a
consumer and I work towards reforming
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis laws for consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and if you're talking
particularly about income inequality and
[SPEAKER_00]: racism, Ted, the fees for the city of
Portland licensing are a barrier to people
[SPEAKER_00]: of color getting involved in the system,
to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I didn't do this for 20 years so
that white men could get rich and black
[SPEAKER_00]: kids would be in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to end that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person who's here who's working to end
that is Madeline Martinez, who's speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: next Sunday evening in Denver at a
cannabis diversity summit that our sister,
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlo Green, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit from Anchorage is putting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find your way to Denver next
Sunday, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember what, remember that,
that our work is not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Harrison Conley, our friend who
lobbied on Madeline's behalf says we freed
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed, except you can't use it indoor
or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need and what we hope the next
mayor does Ted is allow us to consume here
[SPEAKER_00]: at this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to allow us to consume at Hamstock by
not enforcing the violation during those
[SPEAKER_00]: two days out of the 365 days in the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
