[SPEAKER_00]: Chris serves as a lead advocate at the
Coalition for Medical Marijuana in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey and the Pennsylvanians for Medical
Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also serves on the board of
Philadelphia Normal and Normal New Jersey
[SPEAKER_00]: and was the founder of Normal's highly
rated podcast back when he was based in
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, tell us about New Jersey and
Philly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot is not just for California anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a long, wonderful tradition with
marijuana on the East Coast, but really in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last couple of years we've seen a
whirlwind of reform activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the East Coast we are bound to the
legislative process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have a ballot initiative process
that we can employ to change law or bring
[SPEAKER_01]: up new law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you what, this year we've
seen something really revolutionary happen
[SPEAKER_01]: in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am the bearer of good and bad news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've heard about New Jersey's
medical marijuana law and I'm working very
[SPEAKER_01]: hard on this with Ken Wolski at the
Coalition for Medical Marijuana in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken's been at these conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He attends the Patients Out of Time
Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a registered nurse and the director
of our coalition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to tell you, and we'll get into
this in just a second, New Jersey is about
[SPEAKER_01]: to run a revolution on medical marijuana
and it's not a revolution any of us are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be real happy with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about the good stuff
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here on the screen you will see the
July issue of Philadelphia magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They interviewed women, for the pot is
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all of us are saying, well,
where did pot go?
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't go on vacation, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot's always been around, but it looks
like the media in Philadelphia,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, and New Jersey are just finally
starting to wake up to the fact that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can cover this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That this is an issue that isn't just in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an issue that exists around them
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Philadelphia magazine went out and
did was interview yuppies smoking pot on
[SPEAKER_01]: the main line in Philadelphia after work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bankers, a lot of women.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to use the term, but sort of the
stiletto stoner kind of an interview is
[SPEAKER_01]: what this turned into be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself and State Senator Dalen Leach were
the only people quoted with our real name
[SPEAKER_01]: in what was a long feature-length article
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also sampled the local marijuana in
Philadelphia and did a write-up of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was an innovation, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it wasn't very savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy starts out the article and he
says, I'm a cop, but I can get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I look like a cop, but I can get
great marijuana around Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm here to tell you, if you don't
look like a cop, you can get even better
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana around Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it was the Philadelphia
police that we worked really closely with
[SPEAKER_01]: this year, and I have to thank Harry
Levine for his support.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pointed out the racial disparity on the
arrests in Philadelphia this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the city responded positively to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time that we really
reached out to municipal government,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they sort of reached out back to us
and had a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot is back in Philadelphia, New Jersey,
folks, as you can see on this magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey passed a medical marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right there at the State House.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our senator, Nicholas Gattari of
New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a meeting with him a couple of
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey has a new resolution right now
to support H.R.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2835.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey could be the first state to
pass a resolution to support the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's sponsored by Barney Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a New Jersey boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was born in Bayonne.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in touch with Congressman Frank to
do some appearances in New Jersey about
[SPEAKER_01]: the new resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news is we passed a medical
marijuana law this year that is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive in the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in implementing this law, we are up
against one of the biggest hurdles I have
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in the marijuana movement thus far.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey is a unique place to have a
medical marijuana law passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is where four of the seven largest
pharmaceutical companies in the world are
[SPEAKER_01]: based.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a state that has unique state
regulations that exist for this medical
[SPEAKER_01]: and pharmaceutical industry in order to
work with the state and these entities and
[SPEAKER_01]: the universities and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have heard that they were going
to give a monopoly production contract to
[SPEAKER_01]: Rutgers University this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't really just Rutgers
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Rutgers University and a couple of
small companies that already work on
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-based pharmaceuticals through
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were really going to try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's going to be next for New
Jersey?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working on the implementation of
the medical marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are proposing that six alternative
treatment centers serve the entire state
[SPEAKER_01]: of New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are still moving towards a
centralized production of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we as advocates have our foot in the
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need a little help pushing behind
us or the door is going to close right on
[SPEAKER_01]: our foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because other than us lobbying the state
government, we have the heavies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical and the pharmaceutical
industry in New Jersey are about to sink a
[SPEAKER_01]: test well into medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be approved right through the
state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it weren't for the tenacity
of this Democratic senator from New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey, they would have written Rutgers
University into the law and we'd all be
[SPEAKER_01]: turning around going, what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the truth of what's happening
in New Jersey right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't receive the attention that it
deserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's so quiet through this
implementation phase, it's just what these
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate interests want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go back to this slide here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's us in front of the state house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with a few press conferences,
Ken Wolski, our patient population of New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey, an MS patient who went on trial
named John Wilson, we've garnered
[SPEAKER_01]: significant media attention and we turned
the corner on the Rutgers University idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our governor, Chris Christie,
Republican governor of New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_01]: think of him if you've ever seen The
Sopranos.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's sort of like Tony Soprano mixed with
Karl Rove.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what we have as our
governor in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's a former U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he believes in medical marijuana,
but he wants to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the New Jersey State Teaching
Hospitals Association was going to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: monopoly contract on distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their representative, Rick Goldstein,
no relation, showed up at the High Times
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical Cannabis Cup and he found every
grower he could and he asked them,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you could only grow three strains of
marijuana, what would they be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you all know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: The centralization, the homogenization of
medical marijuana could start in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the interest that we are
fighting against is that small business
[SPEAKER_01]: and this movement and the ideal of medical
marijuana needs to be reinstilled here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana is a challenge to the
healthcare system of America overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires doctors and patients to talk
to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires doctors to go and look up
specific information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires a real relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the healthcare that we have
today where you go in and you speak to
[SPEAKER_01]: your physician for five minutes and get
prescribed a pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to do that with medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want some sort of consistent
homogenized brand for this that doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: are comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comfort zone of the medical industry
is what we're fighting against.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that in New Jersey we are
working hard to meld these ideals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is inevitable that corporate interests
are going to get involved with medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be able to fight them in
New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our nonprofit's there as hard as we work
and as hard as our volunteers work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to be able to fight that
interest in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's inevitable that they're going to
get involved nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, do we have a place at the
table or do they try and take it over 100
[SPEAKER_01]: percent?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the models in New Jersey have already
been taken on in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two ounces, no home cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, we're not happy about this law
and we're fighting to change it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, again, the inevitability of corporate
interest seeing and counting their coin on
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana right now in New Jersey
is the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: How this is going to play out,
I wish I could tell you here at the
[SPEAKER_01]: conference today, but we will see it
happen over the next six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's talk about happy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the district attorney of
Philadelphia, standing with myself and the
[SPEAKER_01]: radio producer, Marty Moskowin of Radio
Times in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the first African American district
attorney in Philadelphia's history,
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth Williams.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was elected this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we eased the possession penalty for
all Philadelphia residents this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was through one set of data,
three meetings with city officials and
[SPEAKER_01]: police, and this gentleman right here
seeking the support of the State Supreme
[SPEAKER_01]: Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Philadelphia was the last county in
Pennsylvania that required every single
[SPEAKER_01]: person who was caught with any amount of
marijuana from a joint to 30 grams to be
[SPEAKER_01]: prosecuted through the court to make a
$300 bail hearing and to show up for
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal prosecution even if they were
going to take a disorderly conduct plea.
[SPEAKER_01]: 4700 cases a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: 75% black men between the age of 19 and
35.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 10 white women a month are cited for
marijuana possession in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm Philly normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can find more than 10 white women
smoking pot, walking in the city for like
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 minutes, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth is, is that Philadelphia
police only find 10 white women a month,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they find 362 black men a month to
cite for marijuana possession less than 30
[SPEAKER_01]: grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: The procedure before was go to court,
make bail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The procedure now starting in June is that
you go into a diversion program.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the point of arrest, you are offered
the diversion program.
[SPEAKER_01]: You no longer have to make bail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You show up in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pay a $200 fine, and it is
automatically expunged from your record.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a tangible change for the
marijuana consumers of Philadelphia this
[SPEAKER_01]: year, and this has been of positive
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot even tell you how many people hug
me at concerts and thank me because they
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the, they're like, God,
I got busted last year, but this year it
[SPEAKER_01]: was so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, you know, it's Seth Williams and
Harry Levine who is sitting out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you, if it weren't for
Harry's data and his work in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and knowing how to pursue that
and getting the data and really
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighting the racial disparity,
you know, this is the key for us on the
[SPEAKER_01]: East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we found police and
prosecutors and city officials.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no argument back from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no opposition to the racial
disparity argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bad any way you look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem that people want to solve,
and it's our job to give them the tools to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So New York this year, just so everybody
didn't miss, there was the National Normal
[SPEAKER_01]: ad ran in Times Square.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's me and Rick Cusick and Steve Blum
from Celebstoner and Danny Danko from High
[SPEAKER_01]: Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was running.
[SPEAKER_01]: We waited in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ran on this big screen, so we had to
wait for the 15 seconds to take the
[SPEAKER_01]: picture, but National Normal Times Square
this year had an ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions of people saw it this year,
and you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like people are going,
oh, my God, there's a marijuana leaf on
[SPEAKER_01]: Times Square.
[SPEAKER_01]: People see that, come up, and they cheer,
and that is what is happening on the East
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a 1,200-people march up South
Street this year for the Global Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: March.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an excellent parade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't quite start yet, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I'm going to get it to
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay if it doesn't start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was our biggest march ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no arrests at the annual
Cannabis March this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to let people know that while the
focus of reform activity is rightfully so
[SPEAKER_01]: on California's economy this year,
that New Jersey and Philadelphia have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous strides forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a medical marijuana bill in
Pennsylvania right now, HB 1393.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it introduced in the House and the
Senate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just three weeks ago, in Pittsburgh,
we had special hearings where we Skyped in
[SPEAKER_01]: Lester Greenspoon, which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Dr. Cyril Wecht, a forensic
pathologist, testify that in over 38,000
[SPEAKER_01]: autopsies, cannabis was never a cause of
death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we know that, but it's
important to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it may seem passe to a lot of folks
who have already won these battles in
[SPEAKER_01]: other states, but this is a discussion
that never happened in the Keystone state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never had a bill in Pennsylvania ever
before this year, and it's a discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eighty percent of Pennsylvanians support
medical marijuana from both parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the most strongly supported
Republican public policy issue in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state of Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think, amongst the Republicans and
Democrats, that the medical marijuana bill
[SPEAKER_01]: is more positive than any candidate for
governor, any candidate for Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Pennsylvania, it's hard for people to
handle this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, politicians get a 37, 40 percent
approval rating on a poll, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: popping champagne bottles and trying to
have sex with the interns in the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eighty percent is something that they
don't know how to handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the most popular public policy issue
the state of Pennsylvania has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's ever polled is this medical
marijuana bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Politicians, politicos, people in the
state house and the media struggle with
[SPEAKER_01]: the popularity of medical marijuana on
this basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's our job to make sure that
marijuana law reform, whether that be
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization, legalization,
or medical marijuana bills, we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn this corner with the politicos in
America, especially the state legislators.
[SPEAKER_01]: This medical marijuana is not
controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eighty percent approval rating?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the most positive political
capital you can have in America today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to win elections, you need to
support marijuana reform, and that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: message we're going to take out there at
the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
