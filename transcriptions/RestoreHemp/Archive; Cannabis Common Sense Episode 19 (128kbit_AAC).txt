[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for Cannabis Common Sense,
the show that tells you the truth about
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana and the politics behind its
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now here's the host of the show,
Paul Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may know that our program is a
production of our political committee,
[SPEAKER_00]: Campaign for the Restoration and
Regulation of Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our political committee is circulating a
petition, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a referendum to recall the
legislature's bill to recriminalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: On today's show, we have my lovely wife,
Teresa Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Donna McPherson, Treasurer of Portland
Normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Teresa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Donna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we've been circulating the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act on a volunteer
[SPEAKER_00]: basis until just the past week,
when we've finally been able to start
[SPEAKER_00]: paying petitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also starting to circulate a
referendum petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a petition to tax and regulate the
sales of marijuana to adult and state
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor stores, license farmers to grow the
drug for sales to the OLCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will let the OLCC put it in pharmacies
at cost and then in the state liquor
[SPEAKER_00]: stores and bars and smoking establishments
that bar the entrance of those under 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also allow farmers without a
license to cultivate industrial hemp to
[SPEAKER_00]: make paper, fabric, protein, and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just begun circulating the
referendum to recriminalize what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: House Bill 3643.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bill was passed by the legislature to
recriminalize simple possession of under
[SPEAKER_00]: an ounce of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fighting hard to help get these
things on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the referendum on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to vote no on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act on
the ballot, we want you to vote yes on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give us a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we need you to give us a call so
that we can get these petitions into your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a call at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outside the Portland area,
then it's 1503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get our petitions through the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you can watch this TV program
through the internet now, through our
[SPEAKER_00]: webpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the webpage address is www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right at that page, you'll find a link
where you'll be able to download and print
[SPEAKER_00]: our petitions on your home printer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a waterproof inkjet printer
or a laser printer, we urge you to print
[SPEAKER_00]: the petitions right from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to go into some of the
usefulness of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been looking at some of our past
shows and thought that we were having too
[SPEAKER_00]: many men on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just talking guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought that we needed to try to
encourage the women out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's females working too hard for this
cause.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to let you know that this is a
diverse movement that we're forming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes everybody putting in what they
think is their talent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I first started doing the
activist work, I thought, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do I want to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was fortunate enough to at first start
making hemp seed cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the kind that's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually used for birdseed,
but it's got such a good nutty taste that
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually made this really good,
like raisin, chocolate chip, and hemp seed
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one time we're at an event where I
was selling these.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a bake sale, but it was actually
a part of another thing like musical
[SPEAKER_03]: activities.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at the Mount Tabor Pub,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened was I was in the bathroom
and a lady said to me, wow, did you taste
[SPEAKER_03]: those hemp seed cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, yeah, in fact, I made them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I knew that they turned out really
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Donna here is also a really good cook.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do more than cook, but we are putting
our talents into place.
[SPEAKER_03]: She baked for our New Year's Eve benefit,
some really good like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to go into what you made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Little cheesecakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone can appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were great, I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best I've ever tasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I've been spending most of my
time lately working on the referendum
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're so short of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the present, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the past in the cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have until October 3rd to get
48,000, is it, good signatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: 48,000 good signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we need 48,000, we'll really need
to turn in 60 or 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 65,000 to make certain we've got
enough valid signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've been spending most of
my time on lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've discovered that not only can you
gather signatures at our usual place,
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday Market, I've done it on the bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people out there who need to sign
this because this is not just a matter of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The referendum is to keep Oregon from
going backwards in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things would be worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be more illegal than it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a regressive bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require the bill that the
legislature passed that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: force a vote on and hopefully we'll get
the state to vote against.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will require the suspension of
driver's licenses for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're caught with marijuana,
it could be anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be wherever, at a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your driver's license will be suspended
for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it requires the mandatory diversion
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have to go in for your analysis,
a drug counseling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably make you enter a program
all at your own expense that probably will
[SPEAKER_00]: cost $2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get your driver's license back
until you've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another aspect of the recriminalization is
that it allows the police to expand the
[SPEAKER_00]: powers of search and seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they said that was the main
reason they wanted this was as a tool to
[SPEAKER_00]: law enforcement to expand the powers of
search and seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could come in and seize your home,
your car, your children, and put you in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grips of the ever-growing police
state, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're circulating our petitions and
we urge you to call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 235-4606 so that we can send these
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really do need your help.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the only way to stop the madness
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about one of the most
beneficial, useful plants on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also worked with Hemp Paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been my passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked with a company that sold
tree-free paper and it prospered for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I realize our goal will only be
met if we can decentralize hemp and grow
[SPEAKER_03]: it here in our fields here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll lower the cost, that's for
certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper's very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ship it around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of shipping costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have beautiful forests here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can understand why you would want to
cut down trees for timber for use in
[SPEAKER_01]: construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why, when you can use hemp,
why would anybody want to cut down a tree
[SPEAKER_01]: just to make paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp paper is much better anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper was invented from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually want to go back to traditional
production of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to do that by allowing
industrial hemp in the Oregon Cannabis Tax
[SPEAKER_00]: Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: How else do you think the marijuana
prohibition specifically impacts women?
[SPEAKER_00]: How else do you think this issue is really
important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that a lot of women,
there probably are as many women that use
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana as there are men.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know that from going to normal
meetings or from seeing this show until
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But women have got to come forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one thing, there's some specifically
useful things for women.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for cramps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for PMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going into menopause myself,
and I've found that it's been very useful
[SPEAKER_01]: for some of the symptoms of menopause,
like hot flashes and hot flashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all those things that affect women
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, marijuana was prescribed to Queen
Victoria for menstrual cramps and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look in the pharmacopias up
until the middle of this century,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana was prescribed for many
different ailments during childbirth,
[SPEAKER_00]: morning sickness, cramps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, it had a lot of usefulness
with women in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depression, that was the other thing I was
trying to think of particularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that a lot of menopausal women get
depressed easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's very good for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I believe it's a stress reliever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, stress is the number one killer
in America today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So which do you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to put this issue on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I interrupt and say it so often,
but I'll do it one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if somebody is out there channel
surfing across their cable channel or
[SPEAKER_00]: watching this, we need to stress the fact
that we want you to call us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our two petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act and the
referendum to stop the recriminalization
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to send those to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a newspaper we put out that
is reprints of major articles dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: this issue from around the country and
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Hemp News.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find that on the internet too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even download the petitions on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to look at the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pull the petition right from there at
www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one useful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we get more women involved in this
movement?
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe everyone has a talent.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I chose also to do, besides making
cookies, was to get into fundraising.
[SPEAKER_03]: We held a benefit at the temple on 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I and a few others, we started off a
small group, four or five people,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Trillion Green come, other living
things, the last debut of Ground Score.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many different aspects that you
can help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you need to do is, of course,
contact us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tell us what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Petitioning, obviously, is the most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do enjoy doing that also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you get to interact with people
for a common cause.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have had a lot of fun, basically,
just getting to know the activists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope everyone out there that hears
this message realizes that you too can do
[SPEAKER_03]: something to help the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this would also help bring in so
much money for tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I originally wanted to fund schools with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this time, we're just basically
needing it to be open for pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: purposes, for doctors to prescribe it,
farmers, and of course, so we can grow it
[SPEAKER_03]: for paper and all the other industrial
uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we urge you to give us a call once
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phone number is 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us send the petitions out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teresa was talking about helping with
fundraising or events and petitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have office work that needs to be
done, newspaper, deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just tons of different ways that
you could get active if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first step is to call us at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us send you the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us send you the referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get 50,000 good signatures by
early October to stop the
[SPEAKER_00]: recriminalization of marijuana from going
into effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might want to mention that while you're
petitioning, you can also register voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always ask, the first thing I say to
people when I walk up to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you a registered voter?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, if they say that they're
not registered Oregon voters, I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you like to register now?
[SPEAKER_01]: We always carry registration forms and we
delight in registering people who haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: been active in politics as of yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and if you've just moved to Oregon
and you want to become a registered voter
[SPEAKER_03]: here, all you have to do is be here for 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you have an address to move to,
that's all you have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to have a residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like residence for college
tuition purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as soon as you've moved here,
you can register to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can vote in the first,
if you've been here within 20 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can vote in the elections.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can register right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to delay that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you want to go out and
circulate our petition, it's a fun way for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to earn money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are circulating these two petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're paying per signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get 15 people an hour,
let me tell you that that is a slow
[SPEAKER_00]: average.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get 15 people an hour to sign the
petition just about anywhere you go out in
[SPEAKER_00]: public if you try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, a person is earning $10 an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in a good location where
there are a lot of people, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get 30 people to sign the
petition an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, you're earning $20 an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to go out and earn money
and help make a political change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're doing with these two
petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get out there and help us
circulate it, and you need to earn money
[SPEAKER_00]: and earn a living, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we currently are paying on both
petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that doesn't mean that we don't want
you to do it if you want to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to do it regardless of what
you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want everybody to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need everybody to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've discovered a lot of people out there
will sign it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's seldom anyone who doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people even comment, well,
I don't even smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just think that it should be
available, especially to the medically
[SPEAKER_03]: ill, and just on a general freedom basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that the issue isn't
drugs at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're out here working so
hard at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a volunteer personally, as is Theresa
and Donna.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that we discourage
anyone from going out there and earning
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got bills to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to go and earn money in a
good way, circulating our petitions is one
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our campaign has been a totally volunteer
one up until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been completely volunteer until just
the past month in mid-July when some folks
[SPEAKER_00]: came forward and pledged some money so
that we can begin paying petitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we can, we urge everyone that
needs work to give us a call at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get our petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a newspaper out there that we
give out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're petitioning, it's a good thing
to get people, keeps them informed on all
[SPEAKER_00]: the breakthroughs that are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Hemp News.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also available, as I think I said
earlier, on our web page at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just important that you get
involved, whether you want to get paid or
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do it on a volunteer basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But call us and contact us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think especially, I know a lot of
medical users through the Alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: Health Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are people that basically are
either going through chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have AIDS, or they have some disease
like multiple sclerosis that causes
[SPEAKER_01]: spasms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these people cannot eat because of
the effects of some of the medication
[SPEAKER_01]: they're taking unless they smoke
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wasting away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the specific things
that's particularly good for the wasting
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've known other people with problems
with spasms or phantom pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is one of the best things for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no exemption.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make sure, you know,
in the recriminalization bill does not
[SPEAKER_01]: exempt medical users.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will happen is that people who are
in pain, people who are in wheelchairs,
[SPEAKER_01]: will go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hemp is useful as a medicine for
many different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to torture those people by bringing
them into the criminal justice system and
[SPEAKER_00]: persecuting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're out here working hard
to try to stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the legislature, one
legislator introduced a bill to amend this
[SPEAKER_00]: to include medical marijuana as an
exemption from the recriminalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Representative Amy, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was Representative Amy from here
in southeast Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my neighborhood, in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tried to amend the bill to include
an exemption for people with medical need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposition said, well,
you know, that's a separate issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to debate medical marijuana if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so actually, they stopped the debate
by saying that we have to debate it on
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they never let the bill on
medical marijuana get a hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no way to ever have the
debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in one of the committee hearings,
Representative Menace of Wood Village here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Portland area promised
Representative Amy as a way to stop the
[SPEAKER_00]: debate on amending the bill to include a
medical exemption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Menace, a Portland police detective
sergeant, promised Amy that he would allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical marijuana bill to have a
hearing in the Judiciary Committee in the
[SPEAKER_00]: House.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Representative Menace lied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he never allowed that bill to come up
for a hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just used that as a ploy to stop the
debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He obviously doesn't care what happens to
these medical users at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's a police officer, and he wanted
to expand his power and to help his
[SPEAKER_00]: cronies in the police department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the sole reason for this
bill, the governor said as he signed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has less to do with the possession of
marijuana as it does with expanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: police powers of search and seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the real reason they're doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to send them a message that
that isn't going to be tolerated,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we Oregon voters aren't going to let
that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that by getting this
petition and signing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out in public and you see
someone who is petitioning, go up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them to sign the petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out there looking for work or
you know someone who's looking for work,
[SPEAKER_00]: urge them to call us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get this petition out there and
we need to do it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number is 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet some of you have that number
memorized by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't, it's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your help to be able to put this
on the ballot and get this issue before
[SPEAKER_00]: the voters and stop the recriminalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I was going to say it is really
simple to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you need to do is sign at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is your petition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you make sure you have the right
county in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you want to do is ask,
like Donna said, are you registered to
[SPEAKER_03]: vote in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll answer you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to their answer,
you have them sign the right county.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all you really got to do is
make sure they're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Secretary of State will be happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get to have a little chitchat.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people do realize the benefits
and are proud to sign this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even many people who don't use marijuana
themselves know others that do use it
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinally or recreationally and don't
believe that those people should go to
[SPEAKER_01]: jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what strikes me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives me really a lot of hope to know
that people realize that sure,
[SPEAKER_03]: they may not want to take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may not want to take aspirin,
but I think it should be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here in the Portland area in
gathering signatures, you often have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have three different counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the primary counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Multnomah, Clackamas,
and Washington counties, the tri-county
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside of this area, if you're in
Corvallis, you've got Lynn and Benton
[SPEAKER_00]: County because the boundary of the county
is right there on the Willamette River.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're down in Eugene Lane County is
where you're going to get most of your
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real key is that on the petitions,
there's a little box in the upper corner
[SPEAKER_00]: that's blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you write the name of the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everyone who signs that sheet
needs to be registered in that county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to be registered to vote in
that county or else their signature
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really count.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get another one to make up for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you've got your signatures,
you need to make sure you fill in this box
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the circulator statement saying that
you circulated this petition and that you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe the people who signed it are
registered voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to put your address in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is the easy way to do it,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've noticed a lot of people,
they come up and they're really excited
[SPEAKER_03]: about signing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So their eagerness, they just start
writing their name down anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why it's really good just to be
careful what county they're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make certain they sign the
right county sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you're registering voters,
they can't sign at the same time that they
[SPEAKER_01]: register.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes time to process their
registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually when I'm at Saturday Market,
when I register voters, I tell them that
[SPEAKER_01]: when their card comes in the mail,
come in and sign then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with people who want to petition,
lately we've been paying people to
[SPEAKER_00]: petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is I have people go down the
county elections office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, that's just a little over a
mile away from our office in southeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go right into the county
elections office in your county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Portland, it's at southeast 11th
and Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other cities, it's usually wherever
the county government's based out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go into the elections office and they
will stamp your voter registration card
[SPEAKER_00]: and give you a certificate right there
showing that you are registered to vote
[SPEAKER_00]: from that time forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as soon as it gets into your county
elections office, you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating the petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign the petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get active on a basis that is
useful for our political movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, that phone number is
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outside of the Portland area,
add one 503 to the front of 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're real happy to send out the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act petition to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an article in The Lancet,
which came out in December of 1995,
[SPEAKER_00]: called The War on Drugs and
Decriminalizing Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That article, the very first sentence of
that article said, quote, the smoking of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, even long term, is not harmful
to health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's one of my favorite quotes,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a peer-reviewed medical journal,
one of the most widely respected medical
[SPEAKER_00]: journals in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been coming out for 200 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the oldest medical journals in
the world and the oldest one in the
[SPEAKER_00]: English language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first sentence of this article,
an editorial by their head editor,
[SPEAKER_00]: was the smoking of cannabis, even long
term, is not harmful to health,
[SPEAKER_00]: end quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: That article ended with another quote that
I just love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, quote, sooner or later,
politicians are going to have to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: running scared and address the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, per se, is not harmful to
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But driving it further underground may
well be, end quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Oregon, our legislature has taken
a move to drive cannabis further
[SPEAKER_00]: underground and we have a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the power of referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the power of referendum and we
need to get 50,000 registered Oregon voter
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures to put this on the ballot and
we need you to vote no on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same time, we need 75,000 registered
Oregon voters to put the regulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: taxation of cannabis and legal medical
cannabis and legal industrial hemp on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that, but we need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, call us, 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty much wrapping up,
ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you'd like to say
to folks in our closing minutes here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being active, being an activist,
really has some really good adventures and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best way to meet people I know
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually met some friends through
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beneficial, not only for oneself,
but for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just ideal that if you're
stressed out about something, like you're
[SPEAKER_03]: afraid the police are going to kick in
your door or something, then it's better
[SPEAKER_03]: to do something about it, not just sit
back and watch TV and become a part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: norm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can if you want to, but it's all about
this should be a free country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to thank you folks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you to call us one last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't memorized it yet,
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been another exciting edition of
Cannabis Common Sense, a program that
[SPEAKER_00]: tells you the truth about marijuana and we
urge you to tune in next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
Check it out.
