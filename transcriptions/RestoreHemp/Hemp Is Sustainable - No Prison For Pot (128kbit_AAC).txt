[SPEAKER_01]: Industrial use, you know, I don't see
there any harm and there's a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: uses for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, people fight it because of the,
well, from the back-balling of it through
[SPEAKER_01]: William Randall Person's paper industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's where it first started,
but I don't mind the industrial use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it makes fine rope, fine clothing,
fine paper, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can make out of a
hydrocarbon, you can make out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to be burning fossil
fuels when we don't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can grow hemp that
[SPEAKER_03]: contributes to sustainable agriculture,
because the tonnage of carbon removed from
[SPEAKER_03]: the air in the form of carbon dioxide is
high relative to the amount of carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: removed from the air by other plants like
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a modified 1983 Mercedes-Benz
turbo diesel, and the only thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done differently is put lots of
wonderful stickers on the car and put hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: biodiesel fuel in the tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No modifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Mercedes-Benz right now has a model
420M series, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got hemp composite plastic
dashboards and door paneling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're discovering that it
biodegrades when it breaks upon impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't break sharply, so it's less
likely to injure a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've, let's see, we've been on the
road for six weeks now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got 6,000 miles on the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally on hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got another six weeks to go,
roughly, before we end our tour in D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of problems that have to be
solved, and this can solve a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fiber strength is up on the order of
5,000 psi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get a fiber strength that's
equivalent to some of the toughest,
[SPEAKER_03]: strongest woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you process hemp fiber using a
hydrogen peroxide process, you can control
[SPEAKER_03]: the pollution more effectively than using
chlorine processing, which is used for
[SPEAKER_03]: paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hemp that comes out of this process
can be made into oriented strand board.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oriented strand board is the largest
growing sector of the materials industry
[SPEAKER_03]: for construction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oriented strand board can be made with
hemp fiber, having a modulus of 6,000 psi.
[SPEAKER_03]: About twice the strength of ordinary
particle boards.
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes hemp fiber bonded with its own
natural binders, a suitable material for
[SPEAKER_03]: underlayment, sheathing, and roofing
substrate in houses and housing
[SPEAKER_03]: construction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
