[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really pleased to be here at HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first HempFest, and I live in
Detroit, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am here to tell you, first of all,
Michigan has 200,000 medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: patients registered in less than four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so things are really happening in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan has reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a medical marijuana card from
any other state, you are protected under
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan law up to two and a half ounces
of personal possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, if you were growing 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just telling a story to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they called me, I said,
well, I should tell this story on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been practicing marijuana law for 25
years, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the last 10 years, I've really
been concentrating in it to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where five years ago, I had a straight
marijuana practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at that time, all the marijuana law
in Michigan was criminal defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we had, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felonies, misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, do not consent to any
searches, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Fourth Amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been practicing criminal defense
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, we get the
medical marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea that was going to happen
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I happened to be in the right place at
the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I jumped on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I formed the law firm of Cannabis Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tomorrow, you'll probably see me
wearing the t-shirt with my logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there are four lawyers in our law
firm at Cannabis Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we represent dispensaries and
businesses and also people who've been
[SPEAKER_00]: busted, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the story I was going to tell was that
we needed a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so real estate is cheap in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're giving stuff away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was lucky enough to find this
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to drive by it every day on my way
to work at this office I used to rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted $1 million for this
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I got it for about a tenth of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point of the story was this
building used to be a radio station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the radio station in Detroit was WWW.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, in the 70s, it was a
rock and roll radio station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, Howard Stern was a DJ who got
a start there in Detroit at W-4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Stern story is that W-4 changed
their format one weekend from rock and
[SPEAKER_00]: roll to country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Howard Stern came to work on Monday
and said, I am not playing country music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the short version is I ended up
buying that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the studio that they used as the
broadcast studio has turned into the
[SPEAKER_00]: medication lounge for our clients who are
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come to Detroit, you can come
into the lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Steinway grand piano in there in
1920.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tuba, a trombone, a ukulele,
a harmonica, a guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a sixth string that I
bought for my 50th birthday that I never
[SPEAKER_00]: learned to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple other musical
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll invite you all to come to Detroit
and to Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here as the representative of
Michigan Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the executive director of Michigan
Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people say, oh,
we shouldn't have a lawyer as the director
[SPEAKER_00]: of Normal because, hell, he'll be out of a
job if we legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's working against his own interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't get a job doing anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we need to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started a petition drive this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed 323,000 signatures in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with 54,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mistakenly thought that volunteers would
get up and do this work to just repeal
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't happen that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm not as good a marketer as I
need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to raise a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planning to do that in the next year
or two and do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking for Washington and
Oregon and Colorado to lead the way in
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing marijuana so that the rest of
us, so that we can see a wave across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm in Michigan, which is just
an island in the middle between Rhode
[SPEAKER_00]: Island and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't a whole lot of medical
marijuana friendly states yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Arkansas is on the ballot this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some other states that are
on the ballot this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody needs to make sure that
you're registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vote to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to some really good
music here this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew Abel from Michigan Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come on to Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
Peace out.
Peace out.
