[SPEAKER_00]: You know it was about two years ago that
Jack two years ago yesterday that Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herr gave his last speech from this stage
Jack Herr wrote a book called the Emperor
[SPEAKER_00]: wears no clothes right here in Portland
back in 1985 we call this stage the Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herr stage and You know today is also 9 11
so it was 10 years ago that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people died back on the East Coast and So
we're coming up on 420 and we just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember a couple other people Dr. Todd
McCarey also got to talk from this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote a book about Cannabis and Ben
Mazzell a famous Wisconsin activist spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: on this stage last year and he passed away
earlier this year from cancer So I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to give anybody a bummer here at 420,
but we're here to mark important occasion
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we want to see hemp restored Hemp
is one of the oldest crops grown by people
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody agrees that marijuana was among
the first few crops that people started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at least 12,000 years ago and It
produces more food Protein that meets
[SPEAKER_00]: human nutritional needs better than any
other protein out there it produces more
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel biodiesel fuel from its seeds and
ethanol from its leaves and stalks And
[SPEAKER_00]: from these hemp stocks, and this is the
official hemp stock of hemp stock here
[SPEAKER_00]: three years old it from the stocks It
produces more paper more fiber more
[SPEAKER_00]: building materials than any other plant so
We're here to legalize hemp and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it through an initiative petition
There's a petition booth right over there
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to urge you guys if you're
registered to vote To sign the petition if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not registered to vote now is The
time we've got to take control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you can't stand around and say
winter They're gonna legalize marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're never gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have to do it You know It's
gonna take us all working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna happen you know unless we
all get out there and Represent and
[SPEAKER_00]: educate so I urge you to sign the petition
if you can get some signatures on the
[SPEAKER_00]: petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some petitions over there and You
know I want to hope you're are you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you know it's less than a minute away
according to my clock, so You know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: here for freedom and liberty, too You know
our right to our freedom of consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: to be happy Here on this planet is one of
the other things we're fighting for you
[SPEAKER_00]: know right now There's really a rapid
growth in genetic technology And gene
[SPEAKER_00]: information there's rapid growth in
nanotechnology as they miniaturize all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of things There's a rapid growth in
artificial intelligence Within a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: our lifetimes a lot most of you guys out
there Computers are gonna be pretty darn
[SPEAKER_00]: smart, and if we don't protect individual
rights Then the future is dire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know things like the matrix and the
terminator are possibilities so We have to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect our right freedom of consciousness
and expand natural individual rights And I
[SPEAKER_00]: think marijuana is a bellwether issue on
that the the fact that They've taken the
[SPEAKER_00]: oldest crop the one that produces more
fuel more food more fiber and more
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine than any other plant And they
made that one illegal It's wrong So we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to get active.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm counting on you happy 420 and We'll be
back restore him You
