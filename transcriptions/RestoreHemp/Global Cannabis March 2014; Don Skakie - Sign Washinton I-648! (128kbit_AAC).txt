[SPEAKER_00]: I bring you warnings from Washington,
you know 502 Pass they said it was
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization We have exchanged criminal
prohibition for an economic one They have
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbed the power of the plant away from
the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no home growing unless you are a
medical patient if you are If you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed grower into the state system you
can't even sample your own product This is
[SPEAKER_00]: an iron grip on cannabis that we have got
to move past We have got initiative 648 in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington this year It's going to
legalize home growing at the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: limits for anyone 21 and older without tax
fee license permit and most importantly
[SPEAKER_00]: Registry if it's a legal product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have to go on a government
list in order to have it Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: we fix a couple other things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Right now under 502 if you're under
21, hey, I'm over 20 minutes legal I can
[SPEAKER_00]: have an ounce if you're under 21 you go to
jail the first step the first arrest
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be a ticket if you're under 21 over
18 You go see the judge if you're under 18
[SPEAKER_00]: you go with your parents and figure out
what's up Maybe your folks don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're gonna have it legal,
we don't want to be arresting young people
[SPEAKER_00]: And putting them into jail with thugs and
criminals and molesters when we need just
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them into court with their parents
Gonna fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gotta tell you last legislative
session When 502 passed they didn't they
[SPEAKER_00]: they said oh we won't affect medical at
all We want to affect medical the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing the liquor board tried to get shoved
in there was to put medical into a system
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not even exist yet This is
problematic because so many patients
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on their medicine I see what's
happening in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've mixed the systems there I think
that's a bad move rec should be
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational medical should be medical
When patients need their medicine and go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a place and find the rec users have
bought it all up Or driven the prices up
[SPEAKER_00]: so high that they can't afford their
medicine What have we done?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got to do this right in the coming
ten years This country is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what will that legalization look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you be able to grow for yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or will you be forced to go pay an
exorbitant tax and face arrest if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't or should you be able to grow your
own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Share with your friends and family just
like you do the bounty of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Know this is Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the global mark Tell your friends
in Washington sign 648 and Something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're gonna get some video out
of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like and the March It's a
great piece for about a 30-second sound
[SPEAKER_00]: bite on the news What happened in
Washington was our lobbyists claiming to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent our industry They were
representing their own special interests
[SPEAKER_00]: our people Wore red shirts sat in the
legislature upstairs in the gallery at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the session right up to the last
few minutes They couldn't decide on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill medical We stopped them and we
stopped them by not just getting the sound
[SPEAKER_00]: bite the video We registered patients to
vote We got patients that had never talked
[SPEAKER_00]: to their legislators before To write them
emails make phone calls go into their
[SPEAKER_00]: offices and put a face on medical There
were legislators that said oh 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical people are fakes They're just rec
users that just want to smoke pie Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell you something I'm also here
to speak for patients like William Kurtz
[SPEAKER_00]: who has a degenerative hereditary disease
and I gotta tell you at 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that I know in Washington Don't
get out They can't afford to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are physically unable to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are too ill to get out So we need to
put our face in front of the legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to make sure that they know that
medical is legitimate that Recreational is
[SPEAKER_00]: not harmful, but the two must go ahead
separately to protect the best interests
[SPEAKER_00]: of the state And of the people and of the
patients Make sure you're registered to
[SPEAKER_00]: vote sign these initiatives and before we
get to the vote Start on your legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a voter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in your district.
[SPEAKER_00]: I voted for you You represent me and
medical makes a difference to me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: community Tell them what the law should
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sit around and wait to vote on it
You are the government the government is
[SPEAKER_00]: not you Make them change the law to
represent what we want for cannabis You You
