[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start over here with the new
nutritious hemp milk, which is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in plain vanilla and chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any plain here to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually distributed from here in
Portland, Oregon, but it's made up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver, British Columbia, or up in the
British Columbia, Vancouver area anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really a tasty, new,
very nutritious item out there that has
[SPEAKER_00]: all the omega-6 and 3 that most of our
diets are lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next over, we have a Park Davis bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pint bottle of cannabis
tincture, one of the half dozen Park Davis
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see cannabis right there products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right here is the pride of the THCF
medical collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our oldest medicinal cannabis
bottle from the 1840s from London.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was introduced into British
pharmacology in 1839 by William
[SPEAKER_00]: O'Shaughnessy, a Scotsman, who brought it
back from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called it cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the early bottles that they
used to store it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real big bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that holds a gallon or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1840, our oldest bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next door, we have a 1880 cannabis
tincture bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here in North America, they call
these things lugs or label under glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they put the label under the glass
and then put glass on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the terms for these type
of apothecary bottles, a lug bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nifty little cap, and you'd see
that in your pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one here, the last one that
will bother you with tonight, is a
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction that was done by the British
Pharmacological Society in 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a nifty little cap,
and you'd see that in your pharmacist.
