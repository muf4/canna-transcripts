[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm watching the Super Bowl and I see
that they're saying people like me are,
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to like mowing the lawn and
having some nachos, also murdered a family
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colombia, I take offense to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else takes offense to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not murder a family in Colombia and
it is the people that are propagating the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that are responsible and they're
gonna keep on, I can't even imagine how
[SPEAKER_00]: many families are gonna die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of our drug war in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: War on drugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a break, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attention, drug war generals out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are fighting back, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike you, drug war generals,
we are nonviolent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are peaceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot and will not stop us because we
are not criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna make that mean something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to take our country back and
put it in the hands of the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: founded this country, the hands of the
people whose blood and sweat and tears and
[SPEAKER_01]: backs paved the way for us to be here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that in our justice system,
we've got too much emphasis on the system
[SPEAKER_01]: and not enough emphasis on the justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ain't gonna make it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly why we're here today in
Seattle, Memphis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you came out and we'll be vocal
day after day after day, year after year
[SPEAKER_01]: after year until we've overcome and
justice finally prevails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
