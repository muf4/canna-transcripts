[SPEAKER_00]: Get registered and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1972, I had gotten involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 32 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got into an argument with a guy about how
much he charged me for some pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said it was a nine, and even I said
it was a six.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got into a fight, and he made up this
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book became the best seller in the
United States in the underground market in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1973, in 1974, people walked up to me
and said, Mr. Herr, I was 33 years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Herr, did you know that they used to
make paper for marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked down at my lid, and I just
couldn't picture how they made paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was from Buffalo, New York originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do that back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing is somebody came up,
a 19, 20 year old kid going to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you know, they used to use hemp
for sales and clothes, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had barely ever heard the word hemp
before in my life, and usually it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kept growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I wrote this book, people thought I
must know something about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, 1973, early 73, I probably
couldn't identify a pot plant if I
[SPEAKER_00]: stumbled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1973, I met a guy named Captain Edward
Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He owned a head shop in Los Angeles called
Heads and Highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they had eyes, another one would see
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: By himself, this guy, in 1973,
decided that when they were collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures to put California marijuana
ship on the balance, he decided the unpaid
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteer initiative, he decided to open
the store 24 hours a day, seven days a
[SPEAKER_00]: week, and he'd get people 50% off if they
bring in off a water pipe, off a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we were with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Captain Ed, in 1972, opened this store
around the clock and did something no
[SPEAKER_00]: human being had ever done before that I
have ever heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He collected 140,000 signatures from his
two stores in the San Fernando Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: one third of all the signatures that were
collected in the state of California to
[SPEAKER_00]: put the marijuana initiative by volunteers
on the balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds of petitioners came out of his
store to go out, come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd give them some bucks off something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd smoke them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they didn't have a place to sleep,
he'd sleep them in the back room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hell of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't believe it had worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steel, and it wasn't the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: government or the Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a ragtag bunch of people that
basically look like we do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, as I'm telling you this story,
in 1972, he opened this store.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it his business.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than the other 200 head shops in
California, 300 record stores from the
[SPEAKER_00]: change that all had cleared the petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd got more signatures than all the
other four stores in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 500 stores in the state that
carried the petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one store, he got more signatures than
all the other stores in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made believers out of people that never
thought they could believe in the power
[SPEAKER_00]: that one person can bring forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you out there that might know
Captain Little Bear at some point in his
[SPEAKER_00]: life, he was the most remarkable person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took me, a polyester kid, a salesman,
brought me in, turned me into a hippie,
[SPEAKER_00]: grew a beard, and he would go to marijuana
meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the California marijuana, this is 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 72, let me tell you about California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In June, when it qualified the ballot for
the ballot, the initiative had 9% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vote, about 81% against it, and 10%
undecided.
[SPEAKER_00]: As July and August and September and
October came, the numbers went up small,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10%, 12%, 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Halloween, just before the election in
November 1972, with the ever-popular
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard Nixon running for the president,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had 19% of the vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thought we would get
slaughtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had discounted the marijuana
movement, the barefoot hippies that had
[SPEAKER_00]: collected the signatures, and no money
movement, nothing behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 34% of the vote, and that blew
politicians away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And state after state, Oregon,
Alaska, California decriminalized
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana because of that vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they only started with 9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, when they qualified in June,
it was put on the ballot by hippies that
[SPEAKER_00]: knew when you went out to petition as a
volunteer, there's nothing wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: making money petitions, but if you're a
volunteer that you're gonna go collect
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures, go collect the signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your words should be as good as your
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't collect them, put up some
money to the organization that is
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting them, and let them use your
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 50 cents, 60 cents, buys a
signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put up $10, you bought 20 signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought somebody standing in front of a
supermarket collecting your signatures for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a decent way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put up the money, somebody else
collects it, the signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the greatest story in the world
to tell besides pot getting you well,
[SPEAKER_00]: besides it being one of the greatest
medicines and the safest medicine on
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing safer you can put in your
body than marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will live longer if you smoke pot
every day of your life than people that do
[SPEAKER_00]: no drugs at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll live eight to 24 years longer than
people that use alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll enjoy music more, you'll stress out
less, you'll come home from work,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a bowl, and eat both that
executive's two-week vacation at Puerto
[SPEAKER_00]: Vallarta, where he's always fucking and
fighting with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he charged too much of this,
and they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get some water back there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get some water back there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can one of you guys get me some water?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a volunteer petitioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you were one of the volunteers,
thank you, darling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were one of the volunteer
petitioners, thank you,
darling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were one of the volunteer
petitioners, thank you, darling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were one of the volunteer
petitioners, thank you, darling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were one of the volunteers,
thank you, darling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were one of the volunteer
petitioners, thank you, darling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty short shrift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often didn't have lawyers to fight for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, in 1973 and 74,
as those people came up to me and told me
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could win the ballot, that we
could get the signatures, and I thought we
[SPEAKER_00]: could do it voluntarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried probably 15 times in various
states, mostly California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed the ballot until with Dennis
Perrone last year or three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected the signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got him a ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won a very liberal, very, very liberal
medical marijuana in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got headaches, you've got
stress, you've got backaches, you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: dampness, you can get a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part about giving a note in
California is the federal government has
[SPEAKER_00]: threatened doctors with a loss of their
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't taken one away, but they've
scared the hell out of the doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few doctors will give you notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you think of all this work that
people have been doing, the reason you can
[SPEAKER_00]: sit here and smoke a bowl, if you ask me
today, is because it's decriminalized in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's decriminalized because about a half a
dozen or a dozen people here, including
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Connolly, Mollins, voter power,
these people which you just barely know,
[SPEAKER_00]: went out and collected signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the Oregon legislature recriminalized
[SPEAKER_00]: it, we were at the Rainbow Gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out and collected signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left the Rainbow Gathering,
stowed it over mine on July 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what we were doing July 3rd,
but they signed it on July 4th when we
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to come to stay in Oregon,
not go back to California, and collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures, put it on the ballot,
stop the law from going into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have 90 days to stop the law from
going into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seldom, seldom used.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we went 90 days, we collected the
signatures, stopped the law of Oregon from
[SPEAKER_00]: recriminalizing marijuana down to a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they could take your education,
your car, and your kids, go right home
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, if they find a joint in your car
now, they must pay you a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they find a joint in your car under
that new law, they could take you home and
[SPEAKER_00]: search your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went and we decided we had no time
to talk it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had 90 days for one of the law
passes on a referendum to stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few states had referendums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said we were losing the papers
and reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said we were losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put out a medical initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recriminalization was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it came up to a vote eight months,
nine months ago in November, 98,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people thought we were going to
lose early on in that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wound up winning by 66%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was happy to say fuck the Oregonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he put you in jail, take away your
right, it's a sloppy newspaper for a
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana, in case you ever have to defend
it, don't forget it is the greatest single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant on our earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it, three and a half billion
plants and one plant is greater than all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other plants that grow under combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just one at a time, like the King Kong
over a retinue of other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plant can make all the paper,
all the fiber, all the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isn't it nice we have something to
stop fossil fuels?
[SPEAKER_00]: To stop poison plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another way of living on earth,
but it takes you to register to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes you to register to vote and to
vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you move, re-register and get
everybody around you to register and
[SPEAKER_00]: re-register and re-register and vote on
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be things you might not want
to vote for or against.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll find a lesser of evils,
at least a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day you'll have things on the
ballot like initiatives that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in and you can actually do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cancel out some Gestapo type brain
who wants to vote in a synthetic future
[SPEAKER_00]: for mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you live longer if you smoke pot than
if you do no drugs at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live eight to 24 years longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight to 24 years longer, as I told you
before, than people that use alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often tell this driving story.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're driving down the freeway and
you're straight and you go to miss your
[SPEAKER_00]: exit, you go, well, let me get over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cross three lanes and you get
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're drunk and you go to miss your
free exit, then you get over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You blindly cross another couple lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're stoned and you're bored and
you go to pass your freeway exit,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I usually see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get off the next exit, you stop at the
Burger King.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drive safer under marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% of all those studies have shown it
over and over and over again, and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: never been able to replicate their
negative study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make all the paper, fiber,
fuel, food, which is for protein on earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier than any other single food on
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't stand up and fight to shut
those guys up, they can't shut us up at
[SPEAKER_00]: court.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't shut us up in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't shut us up at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stand and tell your parents,
tell your brothers and sisters and uncles
[SPEAKER_00]: and aunts, friends and acquaintances,
and the guys sitting next to you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never stopped forgotten tired of
telling the story of how to win your
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You register and vote and you vote and you
vote to learn about the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned about this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a book about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you read the
[SPEAKER_00]: book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the healthiest and best thing for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it needs you to fight for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't get up and fight for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's given us its knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's given us its incredible advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finest paper from corrugated box,
the finest fuel, the best oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number one protein source on earth and
the highest probability you can relate to
[SPEAKER_00]: the essential fatty acids your body must
have of all the foods on earth and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: clean your blood better than anything else
on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only people it needs is us and all
of the us that we know to be taught this
[SPEAKER_00]: information over and over again and in a
reputable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, I ask you to join me at
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask you to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of initiatives floating
around California, excuse me, Oregon right
[SPEAKER_00]: now to get on the ballot for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not my preferred words,
but I signed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They belong on the ballot if we have
nothing else to put on the ballot because
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets the information out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can teach this information
comprehensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are 80,000 of us in prison in
America, in jail in America, a million and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half on parole and probation for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get them all out of prison,
all out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to write the records clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until that happens, we haven't won this
war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can rest on their laurels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a soul and we care,
you're going to do or give something every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it might be big as it might be for
the marijuana movement, I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends have, and because of it,
I think a lot of us are a little bit freer
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Oregon, in California,
than we would have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Captain Ed, wherever he is,
and for me, Jack Hard, I want to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Condy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For having this event against the police
powers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you should think that a lot of
people were scared to stay here,
[SPEAKER_00]: come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're here, Bill's going to have
a tough year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have lots of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need lots of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what the solution is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he asks for support, run away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he has supported this movement and
this state so well for 15, 16 years that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't do better than Bill Condy
for helping save the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a booth over there next to Bill's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about three over from the elephant,
above the elephant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember to go register and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then remember to teach all your
friends that are 18 or older, register to
[SPEAKER_00]: vote right now and ask them the question
until they get tired of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you on the house?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
