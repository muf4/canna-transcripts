[SPEAKER_00]: The national drug control strategy
proposed by President Bush and drug czar
[SPEAKER_00]: Bennett isn't worth the environmentally
disastrous and unnecessary sulfuric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: and dioxin laced wood pulp process paper
which it is printed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, the continued prohibition of
hemp marijuana cultivation prevents our
[SPEAKER_00]: society from utilizing nature's premier
renewable resource for the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth's paper, fiber, fuel, food,
paint, and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, at the time of George
Washington, he and all American farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: were required to grow and could even pay
their taxes with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hemp was used for the majority of
colonial Americas in the world's paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing, towels, diapers, lace,
sails, canvas, Dutch pronunciation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, rope paint, varnish,
lighting oil, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, as recently as World War II with
Philippine and Asian hemp cut off by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture in 1942 produced
a 14-minute black and white film,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp for Victory, encouraging and
instructing patriotic American farmers to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow 350,000 acres of hemp per year by
1943 to be used for civilian and military
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes, rope, fire hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the parachute webbing that George
Bush held onto when he bailed out over the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific was made from cannabis hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp uses the sun more efficiently than
virtually any other plant on our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, on a planet-wide, climate-wide,
and soil-wide basis, hemp, grown annually,
[SPEAKER_00]: would produce approximately 40 times the
biomass that is living organic matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: the next best annual rival biomass crops
that can be grown on Earth, such as corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: cunuff, and sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have the ability and the
mechanized technology to use hemp biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: and other biofuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ability and the mechanized
technology to use hemp biomass and other
[SPEAKER_00]: biofuels for energy farming and produce
all of the clean, renewable fuel we would
[SPEAKER_00]: need for all of our cars, homes,
and industry with a net reduction of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretical computer models have shown
that reversing the greenhouse effect will
[SPEAKER_00]: only be possible if possible at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If hemp and other biomass wastes are used
again as they were until 130 years ago for
[SPEAKER_00]: making the overall majority of Earth's
paper, fiber, fuels, paints, and now
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from plastics to dynamite.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for marijuana, the blossom of the hemp
plant, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: government clinical studies as well as
studies of the Jamaican, Costa Rican,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Greek marijuana using populations
indicate statistically that you will live
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a year longer if you smoke
marijuana every day than if you use no
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs at all and 8 to 24 years longer than
regular tobacco and alcohol users.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1987, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: government statistics reported 395,000
Americans died from tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: 87% of all lung cancer cases were caused
by tobacco use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the National Institute of Drug
Abuse, that's NIDA, reports 125,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans died in 1987 from alcohol use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same agency, and the Surgeon
General's mortality statistics report zero
[SPEAKER_00]: ZERO deaths ever due to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of October 1988, no case of lung
cancer has ever been attributed solely to
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we at hemp are seeking a
marijuana hemp armistice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an immediate nationwide moratorium
on the personal medical and industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the President and Congress to
immediately appoint a hemp advisory
[SPEAKER_00]: commission to oversee and expedite
reintroduction of hemp to American
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, business, and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our justifications for this moratorium
commission are that with few exceptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the American public, especially
our politicians who should have known when
[SPEAKER_00]: they made these laws, the judges who
should have known when they enforced them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the police and even the teachers who
should have taught them and all the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of us in the first place knew virtually
anything any of the preceding history,
[SPEAKER_00]: facts, information, or the vast potential
of hemp as Earth's premier natural
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable resource, biomass, and life
extender.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have to go to jail for fighting for
that, or give of any other part,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you should, you should be proud to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, such a sweet thing as marijuana to
go to jail for, put there by people that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even know this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't the foggiest idea, and yet
chemicals, petrochemicals, fossil fuels
[SPEAKER_00]: are totally legal in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the greatest things, if not the
greatest natural growing thing on Earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every damn politician out there should be
ashamed of themselves forever if they
[SPEAKER_00]: continue this now that they know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've heard it and they don't believe
it, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's true, you better change your
ways because if a world would accept you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to live in that world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the world doesn't accept you,
you should be proud of a world that would
[SPEAKER_00]: teach you how to behave like adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you want kids to behave, like to be
responsible, to control their uses,
[SPEAKER_00]: we expect you to control the abuses of the
power of legislating stupidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: ignorance, and the end of my planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
