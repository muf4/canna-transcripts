[SPEAKER_00]: That was done even 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have water pitchers and things we did
made with 20, 40, 55% hemp fiber into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic beads that are used in these
injection molding machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of it turned out pretty brittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp CD cases, all of mine are broken
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hemp scale is, I think that was the
electronics and not the hemp that failed
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all these little tchotchkes got made
from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually it makes your beads
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp is cheaper than polyester so they
can mix the two together when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making the beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually is a pretty good fill
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That technology is available right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My problem with that is that they're
selling that as hemp plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp plastic is a whole other thing
where you actually take the hemp and turn
[SPEAKER_00]: it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasticize it itself, and you can do this
with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the hemp fiber and the hemp seed
oil are these incredible plastic parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: very much like bakelite in the end,
just from hemp alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you add some perforins and things like
that, you get amazing fiber things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be our future because
these things are biodegradable without
[SPEAKER_00]: killing us and all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll learn one of these days to use hemp.
Thank you.
