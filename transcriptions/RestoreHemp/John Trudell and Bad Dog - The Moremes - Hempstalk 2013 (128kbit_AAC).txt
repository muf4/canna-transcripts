[SPEAKER_00]: There's me There's the other me There's
another me And then there are the more
[SPEAKER_00]: me's We've all got a domino to play So
we've been trying to work it out We don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how your life turned Or what all that
means But me and the me's We've already
[SPEAKER_00]: seen what we couldn't do And we're not
going back Any skeletons in our closets Or
[SPEAKER_00]: our own private stash of bones There's no
scream like the last scream And that
[SPEAKER_00]: scream with no choice Reducing the present
into nothing While eternity is now not
[SPEAKER_00]: then Who's divided into what And how many
does that make There's love that loves
[SPEAKER_00]: There's love that fears There's love that
possesses There's love that needs proof
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the love that likes Love that
cares There's no forgetting Some realities
[SPEAKER_00]: destiny threw at us And fate wasn't much
help With its weight of loading the load
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was up to us to carry it And we
didn't have any say
[SPEAKER_00]: In the land where the lie is king Using
fear like glue Pretending, pretending
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't pretending Each and every one of us
have saw the glories Each and every one of
[SPEAKER_00]: us want the glories But we don't like the
way we fall And sometimes straying is a
[SPEAKER_00]: way of walking When we can't stay Because
we've been accused Of some things we did
[SPEAKER_00]: And some things we didn't do And we heard
our forgive you's that lied So me and the
[SPEAKER_00]: me's Have been looking for a me That will
answer to me But so far there's no one who
[SPEAKER_00]: will There's me There's the other me
There's another me And we've all got a
[SPEAKER_00]: domino to play So we've been trying to
work it out
So we've been trying to work it out We've
been trying to work it out
