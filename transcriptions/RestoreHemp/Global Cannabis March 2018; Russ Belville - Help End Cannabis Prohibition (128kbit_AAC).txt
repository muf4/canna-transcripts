[SPEAKER_00]: How?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Radical Russ Belville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the co-partner in Delta Nine House,
Portland's 420 friendliest Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also the host of the Marijuana
Agenda podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out on iTunes and all other
outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've traveled all across North America
these past 13 years fighting for the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of adult marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to say it is a beautiful day
to be here in legal potland in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you're thinking, though,
marijuana is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we got to march about?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this march first started in 1999,
there were no legal states and there were
[SPEAKER_00]: only five medical marijuana states.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started doing this march in 2005,
two out of three people nationwide opposed
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, two out of three people nationwide
support the legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nine legal states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 29 medical marijuana states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 17 CBD-only states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're down to just four states in America
that have absolute cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've made a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But folks, legal ain't equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal ain't equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still lose our jobs for smoking
legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still have our gun rights denied
for smoking legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still have our children taken away
for us for legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still have no public place where we
can gather with other adults and smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks, legal ain't equal in our
personal lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And legal ain't equal in our business
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to quote my friend Jody Emory in
Canada who said, we thought legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: meant the existing marijuana industry
would be made legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding a legalization industry
that's squeezing out the family farmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's squeezing out the minority
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blacks and hippies did the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because whites and yuppies are making the
dimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we need to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard a lot as we were trying to
legalize marijuana about treat marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat marijuana like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But legal alcohol can take business
deductions on their taxes that legal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana can't take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal alcohol doesn't have to worry about
its bank accounts getting closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But legal marijuana does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And legal alcohol doesn't have to worry
about federal interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But legal marijuana does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal ain't equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially on this Cinco de Mayo,
when right down there at Tom McCall
[SPEAKER_00]: Waterfront Park, the place is packed with
parents and children at a place that is
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored a three-day outdoor drinking
festival sponsored by Modelo Especial
[SPEAKER_00]: Corona Extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Modelo and Cerveza Pacifico that you
can drink right out in the open in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right here in Pioneer Courthouse
Square for our marijuana festival,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legal ain't equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also insisted that legalization should
not harm medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said it three times in Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the state doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Denying out-of-state patient cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steep reductions in growth sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invasive tracking and inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complex regulations and exorbitant fees
that are driving growers out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: These drastic changes to the medical
cannabis program are unconscionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This state charges $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the highest fee in the 29 states
that have medical marijuana for a sick and
[SPEAKER_00]: disabled person.
[SPEAKER_00]: To join a medical marijuana program that's
always run a surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always run a surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the state goes and diverts money
from that surplus to balance the budget of
[SPEAKER_00]: other failing bureaucracies, then has the
gall to come back to our growers and say
[SPEAKER_00]: they gotta pay, what is it, 40 bucks a
month for some invasive tracking program?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so messed up that they're driving
growers out of this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are marching today because we got it
legal, but legal ain't equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal ain't equal to the OLCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so afraid of pot that they have
devoted only twice as many resources to
[SPEAKER_00]: the minor decoy operations, the stings,
try to get underage buys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twice as many to alcohol as they did to
marijuana, but there are 10 times as many
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol outlets as there are marijuana
outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're shocked when they come
back and find in the past five decoy
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, 100% compliance on the
marijuana side, but they have nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: say about the fact that in the last five
alcohol decoy operations, one out of every
[SPEAKER_00]: eight teenagers was successfully able to
buy alcohol with a real ID with a red box
[SPEAKER_00]: around their head that says they're not
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat marijuana like alcohol, we ought to
treat alcohol like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seem to be doing a much better job of
controlling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And legal ain't equal to the Oregon Health
Association either, the Oregon Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so fearful of gaming the system
that they've turned the system into an
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive game that most growers don't
wanna play anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're upset when our patients who
can't find any return to the unregulated,
[SPEAKER_00]: untaxed underground market that OHA was
passing these laws to try to eliminate in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, legal ain't equal to the
Oregon legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: How else can you explain a clean air act
that bans indoor smoking because we proved
[SPEAKER_00]: secondhand tobacco smoke was harmful,
but then it's amended by the legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: to include cannabis vapor, which has never
been proven to be harmful?
[SPEAKER_00]: A clean air act that offers an exception
for cigar bars to allow tobacco smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: but doesn't allow an exemption for
cannabis smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal ain't equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, what the hell good is a right
if you got no place to exercise it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're marching today because we want our
equal rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deserve to be treated with the same
decency and respect as any cigar smoker,
[SPEAKER_00]: any beer drinker, any whiskey chugger,
any chewing tobacco user.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deserve equal rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If society's figured out how to
accommodate the beer drinkers and
[SPEAKER_00]: accommodate the cigar smokers,
they should just apply those rules to us
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any place I can smoke a cigar,
I should be able to smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any place I can do a shot of whiskey,
I should be able to do a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you with me?
