[SPEAKER_01]: When the Vietnam guys started coming back
To the VA and they would send them to a
[SPEAKER_01]: psychiatrist and the psychiatrist would
say to you Well, so you've been playing
[SPEAKER_01]: cowboys and Indians over there someplace
and now you want some sort of sympathy or
[SPEAKER_01]: something a Prescription for Valium for
two weeks and you'll be all over it Guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got him hooked to Valium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They popped him in the nose for the value
but at the same time they They give the
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans morphine like drugs
antidepressant type drugs Valium like
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs and and it causes the veterans to
turn into alcoholics or suicide or Some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of crimes or another and the Veterans
Administration is literally destroying
[SPEAKER_01]: right now 2.5 million people who who
fought in Iraq and Afghanistan Two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half million and they're just people
they're wrecking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about medical marijuana and
PTSD and PTSD absolutely and and I
[SPEAKER_01]: estimate that there are probably about 1
million of the veterans of recent wars who
[SPEAKER_01]: have PTSD And at least half of them above
a scale of five and those are the ones who
[SPEAKER_01]: are desperately in need of Marijuana
therapy those those are those are the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones who are less than five can
probably get by on something less Than
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, but marijuana is the best drug
we have found so far for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_01]: PTSD and within the last month I just
wrote a article that that marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: prevents PTSD suicides and I got about a
thousand comments on it from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: country we and I was in the military,
but I didn't see combat but I Do know as a
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana user that when I smoke
marijuana, I don't have dreams Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when I quit using marijuana after a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I start to have some very vivid
dreams Yeah, so obviously marijuana will
[SPEAKER_01]: help that is one of the worst symptoms of
PTSD and You probably wouldn't imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: what the second most important something
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that not being able to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your worst experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about your worst experience That
just like so did you feel that way after
[SPEAKER_00]: World War two?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you went through a lot of very
traumatic experiences and my fighting your
[SPEAKER_01]: way into Germany meeting up with the
Russians there My first day I was I was I
[SPEAKER_01]: was committed to combat I Got I got an
artillery artillery barrage that just blew
[SPEAKER_01]: the hell out of this little town where I
was and the next day they hit me with a
[SPEAKER_01]: murder with a mortar barrage And when we
crossed the Rhine River, I got strafed by
[SPEAKER_01]: German planes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get strafed by American planes We lost
150 men in less than an hour out of how
[SPEAKER_00]: many 150 out of our battalion Battalion is
what about thousand about a thousand so
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 out of a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty heavy nutrition.
