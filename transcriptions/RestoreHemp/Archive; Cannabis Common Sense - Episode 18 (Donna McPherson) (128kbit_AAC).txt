[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for Cannabis Common Sense,
the show that tells you the truth about
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and the politics behind its
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, the host of your show,
to tell you the truth about marijuana and
[SPEAKER_01]: the politics behind its prohibition,
let's welcome Paul Stanford.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you may know, Cannabis Common Sense is
a production of our political committee,
[SPEAKER_02]: Campaign for the Restoration and
Regulation of Hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's CRRH for short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are aware, we are circulating a
petition and a referendum at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The petition, our initiative, is the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would license farmers to grow the
drug, marijuana, for sale to the OLCC.
[SPEAKER_02]: The OLCC would sell it through its liquor
store system and put it in bars and
[SPEAKER_02]: taverns that got a license to carry it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would also put it in pharmacies at
cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would tax the recreational use of
marijuana through the liquor stores,
[SPEAKER_02]: the bars and taverns and smoking
establishments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the marijuana sold through the
pharmacies would not be taxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be with the doctor's
prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're registered to vote,
we need you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get our petitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign the petitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign the referendum.
[SPEAKER_02]: The referendum is different from the
initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a legislative bill that was enacted
by the legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't gone into effect yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will recriminalize the simple
possession of under an ounce of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has been legal here in Oregon for
the past 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 years since 1973.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we get enough signatures by early
October to put this on the ballot for a
[SPEAKER_02]: vote in November of 1998, then the law
will not take effect in October of 1997,
[SPEAKER_02]: as it's currently scheduled to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be held in abeyance and its
eventual outcome would be decided by the
[SPEAKER_02]: people in a vote in November 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help to get signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're registered to vote, give us a
call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you aren't registered to vote and
you're living in Oregon, register to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you don't vote, the people who
want to put us in prison will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're outside of the Portland area,
dial 1-503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to welcome Donna McKerson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back for another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming, Donna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Donna is a long-time activist,
the treasurer of Portland Normal,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Portland's branch of the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal is proud to announce that we
register more voters than any other
[SPEAKER_00]: organization in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would like to register you if
you're not registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the initiative campaigns in
Oregon actually have registered more
[SPEAKER_02]: voters than the Democrats and the
Republicans combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're out there in the streets
contacting people and registering our
[SPEAKER_02]: constituents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to get them out to vote
so that we'll have a bigger impact on the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire political process, not just the
drug policy debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I tell people, if they bust you,
they don't care whether you're registered
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better be registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you might be able to have some
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are busted, you can still
register to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in other parts of the country,
you can't register to vote if you've been
[SPEAKER_02]: convicted of a felony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people here in Oregon are
under the misperception that they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: register to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the people I like to register the
most when I'm out in the street
[SPEAKER_02]: petitioning are people who don't think
they can register to vote because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you run into that, Donna, where people
said, I can't vote, and say, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time that I have collected
signatures at one of our events,
[SPEAKER_00]: people will come along and say,
well, I really wish I could sign your
[SPEAKER_00]: petition, but I'm not registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, we could register you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I can't register.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a felon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Oregon, felons, well, not in jail,
but when they're on probation or parole,
[SPEAKER_00]: after they've served their time and done
their debt to society, they can register
[SPEAKER_00]: and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And should do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be affected by laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have definitely a say in
producing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have access to the web,
you can get our petitions right off the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet on your own home printer,
assuming you have an inkjet printer,
[SPEAKER_02]: or with waterproof ink, or a laser
printer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just print them right there in
your home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to wait for us to send
them to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our web address is www.ca.gov.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Donna, you've been a member of a
local club called the Alternative Health
[SPEAKER_02]: Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a club that allows the
medicinal access to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though it's illegal currently,
the people who are running the club,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're not really involved on that
level, but the people who are running the
[SPEAKER_02]: club are taking a great risk to
themselves, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they certainly are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, running the club, you are as far
as the police are concerned, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: distributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could be arrested for
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they believe that it's so important to
get marijuana to people who need it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's worth running that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're running that risk every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as are their patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know quite a lot of the patients at the
Alternative Health Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your heart goes out to these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of them have cancer,
are in chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've lost their hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've lost, I've met a man the other day
who had just had his arm removed two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: previously because he had had cancer in
the bone right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people with AIDS are there who
are taking, you know, people with AIDS
[SPEAKER_00]: take a real large number of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new proteus inhibitors evidently are
doing a wonderful thing about their effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on the AIDS virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also make people really sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can die from that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call that the wasting syndrome for
people who have AIDS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many AIDS patients say the only thing
that helps keep them alive where they can
[SPEAKER_02]: increase their appetite is by using
cannabis and marijuana to combat the
[SPEAKER_02]: wasting syndrome that accompanies the use
of all those pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also an appetite stimulator for
people who are undergoing chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_02]: with cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: People who are undergoing cancer treatment
find that by using marijuana, it
[SPEAKER_02]: stimulates their appetite for that week
after chemotherapy when they can't keep
[SPEAKER_02]: anything down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stops nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are several different
medicinal products in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's THC or Tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC is the substance that combats nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stops nausea, increases appetite,
lowers inner ocular pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other, and it's actually
available pharmaceutically, but for oral.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Marinol, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Marinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's available pharmaceutically,
but taking it orally is really difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're nauseous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll throw up three or four of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those pills are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I've heard they're very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cost $6, and the big ones cost $18 or
$20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're so sick and you throw up
three or four $20 pills, you better either
[SPEAKER_02]: be rich or have a good health insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, in the case of a lot of
people, they don't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they find that by just taking two or
three puffs of good marijuana that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to keep food down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're able to keep liquids down,
and they're not throwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what THC does, and it lowers
inner ocular pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the most psychoactive
ingredient in cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's another constituent of
cannabis, cannabinol, and that is CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And CBD is just slightly psychoactive,
not so much as THC, and it is an
[SPEAKER_02]: antispastic agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people who have multiple sclerosis find
that that portion of the chemical mix in
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, that helps them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people who have multiple sclerosis,
anything that causes them to go into
[SPEAKER_02]: spasms, they find that use of CBD is very
useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is not pharmaceutically
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only available in the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also one other constituent of
cannabinol, of cannabis or marijuana,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's cannabichromy, or CBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBC is not psychoactive at all,
but it has an anti-infection property.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lowers temperatures for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stops the onset of fever and has some
other medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis isn't just one or two
constituents.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a variety of them, and a lot of them
have different medical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know several patients who either have
multiple sclerosis and are in wheelchairs
[SPEAKER_00]: or have had injuries and are paralyzed
from wherever down.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person I know particularly is
paralyzed from the waist down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that if you are in this situation,
you have spasms in your limbs that you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot control, and also that pain can
suddenly strike anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidently, if you interfere with the
spinal cord, you have no control over what
[SPEAKER_00]: the nerves are going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that smoking marijuana, he said,
is better than any drug he'd ever taken
[SPEAKER_00]: for both calming the spasms and for making
the pain go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, we at the Campaign for the
Restoration and Regulation of Hemp are not
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with the Alternative Health
Center, the club here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also clubs in other parts of the
country, especially in California now with
[SPEAKER_02]: the passage of Proposition 215 that
allowed medical marijuana down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we refer people that ask about it to
the club, and we don't have a problem with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are happy to see a patient that needs
this to have access to this medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wonder why the state has imposed
itself between the doctor and the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would you prefer to decide your
medical issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should it be your doctor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should it be you personally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or should it be the police officer who
wants to seize your property because you
[SPEAKER_02]: might own a house?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the answer is pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with the recriminalization of
marijuana bill that's passed, that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: circulating a petition to try to stop,
the police said that this was their number
[SPEAKER_02]: one priority, the top priority that they
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the murderers and rapists and
thieves out there, they're making this
[SPEAKER_00]: their top priority?
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they solve those problems?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that doesn't happen anymore in the
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have murderers, robbers?
[SPEAKER_02]: My God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arson here and there?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know here in Portland that if you have
your house robbed or your car stolen,
[SPEAKER_02]: police don't even visit you anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They send you over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was really disappointed in
Governor Kitzhaber.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I voted for him, I thought he was a
progressive Democrat who had good ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: about what to do with this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my impression that he had decided
to veto this bill because the state
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can't afford to keep the libraries
in Portland open, it can't afford to
[SPEAKER_00]: employ the amount of teachers it takes to
teach our children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't afford to create more shelters
for domestic violence victims.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that the state could not afford
to incarcerate a bunch of pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the governor thought that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to him?
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran into the governor when I was down
working in Salem and lobbying against this
[SPEAKER_02]: bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor told me personally when I ran
into him at a coffee stand, I was there to
[SPEAKER_02]: get an espresso drink, a drug,
at the drug stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an open-air drug market right in
front of the state capitol.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were selling caffeine beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra strong ones sometimes, I bet,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get whatever strength you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want double-dose, triple-dose?
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll sell them to you at these open-air
caffeine markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor was there in line waiting for
his caffeine-laced drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was going up to get my caffeine-laced
drink, my coffee, espresso, mocha,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't drink coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drink mocha.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't resist this rare
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who could resist, Paul?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to stop this
recriminalization bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I would never get to see the
governor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't let me see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run into him at the coffee stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, Governor Kitzhaber, this was early
April.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Governor Kitzhaber, I'd like to
take this opportunity to urge you to veto
[SPEAKER_02]: House Bill 3643.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it hadn't been passed by either
house of the legislature at that point,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it looked pretty certain to pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of different interests
that were backing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone in the Republican Party,
and they held control of both houses,
[SPEAKER_02]: unanimously supported it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one Senator Lim out in Gresham
opposed it, one Republican.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the governor turned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, and he goes, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Governor, I want to urge you to
veto House Bill 3643.
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor said, well, which one is
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, that's the one that would
recriminalize possession of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor got his drink from the man he
turned around and he looked at me and he
[SPEAKER_02]: says, you know, we really don't have the
money for that, and I'm going to veto it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, we really don't have the money
for that, and I'm going to veto it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, the governor claimed that
he reluctantly signed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said it wasn't because of
possession of marijuana, but that,
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact, it was to expand the police
powers of search and seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we need to send a message to the
governor and the legislature, and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: do that by getting our petitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the referendum petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you the referendum.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get 50,000 good registered
Oregon voter signatures by October 3rd of
[SPEAKER_02]: this year, 1997.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we do, it'll stop it from going to
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not much time at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be seeing this show in
September.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we don't get enough signatures by
then, we're still circulating the Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Tax Act, which would legalize the
sale of marijuana to adults over 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would allow doctors to prescribe
marijuana to patients through pharmacies
[SPEAKER_02]: at cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would tax the recreational marijuana
that's sold in liquor stores and bars and
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would also legalize industrial hemp
so that farmers can grow industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: for production of thousands of different
products, everything from paper and fabric
[SPEAKER_02]: and building materials from the stems of
the marijuana plant to oil for food and
[SPEAKER_02]: energy and protein from the hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, actually, hemp produces more
fiber, protein, and oil than any other
[SPEAKER_02]: plant on our planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've taken this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows more in the temperate and cooler
climates than any other plant on the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire planet, and they've prohibited this
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, I believe that that is truly
evil to take a plant that produces more
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber, protein, and oil and say,
oh, you can't grow that one, folks,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we want to sell you petroleum.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to sell you pesticide-laced
cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to cut down all the forests and
build building materials.
There.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what really bothers me is to think
that they're not only cutting down trees
[SPEAKER_00]: for timber and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're cutting down trees to make
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make better paper from hemp than
you can from wood anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a renewable resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to grow a crop for 60 years
and have streams running through it and
[SPEAKER_00]: animals living in the trees and all that
and then cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow it like wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it rejuvenates the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, hemp has a very long tap root,
and it draws up subsoil nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the leaves fall off and go back
into the soil, it brings those nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: up from the minerals below and puts them
into the soil for other plants to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very good plant for breaking
soil and for revitalizing soil in a crop
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will grow anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen hemp growing in a swamp
condition in China.
[SPEAKER_02]: In China, in fact, they invented paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2,000 years ago from hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first cloth and textiles were made
from hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: All archaeologists agree that hemp was one
of the first plants purposely cultivated
[SPEAKER_02]: by man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are three other plants that they
can't distinguish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one was the very first one?
[SPEAKER_02]: But all archaeologists agree that hemp was
definitely among the first plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're talking about the plant that
perhaps agriculture was invented to
[SPEAKER_02]: service bins need for hemp for both
medicine, protein, fiber, and oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant that produces more of this
protein, fiber, and oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that's just a travesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant that's as useful as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wonder why.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would make it illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it baffles me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the American Medical
Association actually went into Congress in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1937.
[SPEAKER_02]: A doctor wooded and testified that they
should not criminalize hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cannabis had many medicinal
properties and that what they were saying
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana caused, at the time they said
smoking any marijuana would cause you to
[SPEAKER_02]: go crazy and kill your family and friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually laid out documents that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the doctor, the lobbyist for the
American Medical Association, told the
[SPEAKER_02]: congressional committee that that's not
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That those things aren't so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he opposed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And several legislators harassed this
doctor and told him he shouldn't be trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to stop lawmakers at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it came to a full vote in
the House of Representatives, one senator
[SPEAKER_02]: from that committee stood up and lied and
said that that doctor had supported the
[SPEAKER_02]: bill when in fact he had opposed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it passed without debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds a lot like I've made my mind is
made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bother me with the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was August 2, 1937.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it is just over.
[SPEAKER_00]: A day of living in infamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are a little bit more than 60
years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're facing a drug war.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's the winner in the drug war?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there are any winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any sign that there's going to be
a victory yet after 60 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, you see the patients in the
alternative health center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're facing arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in danger of going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, these people are sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of care is there going to be for
them in jail?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe that they're going to be
able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much is it going to cost to care
for these people in jail?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many wheelchairs do they keep
in jails?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they want to take them in there and
book them and possibly sentence them to up
[SPEAKER_02]: to 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 days if they have an ounce or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if the patient can't afford to go and
buy marijuana in the black market and they
[SPEAKER_02]: happen to be growing one or two plants,
well, it's escalated, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a class A felony.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same as murder, rape.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worse than manslaughter, rape,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the equivalent of murder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those people have their homes taken
away, have their property seized.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're convicted felons.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to go through drug treatment and
diversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a very horrible system,
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to send a message to
politicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do that by calling us and
getting the referendum to stop the
[SPEAKER_02]: recriminalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a referendum on House Bill 3643.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to get 50,000 signatures by
early October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get 75,000 signatures by July
of 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get enough signatures, then they're
both on the ballot in November of 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call at our office here in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also download it off the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a newspaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you come down to our booths,
we're at the Portland and Eugene Saturday
[SPEAKER_02]: Market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at various events.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be at the Byte.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be at the Byte here in Portland in
mid-August.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the Rose Festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at the Rose Festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be at the Rose Festival next
year, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The recriminalization petition,
as we're going to tape here in early
[SPEAKER_02]: August, has only been out for about three
weeks now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we urge you to give us a call and get
in touch with us and get our petitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the only way we're going to make a
difference is if we get out and show the
[SPEAKER_02]: support by putting these things on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I urge you to call us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't delay, because the next door to be
kicked in may be your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always amazes me, the things they say
about what, like you were saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking marijuana makes people crazy,
and they were going to kill their friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call that reframing us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people in this country have
smoked marijuana at some time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 20 million?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, 20 million, they estimate,
are regular monthly users or greater.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the total number, I think,
of people who will admit to it is about 80
[SPEAKER_02]: million, or almost half the population
admits that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Bill Clinton said he puffed but
didn't inhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Newt Gingrich says he smoked marijuana
for some period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe Al Gore and Tipper Gore inhaled
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when they were college students.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people didn't ruin their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't start killing their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know that that's a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even those of you who don't smoke
marijuana yourselves, you know somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just people, like anybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have children.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, some studies show that marijuana
smokers have a higher incidence of on
[SPEAKER_02]: time, at just job performance,
being at work on most days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-marijuana smokers actually have a
higher rate of absenteeism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's indicative of some of
the propaganda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people find that hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why they don't report it very
much through the mainstream media.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact of the matter is that the
media manipulates, certain groups
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulate the media, particularly the law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people and the folks in the drug
treatment industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that makes me think.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the referendum, I believe that one of
the things is mandatory drug treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug treatment industry is going to
make a lot of money from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to be behind supporting this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it requires a mandatory
diversion project for anyone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: convicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have your license suspended for
six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're under 18, you don't get your
driver's license until you've turned 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't matter where you've been
arrested with marijuana to have this
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be in your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those laws are in effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take away your driver's license
and make you go into diversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have up to 30 days in jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll seize your property.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a terrible system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to change that by
circulating the referendum and the Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once again, I want to urge you to give
us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us put the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us stop the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the main people who are
controlling the black market are kids and
[SPEAKER_02]: users, substance abusers, by and large.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who abuse other substances besides
just marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the reason that marijuana is
labeled by some as a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a gateway, but it's a
gateway to the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we take marijuana out of the black
market like they have in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_02]: then the rate of use of all drugs is going
to decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to a survey that was quoted in
the British Medical Journal back in
[SPEAKER_02]: December of 1995, it's called
Deglamorizing Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that article said that the rate of use
of marijuana in the Netherlands by people
[SPEAKER_02]: who are 16 and 17 years old, people who
have legal access, because in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Netherlands you can buy marijuana when
you're 16 years old, that the rate of use
[SPEAKER_02]: is less than one-fifth what it is here in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's obviously indicative of the fact
that prohibition isn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want you to get our petitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to thank you for calling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being on the show, Donna.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get our petitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us stop the drug war before they kick
in your door.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tune in next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
