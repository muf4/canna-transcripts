Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only been two years and she already
hates my dog.
She's been up and down the street like we
don't understand the law.
And I'm finding for some time where I
ain't looking at the face.
And every time she talks to me,
I'm staring at
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look the victim seems to serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can this call me for
me?
You ain't never been this way.
I
like victim seems to serve.
I
[SPEAKER_01]: grew up in the country where no
[SPEAKER_00]: one would keep me safe and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she tricked me into crawling out and
now I'm working on her bar.
And I can't stand.
We look the victim seems to serve.
I grew up in the country where no one kept
me safe and warm.
