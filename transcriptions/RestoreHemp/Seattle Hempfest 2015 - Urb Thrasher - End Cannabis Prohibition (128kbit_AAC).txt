[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving to wake you guys up this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Superball of the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This event right here is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday was a great day, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to turn it into a positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw many people and it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little bit of weather and no one
cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are freedom fighters and we
don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we care about is what we smoke and we
care about our freedom at these rallies
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, my name is Irk Thrasher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also Scott Gordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much going on in the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love being a part of this
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Oregon and we just recently
legalized in November and it was freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of it was because of you
Washingtonians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're teammates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we watched you guys in 2012
legalize and we choked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden we came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watched you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our legislators learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came and bought your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden we came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem I'm seeing right now is
that we're proud of Measure 91 and you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys aren't proud of I-502.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to turn that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you guys will come into
Oregon, buy some of our weed, continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy Washingtonian weed and keep educating
your legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great medical program through the
years and we kept teaching these guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: they saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understood weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understood what it meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're in our next phase,
which is equality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we legalized and now it's time
to equalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that, you know, is getting a
job without pissing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys like pissing in a cup just to get
a job, just to get a paycheck,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to support your family, do whatever
you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of jobs out there
doing that even in Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and Oregon where we're freaking
legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bullshit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't tolerate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, speaking to any of you guys
watched the presidential debate here
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, the Republican debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got a bunch of legalized
states and it wasn't even mentioned once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crap right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a bunch of states in
2016 voting for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't mentioned once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was one cool thing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Dr. Ben Carson, everyone's all
fired up about him right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said one cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking at the end and he was all,
well, you know what, I'm in the operating
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm operating on the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not operating on their skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's right about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what else doesn't tell?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pissed when they piss in a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell who that person is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just tells what he might have smoked
two weeks ago, three weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't tell who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crap right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No urine tests, especially in legalized
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the insurance companies are pushing
that crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own a business, please don't urine
test anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start changing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start talking to your buddies when you're
at your business meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out who is and tell them to stop that
crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want jobs too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of jobs, I'd love, you know,
one of my things too, I wear a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 420 Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Portland Normal because activism is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys need to be involved in groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep activism going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urbeys Designs right down here at 425.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please support the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many vendors, so many bands lost their
slots on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of money, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: This event isn't free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the donation boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make up for Friday and take care of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see some creativity in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still see a lot of dabs and bongs,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensaries, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's be creative, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen a lot of creative stuff,
but let's keep being creative to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: growing this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can find me at Earp Thrasher on
Twitter, 420radio.org, urbeysdesigns.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, keep supporting these
bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the sponsors right here,
Cavie Gold Records, has a great band today
[SPEAKER_00]: playing at 4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole area right here will be rocking
today at 4, and that's Lotus Crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one of many bands that you
guys can be supporting that support this
[SPEAKER_00]: community, that support music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been living, we've been smoking
in our basements all these years listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to this music.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep supporting these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to Vivian McPeak,
all the Seattle Hip Fest crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharon Winston, who runs the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rachel, speakers, you guys rock!
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
