[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the Global Cannabis March.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really big day for all of us
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 19th anniversary should really be a
kickoff for something great, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: because cannabis has come so far in the
last year, let alone the last 10 years or
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know that there are a lot of
people that made this happen through the
[SPEAKER_00]: years that are not here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, everybody's not been able
to see this wonderful thing come to
[SPEAKER_00]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks may ask also, well what the
heck are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, you know, Oregon, you guys can
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you even marching?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because they're not from here and
they don't understand the struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been working tirelessly,
I mean seriously, since the 80s with
[SPEAKER_00]: people like Paul Stanford, Paul Loney,
and of course Dr. Phil Levesque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Levesque passed away three years ago
today on Global Cannabis Day, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect day of course for him to decide to
go through another door.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he did for Oregon and for the United
States and for the world is hard to put
[SPEAKER_00]: into any kind of synopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a brilliant man that absolutely did
not ever, ever give up to his dying day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he was a kid and he graduated from
high school, he went to University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon and got a bachelor's in chemistry
and what did he do after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He went and joined the army in 1944 and
became a scout in the army, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most dangerous jobs there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to him and Patton's army
crossing the Rhine, he was able to secure
[SPEAKER_00]: and liberate Americans and people that had
been, you know, accosted by that terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: war for years and he came home alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he also came home with was a terrible
bout of PTSD and he couldn't talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the war for decades, decades, not to his
kids, not to his wife, not to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it finally broke free about 30,
just over 30 years after the war,
[SPEAKER_00]: then he was able to start reaching out and
helping other veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Oregon that meant helping veterans get
off of narcotics and the terrible drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were going, that they were
using, even alcohol in order to combat the
[SPEAKER_00]: demons that they were suffering from PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Levesque, through his work in
Oregon and fighting with the legislature,
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of the guys that made it possible
for veterans to have access to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine that would make them healthy and
not kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1998, Doc fought real hard in 99,
you know that it became legal for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2004, Dr. Levesque had 5,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the doctor in Oregon that had
signed more cards than anybody else,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that put him in the spotlight,
the target for problems with the
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities, problems with other doctors,
other doctors that wanted to keep their
[SPEAKER_00]: patients drugged up and under their care
and instead Doc was freeing them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible, you know, drug addictions,
so that got him in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2005, he actually lost his license to
practice and after that he became even
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger voice for legalization and for
medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never stopped one day under any
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: They beat him down, but they never,
never got him down and he always came back
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger than he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would like to do is dedicate
today and this stage again to Dr. Philip
[SPEAKER_00]: Levesque and I know if he was here,
he'd have a lot more to say about what it
[SPEAKER_00]: means to him to work with all of you guys
and you know that really you are his
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy, all of us are, and it's up to us
to keep this momentum going stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to reschedule, we need to
deschedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this thing over with,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do it for Doc Levesque and for
Jack Kerr and for everybody else that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have lost that were the big fighting
warriors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be their warriors, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to us now, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, and so only one last thing about
Doc and those of you that know him know
[SPEAKER_00]: that his last words would be, don't smoke
in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have to ask, don't ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask, don't ask, don't ask.
