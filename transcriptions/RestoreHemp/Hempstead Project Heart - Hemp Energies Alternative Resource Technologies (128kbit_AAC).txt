[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a couple more songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to say this before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to check out, if you can
remember this, HempsteadProjectHeart.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't Google it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go to that little address
thing up there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But HempsteadProjectHeart.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want to, we're, anyway,
some of us, we're of this attitude that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time to seriously consider hemp as
alternative energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: With its own identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where we're at with the pot and
the medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hemp is earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medicine for the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want the THC people to start saying
and making it known in a coherent,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-argumentative way that it's time to
consider hemp as alternative energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go out there and make it heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way the medical marijuana people
make themselves be listened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way the gays and lesbians make
themselves be listened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the hemp people to make themselves
be listened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would check that site out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you agree with what we're about,
then act on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, then that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
