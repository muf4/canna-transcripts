[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a science nut and I look at the
endocannabinoid system the marijuana like
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that we make and I look at how
they participated in evolution to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point that we have humanity and we have us
standing here and sitting here talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and what that direction means is
and shows is that we have to increase our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid activity that's the way nature
has occurred up to now and now we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to self-reflect see how we got
here and know where we can go and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why it's totally unstoppable it's just a
matter of time because what we're doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: the natural evolution of life on this
planet and the critical role that this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has in being able to tweak our
endocannabinoid system and to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: world of people who are more high rather
than having it run by people who are less
[SPEAKER_01]: high yeah yeah
