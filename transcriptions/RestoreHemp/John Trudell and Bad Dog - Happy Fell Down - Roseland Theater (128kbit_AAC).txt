[SPEAKER_00]: Then happy fell down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broken pieces of shattering love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glimpses of what once was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwhelmed by what is, what if,
and what could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, it didn't seem like much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then each stone thrown had an
accumulative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they hit or missed, each thrown
stone became a part of the wall they
[SPEAKER_00]: built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning quarrel into ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Losing balance turns habitual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else's truths are someone else's
lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: During those wars of scars, old wounds
keeping time, waging battle in the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's when love is blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it opens its eyes, it can disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality of what is happening is not
diminished by their unwillingness to
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is them who diminish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then happy fell down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broken pieces of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then happy fell down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broken pieces of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
