[SPEAKER_00]: Well I want to pick up a little bit on
what Chris started with and that's about
[SPEAKER_00]: the institution of media and the function
it serves in society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there I want to talk about a
few stories because that's the frame in
[SPEAKER_00]: which media operates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no question that there are
people who lie, as Chris pointed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you have with journalism is an
institution that has a core value of a
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment to truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the pursuit of the truth and the
inquiry into the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the story it's who, what,
where, when, why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's specific information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be tested, it can be questioned,
it can be verified, and it can be proved
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is the written word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a reference that can be
looked back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some ways it's similar to law and
policy which work in a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: written area of operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is if there are
publications that are not telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth and there is evidence to the
contrary, the institution itself will
[SPEAKER_00]: critique and check and they will lose
credibility and they will lose legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is those news organizations that
are bringing valuable information and
[SPEAKER_00]: telling the truth that are actually
raising everybody's consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of a baseline within
journalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you have that there's still a
question of what is going to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the Los Angeles Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I swear it seems like every week
there's a story about how the national
[SPEAKER_00]: forests are an environmental disaster zone
because of all these drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what's happened is because
of asset forfeiture the grows have moved
[SPEAKER_00]: into the national forests where no
property can be seized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often run by Mexican gangs and
they're armed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not taking care of the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes it is an environmental harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the story is never about why we have
illegal grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this assumption at least in Los
Angeles where there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: eco-consciousness that it's just an
environmental story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you move along and the next week
there's a story about the violence in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico and how this is all caused by the
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there isn't this recognition that the
story may be about the drug prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: has exported this violence across the
border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that there are no secure property
rights for people who are trucking in
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore the only way they can secure
what's theirs is with violence because
[SPEAKER_00]: they have no legal protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is discretion within journalism
about the way that you are going to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also further there are questions
about what media is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to tell a story that people are
going to be interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to pick three stories that in
my experience in drug policy became very
[SPEAKER_00]: big stories and a little bit about why
those things seem to happen the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is rewind a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with the entertainer Drew Carey at
the Reason Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we launched a video journalism project
working with Drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the initial videos that we
released was on medical marijuana in
[SPEAKER_00]: California with Drew Carey as the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: We released the video the week that he
became the new host of The Price is Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this story got picked up by the
Associated Press and multiple news
[SPEAKER_00]: channels and it was printed in local
papers pretty much all over the country
[SPEAKER_00]: because here's The Price is Right which is
daytime TV America and what makes it an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting story is the host is talking
about marijuana, this subject that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: else can talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the combination of things made it
surprising, made it more interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: as we would say it made the story blow up
because we're generating stories all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know which ones are going to
become hits, which are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to spread like wildfire because more
people are interesting in hearing those
[SPEAKER_00]: stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second story I wanted to talk about
that actually blew up was the case of a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary operator in California named
Charlie Lynch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charles, if you've met the guy or you know
the guy, he's like a choir boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soft spoken, upstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he opened his collective,
he called the DEA to ask for guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to open a dispensary in accord
with state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: He contacted the city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor of San Luis Obispo attended the
ribbon cutting for the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The president of the chamber of commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was a very stable citizen and very
conscientious about his community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the conflict happened and the raid
came and he was facing federal charges,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially if convicted on all counts he
had the potential to have what would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been a life sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This became a significant story because it
captured that Charlie Lynch because of who
[SPEAKER_00]: he is and how he worked was a sympathetic
victim of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that story, it became a bigger
story because of that and because he had
[SPEAKER_00]: done the things with the chamber of
commerce and the mayor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that make people go,
wait a second, that seems wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the story has more impact that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the story then got picked up by Al
Roker, picked up by others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that was just because of the
news cycle and Charlie's trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time it was all finished,
he was found guilty of the charges that
[SPEAKER_00]: were placed against him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when the judge came to do
sentencing he said, look, this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: operated in good faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made these efforts and his sentence is
going to be three, he didn't even give him
[SPEAKER_00]: the mandatory minimum sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave him one year and one day for the
three guilty convictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far better outcome than was expected when
this all began.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most recent story that we were around
that just blew up was a story about a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: raid in Columbia, Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen this video on
YouTube, but it's from the perspective of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Columbia, Missouri Police Department
and they began just filming what was a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard practice SWAT raid on a home and
it's at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police go in, it turns out a family
lives there, a husband, wife, seven year
[SPEAKER_00]: old kid, dog, and they're asleep so they
break down the doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all per procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shoot the dog with the kid there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dad's like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: They found, I mean like they found a very
small amount of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like nothing was even in the,
they didn't even find anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going in with guns blazing with
a family there and I really, in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: it blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to one, it was like 1.3 million
views on YouTube in the space of a few
[SPEAKER_00]: short weeks because it shows so clearly
what is going on and no procedures were
[SPEAKER_00]: violated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was by the book but it caused the
police chief of the town to change the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to operate going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I hate the internet because the
transparency that the news media provided
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case showed what is the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no need.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time delay between when they
got the warrant and when they conducted
[SPEAKER_00]: the raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a high stakes, high speed,
we gotta get there fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have gone at any time of day
and in fact they could have just knocked
[SPEAKER_00]: on the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was talking with Neil Franklin,
the new head of LEAP and he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I was in drug prohibition from
the police side.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you can't flush that much pot
down a toilet that fast if you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: warrant and you just show up at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were three stories that went big
but it was because they were individual
[SPEAKER_00]: people and you could see the victimization
or you could see what makes it an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting story and as somebody in media
that's what we are always looking for is
[SPEAKER_00]: the interesting story that is true that
conveys information in a new way for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that I'll say thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
