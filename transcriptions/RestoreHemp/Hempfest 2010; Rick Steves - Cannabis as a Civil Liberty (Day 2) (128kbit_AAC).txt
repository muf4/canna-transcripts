[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up to Rick Steves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in a lot of places, but I can't
think of a better place than right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle Hemfest, beautiful August day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well as Vivian said, I'm a travel
writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, high is a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sweet place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sweet place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sweet place where my speakers sound
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly I'm a good cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversation slither like stray cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place sometimes I want to visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, our government says we can't
go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today there's 80,000 Americans doing time
in prison because they wanted to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: that place called high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are times when our government
can say we can't go there and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if our government says we can't go to
a place, there better be a good reason we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no reason we can't go to high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the responsible adult
recreational use of marijuana is a civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: No apologies necessary, it's just having
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's a drug and I don't want to
promote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to promote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to change the law that says
people who want to enjoy it can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to acknowledge that it's not
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can mess you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for children.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drive intoxicated by anything,
they should throw the book at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to get it anywhere,
we need to acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our government is fighting a war against
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perpetual expensive losing battle
based on lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's costing our society billions of
dollars of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's locking up hundreds of thousands of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year 800,000 Americans get arrested
for marijuana and then they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I bring to the equation is a European
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent a third of my adult life in
Europe and in Europe a joint's about as
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting as a can of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have a drug abuse problem in our
country and Europe has a drug abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: problem in their country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can learn from each other and we can do
a better job minimizing the harm that drug
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse causes our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, they've learned that if you
have a drug abuse or a drug policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should be motivated and assessed not by
how many people do you lock up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but by how does it reduce harm to your
society?
[SPEAKER_00]: Harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Europe, they're into pragmatic harm
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they've found is that if you take
the crime out of the equation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can treat drug abuse as a health
problem and an education challenge and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can help your society minimize the harm
that drug abuse causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the United States is really into
legislating morality and Europe has
[SPEAKER_00]: learned that that does not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's futile.
[SPEAKER_00]: My European friends tell me that a society
has to make a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tolerate alternative lifestyles or
you can build more prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, we're building more
prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Europe, they've learned that you
can tolerate alternative lifestyles and
[SPEAKER_00]: the result is we've got more people in
prison than any civilized country in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lock up eight times as many people per
capita as Europeans do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either we are inherently more criminal or
there's something messed up with our lives
[SPEAKER_00]: and today we can sort that out and we can
explain that to our society in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what shapes American drug policy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reaper madness, generations of lies
and fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to take the scariness out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, this group here is kind of scary
to people who are most afraid of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to solve the problem by
being more scary in their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to solve the problem by
explaining things to them in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: lets them not be afraid If we want to get
anywhere in this struggle, we've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop being scary and being reasonable and
let people know that there's not a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir of people wishing they could
just ruin their lives with drugs if only
[SPEAKER_00]: it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there think that if
marijuana was legal, everybody would smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you, in Portugal they
legalized the consumption of all drugs ten
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use doesn't go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who wants to smoke pot is already
smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just take the crime out of the
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Americans who are afraid of
marijuana say it's a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the Netherlands, they've not
locked up a pot smoker for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a track record.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about drug abuse just as much as
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they like their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took the crime out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they realized is their hard drug
taking pot regulation is not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young people can experiment with marijuana
and not be buying it from criminals on the
[SPEAKER_00]: streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, if there's anything gateway
about marijuana, it's its illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it's illegal, you can only
buy it from criminals on the streets and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got a vested interest in getting
you a now more expensive, more addictive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more profitable drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want marijuana to be a
gateway drug, then legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this Hymn Fest is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great celebration of the cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're going to legalize marijuana,
we've got to get serious and mobilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're all understanding this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all hip to the fact that there's
nothing dangerous about the mature adult
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our government needs to understand
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to help our government
understand that is to support advocacy
[SPEAKER_00]: groups that are fighting your battle and
my battle in the state house and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are waging dogged struggles on small
budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not supporting them with a
few bucks, you're not helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a board member of normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a board member of normal for 10
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got great respect for the work that
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: These advocacy groups are not charities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are services and they're doing our
hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at a crossroads today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at an exciting crossroads where we
can actually make some difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Prohibition in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine what it was like in America when
they realized, hey, that the laws against
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol are causing more problem than the
alcohol itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Courageous people stood up and explained
that to scared people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they realized it's stupid to
criminalize alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 30s, when they dropped Prohibition,
they didn't say booze is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said the laws against booze are
causing more problems than the booze
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there today with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor LaGuardia in New York City back in
the 1930s said that if you've got a law on
[SPEAKER_00]: the books that you don't intend to enforce
consistently across the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: the very existence of that law erodes
respect for law enforcement in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It demoralizes your police force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we got a law in the books that
there's no serious intent to enforce
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they arrested everybody here tomorrow
in Seattle, this city would be one much
[SPEAKER_00]: less interesting place to call home,
wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm telling you, I'm a hardworking,
kid-raising, church-going, tax-paying
[SPEAKER_00]: American citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I work all day and I want to go
home and relax with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, that's my civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about hard on drugs or soft on
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just proposing that we learn a little
bit from Europe about pragmatic harm
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the crime out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognize marijuana, the responsible adult
recreational use of marijuana as a civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can be smart on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, nice to see you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great time and happy travels,
even if you're just staying home,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
