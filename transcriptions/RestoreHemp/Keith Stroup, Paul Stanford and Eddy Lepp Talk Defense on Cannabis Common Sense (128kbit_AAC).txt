[SPEAKER_01]: And Mr. Keith Straub, founder of Normal,
I want to welcome you back to the show
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: World's oldest marijuana smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were just talking earlier that just
last year during the Boston Freedom
[SPEAKER_01]: Festival, you had your first U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana arrest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, amazing, because I've been smoking
out front for... We founded Normal 37
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago, and I think I wasn't as out
front the first four or five years,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I went back recently because I'm
working on a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back and was surprised at how
honest about my own drug use I was in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1977.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, somewhere back there, I came out
front.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, they didn't bust me until
last year at the Boston Freedom Rally,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think it was strictly an accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was smoking a joint behind a
booth with the associate director at High
[SPEAKER_02]: Times, Rick Cusick, and we weren't trying
to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I would have lit up a joint on
the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just sharing a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, once they arrested us, they kept
trying to drop charges, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: we didn't want them to drop charges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three different times, they offered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, the judge said, if we'll just pay
the court costs, and our lawyer objected.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, no, we don't want to drop
charges.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, well, I'll waive the court costs,
and our lawyer objected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at any event, the judge finally
figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, ah, nullification.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we wanted... So, we ended up
going to trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both took the stand under oath and
said, of course, we were smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else would you be doing at the Boston
Freedom Rally?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a smoke in, for Christ's sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's why, obviously,
only a time, once a year, I go to Boston
[SPEAKER_02]: is to attend a smoke out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, at any event, they ended up
convicting us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people in the jury pool who were
favorable were too honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them even said to the judge,
judge, if they lit up a joint on the
[SPEAKER_02]: stand, I wouldn't convict them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all of the good people got taken out
of the jury pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the others didn't have much trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, to the judge's credit, he understood
it was an intellectual challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had no court costs, no fine,
no probation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prosecutor went six months probation
because they knew they'd put us on drug
[SPEAKER_02]: testing and we'd fail, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the judge said, no, no, no,
time served.
[SPEAKER_02]: We served 20 minutes when they arrested
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I thought it was... We didn't get
penalized for going to trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people in America do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you assert your rights and go to trial,
as Eddie knows, you pay a penalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I went through a federal
trial for growing marijuana back in,
[SPEAKER_01]: what was it, in 93, December of 93.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was told if I didn't take the plea
bargain offer, I was going to get 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they offered me five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't really seem like much of a
bargain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I did go to trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I admitted I did everything that the
judge and, you know, that the prosecutor
[SPEAKER_01]: was alleging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even call any witnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have one point where they
introduced my library that turned out to
[SPEAKER_01]: be pretty beneficial to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when my defense attorney was able
to cross examine the officer on the stand,
[SPEAKER_01]: he said, pick up this book, Marijuana,
Your Legal Rights, turn to page 219 and
[SPEAKER_01]: read the chapter headline.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cop picked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stuttered for about 30, 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judge said, read the chapter headline.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lawyer said, read the chapter headline.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just kept stuttering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, it came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said, juries can acquit defendants even
if they think they're guilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was about six pages long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about jury nullification.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prosecutor jumped up, objection,
objection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the judge says, oh, you can't object
to your own evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only object to their evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you introduced this evidence,
so you can't object to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kept in the record.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was acquitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I would have done 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really know of any other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a competent man to win on
nullification.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until about 1880 in this country,
defense lawyers could argue jury
[SPEAKER_02]: nullification.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could say to the jury, look,
if you think the defendant did his charge,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that it would not be fair to convict
him of a crime, which would be a marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most Americans know it shouldn't be a
crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't argue that because of a
Supreme Court decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was in 1880.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now what has to happen,
you have to figure out ways to try to let
[SPEAKER_02]: the jury know that if they're outraged by
this particular application of the law,
[SPEAKER_02]: they do not have to convict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them think they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't let them tell the jury,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got lucky in the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you didn't get so lucky, Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been sentenced yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I get sentenced December 21st.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in federal court?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to address what you said about having
the courage to stand by your convictions
[SPEAKER_00]: and take it clear to trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a half years ago, when they had
all four of the major components of the
[SPEAKER_00]: two warrants, I was looking at four life
sentences, $17 million in fines and an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional 40 years prior to the UDV
decision, which is a major religious
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offered me 30 months, 18 months in
prison and six months in a halfway house,
[SPEAKER_00]: six months at home, home detention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go back to the very real possibility on
December 1st being sentenced to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking for a 10-year minimum at
this time, which, of course, at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life is the equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a life sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a life sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: What useful life I have left as far as
being a productive member.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old are you now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 56 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've still got some life after you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're 66, don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, but the point I'm making is if
I take 10 years out of my life right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: what good am I going to be to myself or
anybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, I'll still be able to do,
you know, I'm not going to just die,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the other side of it is I might as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to keep fighting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the judge was emphatic after she
abolished me for smoking, growing or being
[SPEAKER_00]: around any marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: She then let me come up here and one of
the points she was emphatic about was that
[SPEAKER_00]: I let people know the dangers of growing
marijuana and the penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you quite frankly,
if you grow marijuana and the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government catches you, you cannot have
enough money, you cannot have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: power, you cannot have enough friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will destroy you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My attorneys won this case three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time all of the warrants were
thrown out, the judge said, do not put
[SPEAKER_00]: your lying witnesses to the prosecution on
my stand about open field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than a month later, she turned around
and allowed the open field warrant,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the case going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time, we did a flawless
presentation on the Religious Freedoms
[SPEAKER_00]: Restoration Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first five minutes, the judge came
out, agreed with every point we made,
[SPEAKER_00]: said that I was sincere, that this was
religious conviction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made every point that the Supreme Court
called for.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that we qualified for.
[SPEAKER_00]: She then spent the next five minutes
telling the prosecutor that he had failed
[SPEAKER_00]: on every count.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had not shown compelling interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had not shown least restrictive means.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the Udiva decision,
at that time, that case was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prosecutor submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: My attorney submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, as far as I know,
and I am not positive, maybe you know
[SPEAKER_00]: better, but as far as I know, at that
time, the judge was supposed to take
[SPEAKER_00]: everything under consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, this judge took it on herself to
become the prosecutor, explained that
[SPEAKER_00]: diversion was possible, even though the
Udiva decision said that diversion in and
[SPEAKER_00]: of itself is possible at any level and
therefore cannot be used as a sole
[SPEAKER_00]: compelling reason for a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used it for the sole compelling
decision, holding me over again in trial
[SPEAKER_00]: when I should have won the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we actually went to trial,
she tailored her jury instructions so
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically and defined the crime so
specifically that a gentleman that spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: to the jury after the fact told me that
one of the ladies that he spoke to told
[SPEAKER_00]: him with tears running down her face that
they knew I had broken no law,
[SPEAKER_00]: either state or federal, but that because
of the judge's specific jury instructions
[SPEAKER_00]: and the specific definitions that they
were given, they had no choice but to find
[SPEAKER_00]: me guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, in my jury pool, as you alluded
to, the guys that stood up and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, my mother died of marijuana or died
of cancer and used marijuana the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: years, it's the only thing that brought a
relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you something, Keith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any way to kind of exclude those
kind of questions from the jury?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say we're not going to ask them about
their marijuana use, and you can't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of defense lawyers,
in fact, don't quite, well, first off,
[SPEAKER_02]: in states, the judge usually does it,
not the defense lawyer, but in federal
[SPEAKER_02]: court, the defense lawyers get to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I hear, some of the more
experienced ones, will frequently waive
[SPEAKER_02]: their right to ask questions for the very
point you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sometimes think by the dress and the
way a juror acts that they can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: guess who's sympathetic, and if they ask
the damn question and the juror answers it
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly, they're thrown out of the pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of lawyers think they'd rather
rely on their own instincts than ask the
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw, I'm not sure how many people,
but at least six to eight people out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the jury pool when they came in with 80
people, nurses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Threw them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors threw them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that had any practical medical
knowledge got thrown out immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case, they were pre-screened before
they ever came to the courtroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
