[SPEAKER_00]: It is time we stop arresting marijuana
smokers and there's three basic reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is we're spending an estimated ten
billion dollars a year chasing and
[SPEAKER_00]: arresting and prosecuting otherwise
law-abiding citizens simply because when
[SPEAKER_00]: they relax in the evening they prefer to
smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's idiotic and it's a waste of law
enforcement resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, prohibition invites the
government into private areas of our life
[SPEAKER_00]: that are simply inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Americans agree we don't want the
government coming into our house to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what books we read, the subject of our
music we listen to, and certainly we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want them knowing and watching our
behavior in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well neither do they have any basis to get
involved in the decision as to whether we
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke marijuana or drink alcohol when we
relax in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is that when you ask the
public how they feel about marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: penalties you find that roughly eighty
percent now say they support the right of
[SPEAKER_00]: a seriously ill patient to use medical
marijuana when a doctor recommends it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighty percent, eight out of ten
Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then how come we've only won that in
thirteen states for Christ's sake?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we need to take that support
and convert it into public policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know now that seventy-six percent of
the public, three out of four Americans,
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with us on the basic premise that
you should not arrest and jail a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seventy-six percent, three out of four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have largely won the hearts and
minds of the American public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our challenge is to convert that into
public policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, more recently there was a poll
taken nationwide by Zogby, the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: commission, that showed fifty-two percent
of the public nationwide now favor not
[SPEAKER_00]: just decriminalizing marijuana but
legalizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalizing it, taxing it, regulating it
like we do alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one survey by the field poll company
in California found fifty-six percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in California now support
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what does this all mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it means honestly we're about to win
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting very close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think definitely in your lifetime,
I hope in mine, but within five years I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we're going to stop arresting
marijuana smokers in this country and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first few states are going to begin to
experiment with legally regulated markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice Anthony Kennedy, in writing for
the majority in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme Court recently, in a case said the
following, at the heart of liberty is the
[SPEAKER_00]: right to define one's own concept of
existence, of meaning, of the universe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of the mystery of the human life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the promise of the Constitution that
there is a realm of personal liberty where
[SPEAKER_00]: the government may not intervene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I said when I started,
there's absolutely nothing wrong with the
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible use of marijuana by adults and
it is of no interest to the government and
[SPEAKER_00]: they should stop arresting and start
respecting marijuana smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, we are only incidentally
talking about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really talking about personal
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join normal, stand up, legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on Keith.
