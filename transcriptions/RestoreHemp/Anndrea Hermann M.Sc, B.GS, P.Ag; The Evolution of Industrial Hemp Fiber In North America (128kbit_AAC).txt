[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, which is basically the only
place in North America where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: legally produce any hemp right now,
the main product is seed and the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the use of the fiber that's
produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the farmers growing separately for
fiber and separately for grain?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the initial beginning, we were growing
the taller stature cultivars that came
[SPEAKER_00]: over mostly from the Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that the industrial hemp has been
legalized in Canada since 1998,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've developed breeding programs to
actually breed for short stature
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, and that we wouldn't be dealing
with the fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The holdup right now is that we have a
lack of decortication equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the infrastructure that it's going
to take to actually decorticate the fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're getting the bast and the herd
separate for whether you're going into
[SPEAKER_00]: animal bedding, composite application,
or into a hemp creek or building press
[SPEAKER_00]: board types of applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're not able to haul the bales
completely across the provinces,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you need to have them really regionally
located closer to where the grower groups
[SPEAKER_00]: are, because if not, it becomes
uneconomical to be freighting bales on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of trucks to facilities that are
hundreds of miles away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there paper production going on in
Canada with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: None at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a little bit of fiber that is
coming into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: to be made into some artisan-type papers,
but not on the scale we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a huge business opportunity
to recognize the fact that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing demand for the hemp building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have all these other kinds of
interesting products and mandates from
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to actually go green and use
these type of green composites in their
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an opportunity for somebody to
recognize the fact that we do have this
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have farmers that are looking for
another venue of increasing the farm gate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's one of the major ways to do it,
is to take this fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
