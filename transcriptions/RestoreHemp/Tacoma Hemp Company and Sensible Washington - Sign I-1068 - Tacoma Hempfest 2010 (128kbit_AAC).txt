[SPEAKER_02]: We've got two of the gentlemen very,
very behind the I-1068 campaign for
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization of marijuana in Washington
State this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've seen any of these petitions
around or heard about this, it's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: because one of these two guys are one of
the many hundreds of volunteers across
[SPEAKER_02]: this state that are busting their asses to
get the signatures to do all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of you people that are out here
signing all these petitions for every
[SPEAKER_02]: other petition outside of 1068,
every one of these guys is a paid
[SPEAKER_02]: signature gatherer.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the 1068 signature gatherers are
unpaid volunteers, and we have got
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of thousands of signatures so far
without the financial incentive behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because this is what people
want in this state, in this country,
[SPEAKER_02]: for this life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get together and get 1068 signed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've signed anything else here today
and you have not signed 1068, please do so
[SPEAKER_02]: before you leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your friends to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell your parents, tell everybody,
sign this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you want it legal or you can't
stand it, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on the ballot and vote for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how this country works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now a couple words from these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been a little too busy gathering
signatures to actually prepare a speech,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I guess I'll have to ad hoc it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Chris Van Pudden, and I
coordinate the volunteer efforts
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout Pierce County on behalf of
I-1068 to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people ask me, how did you come to
do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you come to become a coordinator
on behalf of 1068?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I volunteered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started gathering signatures and I kept
gathering signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I kept gathering signatures and
no one started stepping up as a
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinator, I was selected and I said,
hey, I want to help other people gather
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, I guess it all started last
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started learning about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before, I'd just been brainwashed,
stigma, publicity, government,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read studies after study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more I read, the less prohibition
made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after I saw that 1068 was out,
signed the initiative, read it,
[SPEAKER_00]: realized I have to make the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to help other people make the
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we want to see a change in the world,
we have to make that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to let the people vote on the
change and let the government reflect the
[SPEAKER_00]: popular opinion of society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my opinion of how the world should be
doesn't coincide with how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's then my prerogative to coordinate
and to help reform society and help all of
[SPEAKER_00]: you to help 1068 and legalize marijuana.
Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Don Skaky with initiative 1068.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the Northwest Washington Field
Director and we are getting it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you've been told, none of us are
paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's been out on the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been out in bad weather,
cold weather, cloudy weather, sunny
[SPEAKER_01]: weather, hot weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, they're not getting it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are all getting it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because without you, we can't put it on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our polling says that when you talk to
voters, 53% say yes, 35% say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is way beyond the margin of error.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we need to do is get it on the ballot
and people will vote yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we don't get it on the ballot,
you're not going to have your chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to send it back to the
legislature where they can screw it all up
[SPEAKER_01]: like they tried to sell it in liquor
stores early this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't fly with my medicine next to
dangerous alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put this on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have not signed 1068, register to
vote if you're not already registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sign it if you have not already signed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, we are in the
process of counting right now and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a margin of error of seven and a half
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is because of people like you
that know that once you've signed it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of all volunteers that I'm
checking to make sure that you don't sign
[SPEAKER_01]: it more than one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lately we've had some problems with
other signature gatherers from paid
[SPEAKER_01]: petitions claiming to be us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, it can't hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're sure you've signed 1068,
please don't sign it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're not sure, if you don't
remember if it was that one or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you thought it was 1068 but when you
look at our sheet, take the time to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at what you're signing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's 1068 and get it signed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Taste of Tacoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Hoot Fest in Spokane.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Gay Pride up in Seattle this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have every other thing that's happening
in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you from someone that sat
there in that office the last couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days and counted signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at the numbers and they are
damn close people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are so close that we are either going
to or going to not make it on the ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: by the slimmest of margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to everyone you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask them to sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask them to volunteer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick up a petition out of the stranger
this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put one signature on it and mail it
in, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put five on it, God bless you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you fill 20 it up, you'll be one of
the ones that has changed history and
[SPEAKER_01]: ended prohibition in Washington State.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how often I've stood out
for hours and had person after person come
[SPEAKER_01]: up to me and say, you know, I can't sign
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My boss won't let me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My government won't let me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you're signing is to put it on the
ballot so the people can decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your vote will be secret in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let anyone tell you that you can't
sign this because you'll lose your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your First Amendment right to
address, I'm sorry, to petition your
[SPEAKER_01]: government for address of grievances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at the 14,000 people
that will be released from prison and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the hundred millions of dollars and Mark
Emery, God bless you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Emery is blocked out of Canada,
a sovereign country, a sovereign citizen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's taken to America and put in a
solitary confinement for trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize marijuana for adults in
Washington State.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't hurt you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, just in case any of you are unaware
of what you are holding in your hands,
[SPEAKER_02]: the picture of Mark Emery that you see
before you is a picture of a man that is
[SPEAKER_02]: held in a federal penitentiary not 30
miles from where we are standing today
[SPEAKER_02]: facing life imprisonment for selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a crime in his country.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a $200 fine for it, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this country, he's looking at life in
prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on the fact that this guy has
been doing everything he can for about the
[SPEAKER_02]: last 20 plus years to make your life
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've smoked pot in the last 20 years,
you've smoked something that Mark Emery
[SPEAKER_02]: was responsible for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You owe this man a lot more than any of
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're going to do for him
currently incarcerated 30 miles that
[SPEAKER_02]: direction is we're all going to say three
words very loud together a few times,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to send them a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to say, Free Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Free Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Free Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is for 20 people, but we are again
asking you to not smoke anything in the
[SPEAKER_02]: park.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing from 1068.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your duty and sign that petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your duty and vote your conscience on
November.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's eliminate the basis for a lot of
people in Washington's convictions where
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't get housing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get educational loans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All because they made a choice safer than
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it in Fremont and I'll say it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a working man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to support my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pay my taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make a choice that's safer than
alcohol, and I don't want to go to jail
[SPEAKER_01]: for having made that choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everybody for showing up for the
Tacoma Hemp Fest, staying calm,
[SPEAKER_02]: helping everybody out, following the
non-smoking rule in the park for tobacco,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just kind of helping out in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: If any of you see anybody that needs a
hand, please try and lend a hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see garbage that's overflowing and
you see anybody with one of these help
[SPEAKER_02]: shirts on out here, let them know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get it cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be able to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help to get the city to let
us do that next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to travel to Seattle to
go to one of these, help us keep it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us grow it bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you register to vote here,
you can sign the petition at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, everybody, we're about ready to
get the PA going back up, get some music
[SPEAKER_02]: going again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much for attending the
first annual Tacoma Hemp Fest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brought to you by Eat and Fly and Tacoma
Hemp Company.
