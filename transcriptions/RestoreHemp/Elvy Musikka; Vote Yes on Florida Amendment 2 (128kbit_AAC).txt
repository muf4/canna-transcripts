[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Elvie Musica and I'm sending a
very special message to the people of
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, especially South Florida,
because they stood behind me 26 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: when this loss had had me incarcerated
after I had already lost my better eye to
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your help and your support,
I won and shortly thereafter became the
[SPEAKER_00]: first woman to receive medical marijuana
from the federal government as my medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last 26 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I use it for arthritis, for insomnia,
for depression, for all of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: strike us as we get older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any, any pharmaceuticals in
my medicine cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My medicine is God-given cannabis,
hemp, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please vote yes on 2 and help the
thousands of people who desperately need
[SPEAKER_00]: you now as you helped me back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote on 2.
Thank you.
