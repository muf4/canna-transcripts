[SPEAKER_00]: We have another film clip we're going to
run right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interview I did with the driver
of the hemp car Greg Kyler He came through
[SPEAKER_00]: here about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hip car was running on a hundred
percent hemp seed oil There was no
[SPEAKER_00]: petroleum in the gas tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: No petroleum oil lubricating the engine It
was a hundred percent hemp driven car and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we need to go back to in the
future And we'll be talking a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about that in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy this film clip
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did you come to think of this the
hemp car idea and this this national tour
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing Well, I was I wanted to come
out to the west coast and some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental fashion and I've been
researching fields for a while and never
[SPEAKER_01]: really cared about hemp came across hemp
oil of transportation fuel and Put two and
[SPEAKER_01]: two together, you know, when was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you first back in October of last
year?
[SPEAKER_01]: October last year right around there and
Started asking, you know, how come this
[SPEAKER_01]: has been done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Took a look into the plant a little more
not a drug and still falls under the DEA
[SPEAKER_01]: band So put two and two together and
decided that I had to do it with hemp oil
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're getting hemp oil from Ohio
Yeah, it's originated from China and some
[SPEAKER_01]: from Canada and then it's some of it comes
into Ohio where it's made of biodiesel via
[SPEAKER_01]: Donmore Shafter at the Ohio And mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd square engine of Apple Energy who
processes the oil for us in the biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh What can you tell us about the car?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just normal car without completely
unmodified Mercedes diesel 1983 turbo
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel Any diesel engine can ride burn any
vegetable oil, but you'll get a longer
[SPEAKER_01]: engine life turning into biodiesel So
that's what we're doing What about your
[SPEAKER_02]: tour you started where watching in DC July
4th Big rally they have there every 4th of
[SPEAKER_01]: July at the rally and Took off from there
on July 4th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we covered to let's see today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's August 21st or 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah That's about seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been on the road and covered at
6,400 miles 6,400 miles and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: cities are you going to in total?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to about 50 cities in
how many days is that I'd send about a
[SPEAKER_02]: little over 90 days 50 cities in 90 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ambitious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's a hundred percent hemp
fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and what kind of mileage are you
getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: 27 miles to gallon just like the car came
from the factory floor And so it's being
[SPEAKER_01]: shipped to you along the yeah,
we have 12 like drop points We have our
[SPEAKER_01]: fuel ship ahead and we pick up as much as
we can carry Okay, that was Grant Kriger
[SPEAKER_00]: with the hemp car and that was run on a
hundred percent hemp seed oil now We're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking, you know, the price of oil has
gone through the roof lately Demand in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States continues to grow slowly But
the demand in India the demand in China is
[SPEAKER_00]: doubling every year So they're saying by
the end of the year That the price of oil
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be a hundred dollars a barrel
Well hemp seed oil can compete at those
[SPEAKER_00]: prices and hemp is actually three times
more productive than any other seed oil
[SPEAKER_00]: crop So the price of biodiesel will come
way down when we can grow moderately high
[SPEAKER_00]: THC plants hemp plants for biodiesel and
that's what our political committee is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start concentrating on a hemp for
biodiesel Initiative, so we'll be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: more about that in the weeks
