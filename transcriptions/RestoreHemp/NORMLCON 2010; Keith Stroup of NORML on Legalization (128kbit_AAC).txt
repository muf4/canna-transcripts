[SPEAKER_00]: I first smoked pot 45 years ago when I was
a freshman at Georgetown Law School in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been a regular smoker ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing wrong with the
responsible use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 40 years ago next month that normal
was formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, so we've been at this now
for four decades, and our position then
[SPEAKER_00]: and our position now is there's absolutely
nothing wrong with the responsible use of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana by adults, and it should be of
no interest or concern to the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no business knowing whether we
smoke or why we smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Alan mentioned in his opening comments,
we really are at a tipping point in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more living Americans who have
smoked marijuana than living Americans who
[SPEAKER_00]: have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the increasing support we have
from the public now, we've made more
[SPEAKER_00]: political progress in the last five years
than in the first 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks, we are very close to winning
this, closer than it looks like when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're out struggling on the street level,
I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once change begins, it happens more
quickly than you anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you.
