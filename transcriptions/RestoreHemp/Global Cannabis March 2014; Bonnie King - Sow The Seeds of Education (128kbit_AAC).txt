[SPEAKER_00]: And certain people have made these things
possible in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many cannabis warriors that
have come before us that don't get nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: enough attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of us get to come out here and
march around and we have our cheers and
[SPEAKER_00]: our chants and our flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But years ago, there were only a few
people that had the guts to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to give them homage on a day
like today, rain or shine, they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Phil Levesque is one guy, he's still
alive and well and 91 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is one of the premier people,
not just in the state of Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but throughout the United States that has
helped make today happen, that has brought
[SPEAKER_00]: this in front of the people, that has been
an honest, true, brave warrior to the
[SPEAKER_00]: extent that he lost his entire career and
is no longer able to sign prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave up his right to be a doctor
basically for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hare is another guy that a lot of you
people would have seen here today if he
[SPEAKER_00]: was still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack was this terrific warrior that never,
never gave up under any circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would he say today?
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd say, sow the seeds of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that's here, we are not
preaching to the choir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys need to take everything home and
tell 100 people, that's what Jack would
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta keep the momentum up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition is an ugly, ugly thing and we
need to yank it out of the ground like a
[SPEAKER_00]: root and make this a better thing for all
people in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get those 800,000 people,
stop them from getting arrested and jailed
[SPEAKER_00]: every year, think of the happy times
everybody would have at Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the people that would have
a fulfilled life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's about medical, but it's also
just about life, liberty and happiness and
[SPEAKER_00]: ending prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in closing, I'd like to say one,

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
