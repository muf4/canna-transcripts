[SPEAKER_00]: Gatewood Galbraith, come on up here my
brother man, all the way from Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell you some truth, this guy's been
doing this longer than Hempfest has been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him some warm love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I hope you all remember that the
theme of this Hempfest is this one's for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is for Jack Hare.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of you young folks out there,
if it wasn't for Jack Hare, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be here at this Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there wouldn't be a Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hare is responsible for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a couple minutes to pay
tribute to my friend Jack Hare who passed
[SPEAKER_00]: this past several months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my tribute to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hare is a social and philosophical
tsunami.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ripples from whose splash will forever
grace the shores of human consciousness in
[SPEAKER_00]: every freedom-loving nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a grand champion of We the People
and the natural cycle in our battle with
[SPEAKER_00]: the synthetic subversion which threatens
the very concept of the sovereignty of
[SPEAKER_00]: each human individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's tireless efforts to eliminate the
facts about cannabis had furnished freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: fighters everywhere with the tools of
knowledge with which to resist the fascism
[SPEAKER_00]: of the corporate state as it seeks to
subject everyone to its economic bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack recognized that cannabis is a gateway
to existentialism which enlightens our
[SPEAKER_00]: existence and is the basis of our freedom
of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also recognized the miraculous healing
powers of this herb and many sick and
[SPEAKER_00]: dying people have found comfort in its use
after reading his wonderful manifesto,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hare's grand spirit may have left his
worn out body but he has entered into the
[SPEAKER_00]: hearts and minds of millions of us who
will forever be grateful to have been
[SPEAKER_00]: educated by his commitment to the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you Jack Hare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message that Jack and I have is that
your younger generation are open to perils
[SPEAKER_00]: to which he and I never had to conceive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there is a great move afoot to take
you out of the property of sovereign human
[SPEAKER_00]: beings and put you into the property of
the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
military, industrial, transnational,
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate fascist elite son of a bitches
who see the constitution and the bill of
[SPEAKER_00]: rights as impediments to the
implementation of their new world order in
[SPEAKER_00]: global economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are not warm and fuzzy about you
or me or our children or grandchildren and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are afraid to give everybody in the
rest of the world due process and
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutional rights so in order to make
it one world they are going to take ours
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question of hemp, the question of
cannabis is the most vivid illustration of
[SPEAKER_00]: how this government has overstepped its
bounds in policing the private behavior of
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they told us we couldn't plant a hemp
seed in the ground they severed us from
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what they seek to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the synthetic subversion for
they want to replace all the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: products on earth that used to be grown
out of gods and earth and gods seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: replace them with synthetic products and
knock our farmer out of the agrarian
[SPEAKER_00]: society and the agrarian market and make
the ghost towns of our small cities and
[SPEAKER_00]: villages across this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to rediscover a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that will allow our farmers to go back
to the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that will allow our farmers to compete
with the petro chemical pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7% agricultural land in hemp you would
have to import another drop of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can replace the spills in the Gulf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can replace the environmental
catastrophe that the petroleum pipelines
[SPEAKER_00]: have gassed upon mother earth and instead
let our farmers grow hemp as a fuel crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1991 Willie Nelson and I poured hemp
oil into my Mercedes diesel and drove it
[SPEAKER_00]: across Kentucky in my bed for governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he started his biofuel plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen folks you all have been handed a
torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herod bless his soul passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting old up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we cannot make carry this ball
much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to become educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to reach out there and grab the
responsibility of maintaining your
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every generation must continue in its own
freedom and those very sacrifices right up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the very last second I've been talking
to you made on your behalf cannot continue
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really counts is your own commitment
to what sacrifices you're willing to make
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future to maintain your freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is right there in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to learn the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to learn the political
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to reach out there and
take responsibility for your own freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live your life like a warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me out here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you all.
