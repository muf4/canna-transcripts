[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk to everybody today about
a couple things the big things I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to people today about our prison
incarceration Compassion and making this a
[SPEAKER_00]: better place for us not only here in
Oregon where it's really really really
[SPEAKER_00]: really wonderful And I hope you all
realize that right now I've got enough
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in my pocket to send me to
prison for the rest of my life in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: places in the United States Okay,
so I want you to understand that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: living in a place right now where
marijuana is very very legal there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people in this country who don't have
that they don't have that ability and so
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want to talk about today and one of
the people I really want to talk about is
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernard Noble does anybody here know who
Bernard Noble is raise your hand if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Bernard Noble is I got you Russ I got
my team over here I got Raphael over here
[SPEAKER_00]: I got anybody else anybody else here who's
done five plus years in prison anybody you
[SPEAKER_00]: back there come up for a minute I want you
to come up it's important and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to I'm not gonna talk I'm not gonna
say anything about you specifically but I
[SPEAKER_00]: want people to understand something here
we've got this man here who's done over
[SPEAKER_00]: five years in prison understand that
Bernard Noble Louisiana 13-year minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: mandatory sentence can anybody tell me how
much marijuana Mr. Noble had on him when
[SPEAKER_00]: he was sentenced to 13 years in prison
from a mandatory minimum Miss Johnson come
[SPEAKER_00]: up here that much marijuana this sent a
man to prison for 13 goddamn years okay a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of lawyers worked really hard a lot of
people worked really hard a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: advocates worked really hard can anyone
tell me how much time Mr. Noble actually
[SPEAKER_00]: served seven years seven goddamn years in
prison for an amount of marijuana can you
[SPEAKER_00]: hold that up for me Miss Johnson that
amount of marijuana sent a man to prison
[SPEAKER_00]: for seven years in this country right now
okay that's what we're living with in
[SPEAKER_00]: America this this bottle right here this
is 30 years to life in Mississippi this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what stops people's seizures this is what
stopped people from being in chronic pain
[SPEAKER_00]: all day this is what stops people from
hurting every day of their life and for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of us out there it just makes us feel
good after work so we don't have to drink
[SPEAKER_00]: three shots of whiskey okay so I want to
be really clear we live in an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: place in Oregon any one of you who's 21
years of age or older or 18 and older and
[SPEAKER_00]: a medical patient can walk into a store
and buy this this was given to me today by
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who has the right to make it
because Oregon has homegrown we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: right to grow your own medicine or
recreation as you see fit and we fought
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard for that privilege not every
state has that every state will have that
[SPEAKER_00]: that will happen that day will come back
because that day was not that long ago we
[SPEAKER_00]: will end marijuana prohibition entirely in
this country one day at a time one person
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time one prisoner at a time I want
you to understand though I want you
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone in here to think for a moment
this gentleman spent five plus years in
[SPEAKER_00]: prison okay what I want right now from
everyone here is something really simple
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's silence I want everyone here to
take 30 seconds and I want you to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about what it would be like to spend the
next five years of your life in prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of marijuana that I'm holding
in my hand okay I'm gonna time it I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna shut up it's really rare that I shut
up so starting now 30 seconds of silence
[SPEAKER_00]: you just did 30 seconds the man who just
walked off the stage did five years
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernard Noble did seven years four months
and a couple days and he's still he's on
[SPEAKER_00]: parole he's still getting drug tested
every month he's still in the position
[SPEAKER_00]: that if he screws up in the slightest if
he so much as runs a red light that man's
[SPEAKER_00]: back in prison over two grams of marijuana
so I want everyone here today to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about what it would be like to spend that
amount of time in a metal cage over a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because that's what we're still
dealing with in America every single one
[SPEAKER_00]: of you here today has the right to rock
around as long as you're an adult with an
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce of marijuana in your pocket and no
one gets to say much else to you and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a wonderful privilege that we live
in such a place but it's not finished just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's done here doesn't mean it's
done everywhere else I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: notice or not but my accent ain't from
here I'm originally from North Carolina my
[SPEAKER_00]: family members died in prison okay I had
friends and family who in cages they went
[SPEAKER_00]: there for years and years and years for an
amount of marijuana that honestly people
[SPEAKER_00]: in stores here throw on a counter and can
sell to you I want you to understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have it really really good we have it
amazing in Oregon we have a system here
[SPEAKER_00]: that rivals any in the US are we gonna
make it better yes there are problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: it everyone here knows if you're involved
in this fight that it's not perfect but
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want you to understand is that when
people come here from Mississippi when
[SPEAKER_00]: they come here from Louisiana when they
come here from Idaho when they come here
[SPEAKER_00]: from the south when they come here from
other countries where marijuana is the
[SPEAKER_00]: death penalty they come to a place that
allows them freedom that allows the
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion and allows us to live in a
better world because we get to share with
[SPEAKER_00]: those people thank you very much I
appreciate all of you okay I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: one last thing and I do it every year I
have to do it and it is this this is my
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter I don't know if you've ever seen
it it's my business card it's what I give
[SPEAKER_00]: out to people it's my way of making the
world a better place because it's free
[SPEAKER_00]: legal advice it'll keep you out of 99% of
your problems what we're gonna do is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna walk through it it says one simple
thing am I free to go officer if I am
[SPEAKER_00]: being detained I do not consent to any
searches and I want to speak with my
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney prior to answering any questions
once again am I free to go officer if I am
[SPEAKER_00]: being detained I do not consent to any
searches and I want to speak with my
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney prior to answering any questions
I can't fix every single one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: problems but what I can do with this is
keep the cops out of your life out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: car out of your home out of your lives out
of your children's lives and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: world a better fucking place you
