[SPEAKER_00]: In 2003, I think I met Dr. Phil Levesque.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you guys know Dr.
Levesque.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, this is Dr. Levesque.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the closest I could get today
because he just couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is almost life for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really a tall guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, if he was here, he'd have all
kinds of advice to give to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doc Levesque was one of the main guys that
helped the law, the initiative in 1998
[SPEAKER_00]: become a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had problems with the Oregon Medical
Board because he signed more patients
[SPEAKER_00]: authorizations than any other doctor in
the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped 5,000 patients before they took
him out in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had five good years that he helped
all these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thousand of them are veterans and we
hear from them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear from them at SalemNews.com because
he's a regular writer for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's a really special guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He turned 90 years old just a couple of
months ago and he's still going strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see him around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He writes for us two, three, four times a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So catch his stuff on SalemNews.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: He covers PTSD and a lot of toxicology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a forensic toxicologist and a
pharmacologist, one of the only ones in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so though he can't sign applications
anymore, he can still talk about what he
[SPEAKER_00]: knows to be true fact, which is that
cannabis cures and he knows it to be true
[SPEAKER_00]: just as we all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to share that with you
that Doc does wish that he could be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on his behalf, I'd like to say what he
would of course leave you with,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't smoke in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you guys are family and we always
think of the cannabis community as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to look at each other and
realize, you know, this isn't a fad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, we don't want to look
at each other as people that we only run
[SPEAKER_00]: into at places like this because it's a
cool place to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an activist, if you believe in
Indian prohibition, then you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at each other as your brothers and
sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take care of each other,
keep each other out of harm's way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody that you know get
arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, turn them on to the best
information that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a lot of resources at Salem
news dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please feel free to use us in that way
as much as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of people that have
really sacrificed a lot that are serving
[SPEAKER_00]: time in prison today that have been for
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we've got Reverend Roger
Christie in Hawaii three years in federal
[SPEAKER_00]: detention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff needs to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Doc Labeck also, he is a sacrificial
lamb.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sacrificed his whole career for us,
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do him the favor that he is doing
for us and give it your all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign your petitions and make sure you vote
and speak up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that it really makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thank you very much.
Thank you.
