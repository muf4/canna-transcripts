[SPEAKER_01]: Feeling the feeling of something gone
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you define what you can't explain?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the dragging on, hunger gnaws on long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in self-defense, long keeps gnawing
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the thoughts don't know what to
think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where I've been doesn't remember a
thing about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something strange going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that had unraveled and now is
rambling back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to all, I thought I'd escaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those places I don't want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't want could care less about any
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not with its own need for a fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at what's been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I did was go along for the ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't ask where we were going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any shadowing of light flung to the edge

[SPEAKER_01]: And reality didn't even blink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those dreams marked by scars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rampaging question is who would want
to scar a dream?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's scars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scars need dreams too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Riding a shattering of breaking into an
echo of silence.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bitter taste looks for someone sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeling the feeling of something gone
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you define what you can't explain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Riding a shadowing of light flung to the
edge collided with reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reality didn't even blink.
