[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you call ribbon hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took stems after the trimmers were done
and under the carve-out exemption from
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana that mature stocks and the fiber
they're from are not marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took these mature stocks, we soaked
them in water overnight, and then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: day we peeled the bark off of the hemp
stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is ribbon hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's starting with ribbon hemp and
these are some woollen carters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this what a sheep herder or a sheep
processor would use?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, this is all plant fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we work the fiber and this combs
the cuticle off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making a bit of a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you come down with in the
end, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this breaks it apart and takes the
cuticle off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is almost as soft as a wool or
sheep sweater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a little finer than a wool
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 18 micron diameter is the real
fibers from the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the real fibers from the hemp.
This is the real fibers from the hemp.
