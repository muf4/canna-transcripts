[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, they could do this in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we could do it in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we could get it going in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could take this thing all around the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that majority and keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stop being the silenced majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a few people out there
in the land speaking against all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a few of them, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're the ones with the airwaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the silenced majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not a minority.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get out there and support it
and make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we can do it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to everybody you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to your local police officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to your minister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to your husband, your wife,
your kids, your mom, your dad,
[SPEAKER_01]: your grandma, your grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, because once the truth is
out, who's going to keep this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to stop, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when's it going to stop?
[SPEAKER_01]: When does it end?
[SPEAKER_01]: So meanwhile, what are we here for?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to have a good time.

[SPEAKER_02]: We can rub this thing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been rocking in the groove.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just roll it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to get yourself up on this hill,
one wave length.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let your heart do the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're speaking for this feeling.
