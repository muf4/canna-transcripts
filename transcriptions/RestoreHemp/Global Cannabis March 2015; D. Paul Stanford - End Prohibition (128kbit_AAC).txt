[SPEAKER_00]: We've got legal marijuana Congratulations,
and thank you for making it happen Staying
[SPEAKER_00]: at the fight for so long You know I've
been saying a long time that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition has never really been about
drugs It's about control and money and
[SPEAKER_00]: power and the continued centralization of
economic and political control I truly
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that marijuana the whole marijuana
myth was created To stop the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: biofuels and fiber they made up that whole
myth and so Finally, the truth is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: to light, but we're still experiencing
blowback We still have the legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to shut down the medical marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been successful across the river
in Washington with Senate bill 505 to
[SPEAKER_00]: which Governor Inslee signed into law just
last week They have to stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they can Organize a referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need 120,000 signatures in the next
75 days or so Good luck to the folks
[SPEAKER_00]: behind that Hopefully we won't have to do
a referendum here in Oregon We have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: friends of the legislature But we have to
stay active with them as well and contact
[SPEAKER_00]: them and let them know what we don't like
it looks like The community's done a great
[SPEAKER_00]: job last week in reaching out and stopping
some of the worst aspects of the dash 6
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments to Senate bill 844 But it's
still working its way through there and we
[SPEAKER_00]: got to keep an eye on it Anyway,
