[SPEAKER_00]: Let's unite today under one banner,
normal, normal Women's Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: Organ Green, Free THC, all of the
organizations, Green Leaf Love,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, the Wellness Center,
cannabis, we're all out here doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same damn thing, trying to end
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Anna said, I'm tired, tired,
tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen my people go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deal with women every day and men that
cry because their children are taken away
[SPEAKER_00]: from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you think medical marijuana is
enough, but it's not enough to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your parental custody rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take your baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like Reinhardt, is that what her
name is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay Reinhardt, she came over here and
spoke here for freedom and they took her
[SPEAKER_00]: baby from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you think medical marijuana is
enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not enough when our people are being
incarcerated, when our economy is
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering while other countries' economies
prosper from industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what the biggest complaint as
we moved forward with our House Bill 3371
[SPEAKER_00]: was?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get complaints from the state
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got complaints from the local sheriff
saying, where's our cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is time for us to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You contact your representatives and you
let them know that it is time to move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with House Bill 3371.
[SPEAKER_00]: To allow us to build colleges and not more
prisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send our kids to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop sending our kids and our future
to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm the grandmother of six
children, three boys, three girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm proud as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I fear every day that they are being
disproportionately not only incarcerated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but racial profiling is a huge problem
across the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our prisons are filled with blacks and
whites and poor whites and brown people
[SPEAKER_00]: like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just because we brought
marijuana to this country, God dang guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to do something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all love it when you're getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put us in jail now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us out folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank Russ and Iko,
this guy who took over Oregon Normal and
[SPEAKER_00]: it lives on baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott, Paul Loney, Lee Berger,
all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to the Cannabis Cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, girl!
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go!
Let's go!
