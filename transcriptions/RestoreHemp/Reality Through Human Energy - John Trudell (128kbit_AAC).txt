[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if whatever's going on in this
dimensional reality will never out-fight
[SPEAKER_00]: them, it's about out-thinking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about out-thinking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about that.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: About out-thinking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternative energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternative energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conscious, live thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Process of thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the alternative energy that can
make the change to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really have to understand what this
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really have to get it and understand
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we become that power.
[SPEAKER_01]: The power of the people doesn't have shit
to do with the vote or any other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to do with thinking with a clear,
coherent, intelligent mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly and coherent.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much power do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you make yourself feel miserable with
your fears and your doubts and your
[SPEAKER_01]: insecurities?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do that, you have the power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply put.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter, but that's power
used incoherently and chaotically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some mental shifts here and use that power
clearly and coherently and real change.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the power of the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this cannabis tax act.
[SPEAKER_01]: The voting is like using it as a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just use it as a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your power isn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your power is here.
