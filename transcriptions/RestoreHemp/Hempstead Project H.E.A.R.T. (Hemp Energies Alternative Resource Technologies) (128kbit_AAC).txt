[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting involved in this idea of
what we call Hempstead Project Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempsteadprojectheart.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to put in that little address
thing up there on the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempsteadprojectheart.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really about we want,
we think it's time to start focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: energy on hemp specifically as an
alternative energy and economy and
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's healthy for the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at trying to encourage
people that agree with that to take any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of act on it, however they know how
to act, but to not be silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do anything, do anything that you can
because it all adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well on the Hempstead thing, one of the
things we've done on the site is we've put
[SPEAKER_00]: links so that people can go and find out
about hemp because I think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really understand what hemp can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean as a resource from food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people really understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people would go look and at least
check it out, check out the facts about
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's really all about and then if
they're in agreement on that act on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always ask everybody this one question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could say anything to the marijuana
community, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out there and put these efforts into
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same energy and effort that was put
into medical marijuana by the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: people, THC people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that same energy should be put
into hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by putting that energy into hemp,
it's more consistent because when we go
[SPEAKER_00]: for the medical marijuana, that's just for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go for the hemp, we're now
repaying the earth because it's for the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth as well as for us because it's
healthy for the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used medical marijuana and wanted it
because it's healthy for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the same thing applies, hemp is
healthy for the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to see the medical
marijuana put some of the same intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: and energy into now getting medicine for
the earth that was used to get it for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see hemp around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it could be solving a lot of
the world's problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that this or that
have opinions about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're suggesting is go check out the
facts about what can really be done with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean from food to clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out the facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what can really be done with it
because we've got to take it from being
[SPEAKER_00]: just an abstraction hemp as an add on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about global warming,
climate change, all of these things we're
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing and talking about, hemp has a
tremendous impact on being able to help to
[SPEAKER_00]: balance what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're asking people to research,
check it out, and if they're in agreement,
[SPEAKER_00]: to act on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not in agreement, well then
they're not in agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
