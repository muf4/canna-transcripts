[SPEAKER_00]: There are times I turned out crooked And
times I turned on doubts There are times I
[SPEAKER_00]: just kept trying And times I just went
without From the heart there are times I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like screaming And times I probably
did There are times I can't quite remember
[SPEAKER_00]: And times I can never forget
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times love is a shadow And times
love is a chain There are times love is
[SPEAKER_00]: the light And times love is to blame
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times a smile is a smile And
times when it is not There are times time
[SPEAKER_00]: buys And times time bought There are times
I went way out there And times I never
[SPEAKER_00]: came back There are times I have a great
feeling And times when I don't feel a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing There are times love is a shadow And
times love is a chain There are times love
[SPEAKER_00]: is the light And times love is to blame
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times I keep waiting for And
times that are never going to come There
[SPEAKER_00]: are times I could have done different And
times different isn't there From the heart
[SPEAKER_00]: there are times The balance is balance And
times the rush is too extreme There are
[SPEAKER_00]: times when it's all I can do to live And
times I'm glad that I do
There are times I can't remember And times
I can't forget There are times love is a
shadow And times I never came back There
are times time buys And times love is to
blame There are times I could have done
different And times love is to blame There
are times
