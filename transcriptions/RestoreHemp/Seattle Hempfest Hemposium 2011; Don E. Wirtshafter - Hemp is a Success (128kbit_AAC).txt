[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, this is pretty historical,
you know, Dave, Denny, and Aguadas here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I should introduce Aguadas,
but the four of us have been at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get our 20-year pins in the hemp
industry, you know, and we're approaching
[SPEAKER_00]: our 25-year pins in the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stay current on cannabis issues,
and I'm helping cannabis providers in a
[SPEAKER_00]: general sense in the modern era and the
edges that those cannabis providers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'll say I'm doing, I'm helping the
people that are playing with the synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids here in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, the HempFest is a real
indicator of where we are and how
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible HempFest has become.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organization here, the people,
the core... You just gave 35 bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can anybody match that 35 bucks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody, come on, somebody match this 35
bucks right there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: HempFest has been, it's a success because
hemp is a success, and whether you know it
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, just like the East Coast can't see
that cannabis is no big deal out West,
[SPEAKER_00]: the America can't see that hemp is no big
deal anywhere else in the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, and it's actually becoming a big
deal because it's becoming big industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's more than 10,000 people
directly employed producing hemp products,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plans, the momentum there is...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's humongous, and it's not just hemp
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started off with hemp foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first thing that made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's building materials,
and that's gonna make the thing go huge
[SPEAKER_00]: because the quantities of hemp that are
needed to make building materials are farm
[SPEAKER_00]: size, county size, growing of industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna become a commodity that will be
traded in car loads and on the futures
[SPEAKER_00]: market in our left times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than in back alleys and otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a great positive shift.
