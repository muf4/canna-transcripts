[SPEAKER_00]: This comes in a matter, I think,
of finding new ways to approach this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people that created the
Inquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us to be surprised by anything that
they would do, then we're not being
[SPEAKER_00]: realistic and pragmatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some act of cruelty or stupidity or
just plain old cold-bloodedness happens
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're shocked and surprised by it,
then shame on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shame on us because we've been doing it
for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, to me, a matter,
because everything's about energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're focusing their energy,
we can call it, whether it's the hate
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, all the distortion, but they're
focusing their energy in such a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being effective for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also because they can hit us and
push emotional buttons and pull distorts
[SPEAKER_00]: out of us, then they distort our energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, I think what's really ahead
of us is it's not even a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: out-organizing them, it's a matter of
out-thinking them, thinking differently,
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of their definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, we're talking about alternative
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the whole marijuana thing,
all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, everything is about energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I look at it as, well,
we are individual alternative energy
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we looked at ourselves as alternative
energy, as well as we do hemp or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: else, and understood the value of that,
and then used that power of our creative
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence, used that power of our
creative intelligence, clearly and
[SPEAKER_00]: coherently, we can out-think these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not happening because we've been
imprinted and wired to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: insecurities, these doubts, and these
reactionary fears, so they know they can
[SPEAKER_00]: push an emotional button.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're spending, however many of these
things are, half of that just put out
[SPEAKER_00]: there just to push our emotional buttons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to recruit a new...
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been rebelling against the
oppressor class since there's been an
[SPEAKER_00]: oppressor class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look within my own lifetime,
we were young, idealistic, all our stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted all to be good and fairness and
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out there, we took all that out
there, basically that the generations had
[SPEAKER_00]: done before, in the way that they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: If our intentions are good, our motives
are good, our idealism is good,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yet they stay on top of us,
then what's missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what's missing is we weren't
using the power of our creative
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly and coherently.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, we were just picking up all behavior
patterns and organizing the same way,
[SPEAKER_00]: under the same definitions that the
generation before had, and the generation
[SPEAKER_00]: before had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never approach it from the perspective
of, well maybe life is about
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility and not freedom,
because responsibility has got a definite
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning to us, whereas freedom is an
abstraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, because I can say I believe in
freedom, but then that means that the
[SPEAKER_00]: racist life that lies about him and all
these things, then they have the freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, so it's an abstraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've never really approached this
whole thing from the perception of
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we want to be free,
being free is connected to responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being oppressed is connected to this
abstract, illogical, no definition of
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
So that's what we're trying to do.
