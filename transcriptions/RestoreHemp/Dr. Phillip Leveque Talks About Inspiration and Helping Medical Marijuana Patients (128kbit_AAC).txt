[SPEAKER_00]: When I was about 12 years old,
I decided that I wanted to be a forensic
[SPEAKER_00]: chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: A forensic chemist has turned out to be a
toxicologist, but it wasn't called that at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My training professor was the Oregon State
Chemist for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he trained me as a toxicologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I got to medical school,
I became a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: of pharmacology and toxicology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you taught pharmacology and toxicology
in a number of medical schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught physiology, pharmacology and
toxicology for about 10 medical schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was invited to East Africa, Uganda and
Tanzania, where I trained the first
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors in Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were at the University of Georgia,
Ohio?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recruited by the University of
London to teach in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, just like I say, I trained the
first doctors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a medical school professor for 25
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last three years, I was a full-time
student while I was a full-time professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was at the Doc College?
[SPEAKER_00]: Osteopathic College in Des Moines,
Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the strange thing about it was that I
got my osteopathic degree when I was 54
[SPEAKER_00]: years old, and I was older than most of
the teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you started being an
individual practicing osteopath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had got associated with Paul at a town
hall meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were at KATU, Channel 2's town
hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in the hot seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just before the vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the week, just two days before the
vote in 1998, where we were urging people
[SPEAKER_01]: to vote yes on Measure 67 for medical
marijuana and no on Referendum Measure 57
[SPEAKER_01]: to recriminalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legislature in 97 had passed a bill to
recriminalize marijuana, and we got 90,000
[SPEAKER_01]: signatures to stop that from going into
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year later, we got another 120,000 to
put the marijuana legalization on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went into this town hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there was this one side of the
studio where people largely in favor of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, and the other side of the
studio where people largely against
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were right in the middle of the
crowd that was against marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the whole thing was there were so
many people pro-marijuana, and I was on
[SPEAKER_00]: crutches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to sit on the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was the name of that attorney who
was running that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jack Schweig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, now that's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember his last name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jack, he was the emcee for a number of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he wanted to know if anybody on the
other side wanted to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I raised my hand and I said,
I think everybody around you thought you
[SPEAKER_01]: were about to launch into something about
how terrible marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I says, marijuana has been used for
five thousand years as medicine and has
[SPEAKER_00]: never killed anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people start to scoot away from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I I noted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as that show was over,
I came and invite you to co-host this
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started this show in nineteen ninety
six in late nineteen ninety six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you came on it about show number
seventy five or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some clips of some of these
earlier shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We play here a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had Paul Loney on as a guest
host.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he stayed on to about show one hundred
and twenty five or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we switched over from this
private studio that Lanny Swerdlow had
[SPEAKER_01]: started the first done the first hundred
twenty shows, you moved over to when we
[SPEAKER_01]: started to record shows here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you stayed at it for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first the first applications
that I wrote were in your homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For about three different homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened is that people start
coming to the TV show before the show to
[SPEAKER_01]: get you to sign their papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just started to be overwhelming in
terms of the people coming just before the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I so I just move it over to my home
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that became I had my kids were young
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're young adults now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they I roll around on the floor and
pick up all the food scraps and toys and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually we opened an office on
Broadway in forty fifth and we outgrew
[SPEAKER_01]: that office the day we opened it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we kept going.
