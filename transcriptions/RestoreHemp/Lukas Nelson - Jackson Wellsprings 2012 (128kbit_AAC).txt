[SPEAKER_00]: I'm walking down the road and I am coming
to a funny place inside my head Thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the time you left me alone to be
thinking And where I'm going I'm never
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing if businesses are learning or I'm
gone They understand the world about
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing Let's follow it
[SPEAKER_00]: Suicides are coming now cause everyone
believes in escaping Shackled in my chains
[SPEAKER_00]: I move slowly but I want it to be free I
read it in the starry light that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing free into the night I feel it to
be blown by a bullet Let's follow it
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm sitting crazy here counting
back the years and the cheers I'm wishing
[SPEAKER_00]: I could celebrate but I don't have the
energy to cheer
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting with my beer in hand and
hoping that I'll one day understand Now I
[SPEAKER_00]: hold my breath I'm turning towards a ghost
that's following me La la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la
