[SPEAKER_00]: How many folks here want to have a job?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many folks here want to have a place
to live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our state legislators, they don't care if
you have a job if you're a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care if you have a place to
live if you're a marijuana consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as they're concerned, you can be
hungry and homeless living on the streets
[SPEAKER_00]: if you use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we march, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Portland, as was mentioned
earlier, they asked us, why are you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: still marching?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we fixed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have consumers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have businesses out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses can now sell, but where can you
use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a renter, you cannot use it in
your home if your landlord doesn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most employers, they'll fire you if you
turn up positive in a urine test for THC
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care whether it was smoked a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to fire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're here, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we march.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we march for our brothers and sisters
who can't march publicly in cities around
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, even, where they have to hide
their belief in the marijuana plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that marijuana plant is the best plant for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're marching for folks that
can't march, because they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: blackballed by the local jurisdiction that
they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we march because we need to have our
rights to gather in public and use
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana when we want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's again, our state
legislature says, you guys can't smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana if you're a renter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not legal, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure 91, which I helped draft,
it was a partial step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't let anybody ever tell you that
we have legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the best model in the country,
but it's only partway built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to make sure that we have a
place to live, a place where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: social clubs, and that the fact that the
city of Portland, you know, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: charge, they're charging outrageous sums
of money if you want to get into marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, it falls right into the
state legislature and the bureaucrats,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would only like to regulate a few
large industries dealing with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to tell them, no, that this is
truly a cottage industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a right to grow and sell
marijuana with minimal fees, not expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just remember that when you're out
there, when you're talking to your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, why did you spend a beautiful
Saturday in the streets of Portland when
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have been home gardening or
doing something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're losing our rights,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they say, oh, you guys,
you have legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go into a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and here's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a patient, you can buy it tax
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, what good does that do if
the patient is low income?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when before they were getting it
for free, you know, and taxes only were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be 20%, who's paying for the
other 80%, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't make any sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Anna was talking about,
not just write and call your letters,
[SPEAKER_00]: just go visit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they have a town hall, and they all
love to have these little town halls,
[SPEAKER_00]: go talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to see real people, because
right now, you know, down in Salem,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're seeing the big business,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't let marijuana become big
business here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to show the entire world that we
grow the best marijuana in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have the most freedoms with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Anna is still out there,
I'm sure she'd want me to help lead folks
[SPEAKER_00]: in this little thing we have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back here on my poster, you know,
these four things, when you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: officer comes up to you, you still need to
remember these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though marijuana is somewhat legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go repeat after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the one right there on his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish to remain silent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
