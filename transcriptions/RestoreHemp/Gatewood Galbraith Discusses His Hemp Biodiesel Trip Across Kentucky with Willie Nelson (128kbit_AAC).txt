[SPEAKER_01]: Could you tell our audience a little bit
how that came about and how you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: first taught Willie Nelson, who's now a
big proponent of biodiesel, about hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd always heard that Rudolf Diesel had
manufactured his diesel engine run off
[SPEAKER_00]: seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really didn't understand, quite grasp,
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in the early 90s, late 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a fellow from Nevada,
Las Vegas, Nevada, came through town
[SPEAKER_00]: driving a little Volkswagen diesel and he
was running it off Burger King oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had just derived some hemp oil
out of hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp seeds are 30 to 40 percent oil by
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 100 pounds of hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drive 30 to 40 pounds of pure oil
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had some of that and he tested
it out in his engine and he said this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best seed oil that I've ever driven
this car on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Willie came in to do a benefit
concert for me, we poured that hemp oil
[SPEAKER_00]: into my Mercedes diesel and drove it about
110 miles across Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first time in, I guess,
50 to 60 years that any vehicle had ever
[SPEAKER_00]: been driven on hemp oil on the United
States roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Willie told me later on, 12 years
later actually, no, I mean, about 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: later, he says, Gatewood, he says that
afternoon we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It taught me what it was all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason I started my biofuel
company was from what we learned that
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon driving your Mercedes across
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also smoking about the biggest
tutors probably rode in Kentucky at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a caravan of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went from the Hyatt there and Rupp
Auditorium through Frankfurt, the state
[SPEAKER_01]: capital, which is about 80 miles and then
altogether 120 miles all the way into
[SPEAKER_01]: Louisville, which is the largest city in
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he did a big benefit concert for
you there that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
