[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pleased to watch the evolution here,
for example, of this gathering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting down into the nuts and
bolts, new faces, some old friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearing the report from the regulators,
what Steve said, $210 million in the
[SPEAKER_01]: little old Oregon already, things are
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's ironic that Donald Trump's
point person on the drug war chose the
[SPEAKER_01]: week that California opened up the largest
marijuana market in America and the week
[SPEAKER_01]: that Vermont became the first state
through the legislative process to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize, to try and upset the apple cart,
to attack state legal industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to cast a shadow over the
progress that is taking place now in 30
[SPEAKER_01]: states around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am excited about what you've done,
what's happened with the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started this, it was one out
of three, maybe, in the polls that thought
[SPEAKER_01]: that we ought to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We watched that move.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last polls I've seen, actually,
a majority of Republicans now support
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at independents and Democrats,
the numbers are off the charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that has remained consistent is
that regardless of how Americans feel
[SPEAKER_01]: about marijuana, they don't think the
federal government should interfere with
[SPEAKER_01]: what states decide they want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is our secret weapon, one of our
secret weapons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going around the country,
as you know, I've been campaigning on
[SPEAKER_01]: these ballot measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very exciting what's happened,
and then the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I would have spent more time in
Arizona if I'd known we were going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have been maybe nine for nine,
but eight out of nine is not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I remind every audience, every
interview I give, in the states where
[SPEAKER_01]: Donald Trump and cannabis were on the
ballot, cannabis got a lot more votes than
[SPEAKER_01]: Donald Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, as you know, thanks to some of
the folks in Colorado, have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: explicit statement from then candidate
Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: About where he stood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably all seen the clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: He very clearly said the states ought to
be able to do what the states are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to help candidate
Trump remember what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that millions of people who voted
for Donald Trump voted for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we are watching all the dire
predictions that the goofy folks that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been arguing against us for years,
they've fallen apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 states have moved into this space,
including, I'm very pleased with what some
[SPEAKER_01]: of you have helped bring about in Oregon,
Washington, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun still sets in the west.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big rocks haven't fallen out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Children still go to high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happened is we've watched an $8
billion federal industry emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: 200,000 people employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've watched the industry maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you here have been on the front
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am excited about what we have seen in
the last five years in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: D.C., having people from this industry
making the case, the simple case,
[SPEAKER_01]: of what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to pay fair taxes
with a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hard is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the federal government to respect
the will of millions of voters from Maine
[SPEAKER_01]: to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the insane prohibitions against
clinical research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want cannabis to be done away with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That restricts the opportunities we've got
to mature the industry, to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop important, effective tests for
impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a critical issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, there are 20 million people a
month who use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many people, I mean, I've lost track
of the number of people who've told me
[SPEAKER_01]: that medical marijuana has changed their
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is totally mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that the Veterans
Administration doctors can talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: America's Veterans in states where it is
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just for our Veterans who die too
frequently from overdose, who have been
[SPEAKER_01]: given opioids at a frequency far,
far in excess of the general population,
[SPEAKER_01]: and are denied a medication that can be
transformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're coming into what I think now
is the homestretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was appalled at what Jeff Sessions did,
but the more I reflected on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it made me a failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've been campaigning around the
country, I have made the prediction and a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of bets that this crusade is over
in five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was last year, so I've only got
four years left.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if we all do our job,
thanks to Jeff Sessions, we can cut that
[SPEAKER_01]: time in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got people who are involved that
have not been involved before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more media attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are getting more people in
Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mentioned the
Warbacher-Lumenauer Amendment was easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to get into the continuing resolution than
any other time that we've dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress is pretty much aligned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best Congress we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtually every one of my Democratic
colleagues and now dozens of Republicans
[SPEAKER_01]: are on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's just lay it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Republican leadership would not even
allow us a vote this last year on
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're in reasonably good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: The continuing resolution has the
provision.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, if we ever get around to actually
passing a budget, how quaint is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the Senate side and we've got,
as I mentioned, strong support from the
[SPEAKER_01]: House side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a problem with some people in
key positions who messed with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: who took my veterans access legislation
that passed both the House and the Senate
[SPEAKER_01]: in last Congress and took it out in a
conference committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is probably an area that I'm
spending more time on legislatively than
[SPEAKER_01]: any other.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, I'm trying to make
sure that all my Democratic colleagues are
[SPEAKER_01]: in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge percentage, but they're not
all there and I'm working to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that everybody understands these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, I have communicated with every man
and woman running as a Democrat for
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress and there's a gazillion of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of energy about these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to talk about how it is important for
them to take an unequivocal position.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no problem politically if they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a problem politically if
they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go to my grave convinced that if
Hillary Clinton could have given a
[SPEAKER_01]: coherent answer on cannabis, she'd be
president today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't that I didn't tell her or
that you didn't tell her.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just skittishness.
[SPEAKER_01]: An inauthentic answer of something that
she knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think frankly she played a political
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want people this go-around who aren't
with us, who aren't helpful, who aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: specific, I want them to pay a political
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've zeroed in on a couple of people who
have been extraordinarily unhelpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already had a nice little billboard
in Pete Sessions' district with a veteran
[SPEAKER_01]: asking why Pete Sessions doesn't want him
to have his medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to make sure that this is a
political issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to make sure this is a
political issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, anybody who's got a facility
with customers coming in and out,
[SPEAKER_01]: there ought to be a little vote cannabis
poster.
[SPEAKER_01]: There ought to be voter registration
cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this motivates particularly young
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make sure that that motivation
is active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're starting to have a political
footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are starting to notice an $8
billion industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're watching what is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the politicians are starting to
come around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There ought to be some very specific
conversations about where they stand and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, we need to flood Capitol Hill over
the next few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: With people from the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you, one of the reasons we're
in a more powerful position than we've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever been is because people in today's
cannabis industry have turned out in
[SPEAKER_01]: force.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's making a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're watching the old stereotypes melt
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: People today are serious business people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care deeply about their customers and
their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people I've worked with in Oregon and
around the country really make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make sure that that new face of
the cannabis industry is on display in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking about what the impacts are
having a cloud over financing,
[SPEAKER_01]: over banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The impact of not being able to be taxed
fairly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are powerful spokesmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very powerful spokesmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're continuing with our bipartisan
cannabis caucus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't like what the Republican
leadership has done with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have worked with pro cannabis
Republicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of my co-chairs of the cannabis caucus
are Republicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would have told me 20 years ago
when I'm working on this, that one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first co-chairs of our cannabis caucus
would be an 83 year old Republican from
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaska, I might have taken that bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Don Young is terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dana Rorbach has been tireless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the 280e legislation that Grover
Norquist, famous Republican tax activists,
[SPEAKER_01]: appeared with me when we had our first
press conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grover was there talking about how that
was inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've packaged it and given it to
Carlos Cabello as my partner now in the
House.
He's terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Rhee here a moment ago from Senator
Wyden's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Senator Wyden and I have introduced
comprehensive legislation that would solve
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm excited that there are now dozens
of people who are coming forward with
[SPEAKER_01]: their proposals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're encouraging them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want more voices.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's consistent and it's moving
in the right direction, we think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll continue to build on that
bipartisan platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need you to carry that, not just to
Capitol Hill, not just having serious
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations with candidates when they
pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need you to be able to pull those
people on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at, I had three national industry
phone calls in the aftermath of this
[SPEAKER_01]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the messages that we are delivering
is that bring people from Capitol Hill to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a congressional recess for the
House of Representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm encouraging people to look at what the
recess calendar looks like and use that
[SPEAKER_01]: time to invite members of the House and
Senate across the country to come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the growing obligations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are making a judgment who
have no idea what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more they interact, I think the
better off you're going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you are relentless in making
sure that everybody in the industry meets
[SPEAKER_01]: your high standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have met people who take great pride,
and a number of them use the term,
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to meet the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to meet the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make sure that there is no area
where people are stepping over the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selling product to minors is obscene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to make sure that it does not
happen in Oregon or anyplace else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know most of you are rigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched you in action.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've had some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've read about it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cannot continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an open invitation to upset the
uproar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will come back to haunt us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard Steve talk about leakage of
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to make sure that what I think
we were able to put across in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, I think, the model legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got cooperation from the
legislature, from the state regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had industry leadership.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to make sure that we keep that
commitment, that we all made to the Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the system we're going to abide
by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important that we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you for your help,
for your encouragement, for what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing in an area that I've been involved
with now over 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would have told me in 1973 when we
had our first bill that would have allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: two plants per household, that it would
have taken 44 years to get where we are,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I would have believed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you would have told me 10 years ago
about our rapid progress, the development,
[SPEAKER_01]: the movement, the public support,
I don't think I would have believed that
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a spot now where we can drag it
across the finish line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can work with me so that I'm not a
liar, that we get this done this next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it, and I will work day and night
to be able to make sure that the chair of
[SPEAKER_01]: the House Judiciary Committee is not a
good lot from Virginia, who's not our
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, but Jerry Madler from New York,
who in 77 voted in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: To decriminalize, and who's been with us
every step of the way in the legislation
[SPEAKER_01]: of Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will stop at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will continue to follow through with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We continue to want you to be able to
provide our office with information that
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make sure that we're moving,
not just legislatively, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like we've got shots in Missouri,
in Michigan, New Hampshire, House of
[SPEAKER_01]: Representatives passed a pro-cannabis
legislation this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to keep the pressure up on all of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But accept my thanks, accept my commitment
to work with you to make sure that we do
[SPEAKER_01]: what we need to do legislatively,
politically, and with the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I truly think our time has come
and next year we can get it accomplished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
