[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote this song, let's see, 34 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called the song for Leonard
Piltier and I hate to have to keep singing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but as long as I do, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lonely a minute let me borrow your ear
I'll sing you a song about Leonard Piltier
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gone so long in a federal jail The
innocent victim of a tango tear In South
[SPEAKER_01]: Dakota where the fear was thrown The
president saw us from a mountain of stone
[SPEAKER_01]: They said all people were free to roam
There was a struggle for freedom in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian home How many have gone before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how many more Must be lost to the
Indian war
[SPEAKER_01]: The company spoke to the high command That
we leave the teas to the Indian land To
[SPEAKER_01]: dig for oil and uranium ore And maybe have
to start a little Indian war The orders
[SPEAKER_01]: came from a way on high And if there was a
job for the FBI It won't be hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have to do To just cause a little
trouble and follow it through
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oglala where the spirit did dwell It
was a time that they remembered of Women
[SPEAKER_01]: and children were gathered there But when
the wind blew a warning through the
[SPEAKER_01]: whispering air And Leonard Piltier was one
of those Who came to the call when the
[SPEAKER_01]: time arose Endangerous strangers were
prowling around Bringing trouble to the
[SPEAKER_01]: reservation ground And that was when the
agents made their play In a gunshot battle
[SPEAKER_01]: on a deadly day And three men died in
Lakota land Two FBI and an Indian man How
[SPEAKER_01]: many have gone before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how many more Must be lost to the
Indian war
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Stuntz was a man that died that day
But the eyes of the law didn't see it that
[SPEAKER_01]: way All they cared about was their own
kind Going to get somebody for a capital
[SPEAKER_01]: crime The charge was set for homicide But
Leonard got away to the Canada side Where
[SPEAKER_01]: he lived for a while in the northern town
Till they came up and got him and they
[SPEAKER_01]: brought him back down The judge and the
jury they both agreed Two times murder in
[SPEAKER_01]: the first degree They pounded the gavel
and they rang on the bell They said two
[SPEAKER_01]: times life in a federal cell Citations
came from Washington Congratulations on a
[SPEAKER_01]: job well done Two agents gone is a mighty
price But if you want something bad you
[SPEAKER_01]: gotta sucker a face They took Leonard
Piltier up away in chains All of those
[SPEAKER_01]: years to suffer in pain But all of those
years makes a warrior strong And the
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle of the people goes on How many
have gone before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how many more Must be lost to the
Indian wars
[SPEAKER_01]: When Joe Stuntz was a lower down The winds
did blow with a mighty sound The answer
[SPEAKER_01]: came in the driving ring This man will not
have died in vain For the hollow power of
[SPEAKER_01]: the lock and key Nothing to the power of
the raging sea The lightning strikes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the angry skies That puts the power into
people's eyes Oh the weather is building
[SPEAKER_01]: to a mighty storm And the words in the
wind have come to warn Are once more
[SPEAKER_01]: spoken to your ear Only this time the name
is Leonard Piltier How many have gone
[SPEAKER_01]: before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how many more Must be lost to the
Indian wars
Thanks for watching!
