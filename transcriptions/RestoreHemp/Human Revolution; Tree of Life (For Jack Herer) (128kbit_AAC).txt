[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about all the beneficial uses of
cannabis and hemp and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Oregon, I'm sure you all
know this, just legalized the cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: of hemp, one of the first states to really
go that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it up for Oregon!
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a funky plant with a fiber that is
resistant to rain and mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the strongest plant fiber known to
man, the best rope you'll ever hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the pioneers covered up the wagon
trains with a canvas made of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Washington and Jefferson, they gooed
on their phones and said they'd make the
[SPEAKER_02]: most of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first stars and stripes were sewn on
hemp, the first constitution too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used around the world for food,
fiber, oil, medicine, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can feed the world with the tree of
life and live sustainably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll grow fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't make our paper, but the house
from it is new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to spend growing wild and free,
living the way that we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna leave my children a better world
than my ancestors left me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowers, the female hemp plant,
make the best medicines on Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helps cancer and AIDS patients eat their
food, helps those with depression overcome
[SPEAKER_02]: the blues.
[SPEAKER_02]: For COVID, epilepsy, nausea, insomnia,
stress, neurosis, psychosis, pink PMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the studies have been done,
and all the doctors agree, but they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: make money off this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, because it's free, it grows from
a seed of wild and free life we ought to
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the future is grown in our own
backyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we cut down all the trees,
we won't have nowhere to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll grow fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't make our paper, but the house
from it is new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to spend growing wild and free,
living the way that we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna leave my children a better world
than my ancestors left me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, whoa.
La,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la.
Whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this modern day and age,
when we seem to lack spirituality,
[SPEAKER_02]: this one single plant can bring us back
10,000 years in history.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the Shiva, Puranas, to Jesus,
to Christ, to the Buddha, the pagans,
[SPEAKER_02]: the goddess, the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: To commune with all the animals,
be one with all the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: To realize the god is inside me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the earth is among us, we've got to
take care of the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The earth is the mother that gives life
birth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can be honest with a single green
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we cut down all the trees, we won't
have nowhere to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll grow fields of hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't make our paper, but the house
from it is new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to spend growing wild and free,
living the way that we ought to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to be proud children a better
world than my ancestors left me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la.
Whoa, whoa.
