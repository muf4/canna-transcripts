[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all you guys coming to
support this great, great rally that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have for freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're marching today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're marching for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're marching for freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're marching for our rights to make
things happen in our community.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a group of people out in Harrisburg,
Oregon who decided that they would like to
[SPEAKER_05]: import hemp, excuse me, from Spain through
France.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we did and we had to get the DEA's
permission.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we imported this hemp and then we took
that hemp and we made boards out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really a nice guitar and this is a
really old piece of wood.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wood is older than the guitar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's going on is I've got this piece
of wood that's 20 years old and it has an
[SPEAKER_05]: age today, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was made out of hemp fibers that we
imported from Spain through France.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were able to prove through this
piece of wood right here, or actually
[SPEAKER_05]: medium density fiber board, that we could
actually create medium density fiber
[SPEAKER_05]: board.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that because of that, we have the
ability to change the dynamic in the
[SPEAKER_05]: woods, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we proved this 20 years ago,
but because we do not have anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_05]: world, we do not have enough adequate
supply to actually do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, nobody's growing hemp fields in
the United States unless you run out in
[SPEAKER_05]: Nebraska and get some of the ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we just don't have a real
supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we ever had a supply, I mean tomorrow,
we could be producing boards out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could be turning all the herd in the
inside of the stock into viscose and
[SPEAKER_05]: making chairs for astronauts that would
never break.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we could do things that you
couldn't even imagine, but we actually
[SPEAKER_05]: can't because we've got a big imagination.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the reasons that I keep fighting
and I've been doing this for over 30 years
[SPEAKER_05]: is I believe, I believe, I believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things, folks, you got to
remember that now that we're going towards
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization, we need to stick,
have rights.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can't just accept any
medicine that's out there, any marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: that's out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, normal, especially here locally,
Oregon Normal, they're your consumer's
[SPEAKER_08]: rights organization.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they're the ones that are going
to help you make sure that your medicine,
[SPEAKER_08]: your recreational substance, your
religious substance is yours.
[SPEAKER_08]: So remember that, folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Support Oregon Normal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Support National Normal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're the consumer movement for
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's like we need a consumer
movement now that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: legalized soon here in Oregon 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really need to stay close to that
and watch the medicine that we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And folks, yes, you know, we got to
remember, you know, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: legalized soon, but it's not yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got to be, you know, careful out
there, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone knows how to be careful,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to be really smart about what
you're doing out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's one of the few things that
we have to worry about if you're a
[SPEAKER_08]: cardholder is, you know, not in the
public.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we'd all love right here to smoke
a giant bowl right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Russ, he's looking mighty thirsty
for a bowl.
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now Russ is going to smoke a
bowl because he knows that's against the
[SPEAKER_08]: law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Russ is smart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Russ.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Russ is afraid of jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm afraid of jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should all be afraid of jail,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not for marijuana activists.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't allow us, you know,
you can't use your medicine in jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why would you want to go to jail?
[SPEAKER_08]: So in order to stay out of jail,
folks, we've got, you know, we've got the
[SPEAKER_08]: four sayings to help keep you out of jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once, you know, so I'm going to say these
and I want everybody here to say them
[SPEAKER_08]: after me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when the officer approaches you,
whether you're in your car, on your
[SPEAKER_08]: bicycle, on foot, and anywhere officer
approaches you say, am I free to go
[SPEAKER_08]: officer?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I free to go officer?
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute, we need it louder than that
because the officer didn't hear you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I free to go officer?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I free to go officer?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the next one is, this is important
because they'll try and trick you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to say, I do not consent to any
searches.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, you want to make sure
you're able to contact one of these,
[SPEAKER_08]: someone like myself here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wish to speak to an attorney.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish to speak to an attorney.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember, then the other thing now,
our Supreme Court, US Supreme Court,
[SPEAKER_08]: in their wisdom, they say that you must
speak to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make sense, but who's,
you know, these are just some old folks in
[SPEAKER_08]: Washington DC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So number four is, I wish to remain
silent.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_08]: But not right now, folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all right, and I really want to thank
everybody for coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember, you got to practice these
sayings every day, brushing your teeth
[SPEAKER_08]: when you're riding the Max, riding the
bus, mumbling to yourself, look like one
[SPEAKER_08]: of those people on the bus you don't want
to sit next to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So am I free to go officer?
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I free to go officer?
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, folks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, yeah, like Herb said, I do a lot of
this stuff nationally for 420 radio.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the past five years, I have done 78
appearances in 33 cities across 17 states.
[SPEAKER_09]: Atlanta, Georgia, and Orlando,
Florida, and Joplin, Missouri,
[SPEAKER_09]: and Houston, Texas.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been all across the country here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the same everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pot smokers are the same everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all kind and compassionate,
good, decent, law-abiding people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, except that one law.
[SPEAKER_09]: But other than that, really good people,
and there's no reason any of them deserve
[SPEAKER_09]: to be treated like second-class citizens.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we do this activism, one of the
problems that comes along is people don't
[SPEAKER_09]: take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're marching for pot?
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to legalize weed?
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't there something better to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you think of something more useful
to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let me explain something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a lot of people don't take this
very seriously.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even in our own community sometimes,
they just think it's about getting high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me tell you a little story about my
home state, Idaho.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just got back from Idaho because a
friend of mine named Lindsay Reinhart,
[SPEAKER_09]: who is the chief petitioner for their
medical marijuana bill out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a multiple sclerosis patient.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an incident at school.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some kid got a hold of some weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So naturally, they blamed her kid for
giving it to him, even though there was no
[SPEAKER_09]: evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because she's the top medical
marijuana person, and then sent cops to
[SPEAKER_09]: her house, took her kids away to foster
care, and now she's facing felony charges.
[SPEAKER_09]: That same exact week, there was a case
just across the county where a woman left
[SPEAKER_09]: her three-year-old and her 10-month-old in
the car alone, went back into the house,
[SPEAKER_09]: neglecting the fact that she had a loaded
.45 in the car.
[SPEAKER_09]: The three-year-old got a hold of the
loaded .45 and shot the 10-month-old in
[SPEAKER_09]: the cheek.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did she get her kids taken away from her
for child endangerment?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the cops come to her house and start
to charge her with endangering kids and
[SPEAKER_09]: feel like they need to be put in foster
care?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the multiple sclerosis patient who's
using cannabis as medicine is a danger to
[SPEAKER_09]: her kids?
[SPEAKER_09]: That ain't right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is not just an isolated case.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look up Daisy Bram, B-R-A-M, Daisy Bram in
California.
[SPEAKER_09]: In California, people, where there's
medical marijuana since 1996, she's been
[SPEAKER_09]: charged with child endangerment because
she was breastfeeding and she's a medical
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say, oh, you're passing
cannabinoids through the breast milk to
[SPEAKER_09]: your baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite the fact that breast milk
naturally has cannabinoids in it in the
[SPEAKER_09]: first place, I found five cases in the
past week where children aged four and
[SPEAKER_09]: under had gotten a hold of a loaded weapon
and fired it, either hurting or killing
[SPEAKER_09]: themselves, another kid or an adult.
[SPEAKER_09]: Five cases.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not one of those cases where the parents
charged with child endangerment or neglect
[SPEAKER_09]: or being reckless or any charge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just an accident.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, you left your kid alone with a
loaded weapon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, just an accident.
[SPEAKER_09]: That same week, I found five more cases of
people busted for having a marijuana plant
[SPEAKER_09]: in their home where they were charged with
child endangerment and the kids were put
[SPEAKER_09]: into foster care.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I come out here every year to
march.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I fly coach all over this
country to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why I will not stop until we
have the same equal rights as our beer
[SPEAKER_09]: drinking friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you with me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now remember, activism starts with act.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've done the first thing by acting
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: You went out and did more than 99% of any
cannabis activist ever does.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you put your feet on the street and
you put your face in public showing that
[SPEAKER_09]: you support this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So give yourselves a hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember, this is not where it ends.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have bills in the legislature right now
to reduce the penalties for possession of
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana between one ounces and four
ounces.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have bills to add PTSD to the medical
marijuana conditions.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have bills that would actually just
outright legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they ain't going nowhere unless you
talk to your elected officials.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I know it's like they're not on your
speed dial or nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the first person you're going to
call every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: But talk to this guy, National Cannabis
Coalition.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to this guy, Oregon Normal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to any of the activists, longtime
activists out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure they can turn you on to
Oregon Normal, National Cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: Coalition, SAFER, MPP.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care what acronym you want to put
behind your name, as long as you're
marked.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marching with me for freedom.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's stick together.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to your legislators.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can get positive progress here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one final thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some people at the national
level, and I get to talk to a lot of them
[SPEAKER_09]: on a direct basis, who think Oregon ought
to wait till 2016 to go for legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: They say in 2016 it'll be a slam dunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what I don't understand is why
wouldn't it be a slam dunk?
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if we did try in 2014.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not try the seven foot jumper in 2014?
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it doesn't go in, we'll rebound and
do the slam dunk in 2016.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds right to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's fight for 2014 and let's fight for
2016.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't know about you,
but there are 199 Oregonians getting
[SPEAKER_09]: arrested every month for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember, marijuana's decrim here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything over an ounce is a felony.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's 199.
[SPEAKER_09]: Felony arrests every month.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those people can't wait till 2016.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get the ball done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it in 2014.
[SPEAKER_09]: Legalize it!
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a beautiful day in Portland,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so great to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to follow up on what Russ said,
we are seeing such great, tremendous
[SPEAKER_06]: success all across the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week, St. Louis, Missouri
decriminalized marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Springfield, Missouri decriminalized
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maryland just legalized medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rhode Island just legalized medical
marijuana dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Washington and Colorado legalizing
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: For all adults here in Oregon,
we have a bill 3371 that we hope to get
[SPEAKER_06]: referred into 2014 that will legalize
marijuana for all adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: Allow home-grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The great provision.
[SPEAKER_06]: I encourage you to check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got PTSD added as a qualifying
condition under the Medical Marijuana Act.
[SPEAKER_06]: That passed the Senate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reducing marijuana penalties for 29 grams
to 112 grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's no longer a felony.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's likely to pass this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon's likely to have an unprecedented
success at the Oregon Legislature this
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's done because of activists.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done because of people like you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You call your legislator, and not more
than call your legislator.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just tell your truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, everybody out here has a truth
about cannabis and about how cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't hinder your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps your medical condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you more creative.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't impair your life in any way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You keep spreading that truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: The person after person, your friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that message just spreads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the truth shall eventually set us all
free.
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep coming to marches like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Support Urban Design, 420 Radio,
Normal, Oregon Green Free, National Green
[SPEAKER_06]: Friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody out here is working for the
cause.
[SPEAKER_06]: Campaign for the restoration and
regulation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Support everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, day like this, we're united on May
4th.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to mention you got a smart
phone or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Text NCC to 420-420.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a couple of you win some free t-shirts
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: The free swag.
[SPEAKER_06]: So text NCC to 420-420.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get you some free t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on a beautiful day like this,
may the 4th be with us all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk to you about two things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to ask you to do two things,
OK?
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing is that, you know,
I'm a proud member of the Normal Legal
[SPEAKER_07]: Committee, a national organization to
reform the marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: And our legal committee is about 450
lawyers nationally.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we look after folks that are charged
with cannabis-related offenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do education.
[SPEAKER_07]: And outreach and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But lately, the leaders of Normal,
Alan St. Pierre, the executive director,
[SPEAKER_07]: and Keith Straub, the legal counsel,
have been making public statements that
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't really what Normal's about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan's been saying, for example,
that medical marijuana is a sham.
[SPEAKER_07]: Normal doesn't think medical marijuana is
a sham.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Alan says that publicly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keith says, oh, five nanograms,
that's OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's probably a reasonable
level for driving on the influence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Normal's position at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Normal's been fighting hard to make sure
that there aren't, per se, driving on the
[SPEAKER_07]: influence laws passed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what I'd like you to do,
the first thing I'm going to ask you to do
[SPEAKER_07]: is I want you to write to Alan and Keith.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alan at normal.org, N-O-R-M-L dot
org.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Keith at normal.org, N-O-R-M-L dot
org.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let them know that you heard me talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And ask them to knock it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: To quit saying stuff that's not normal,
OK?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you do that for me?
[SPEAKER_07]: We are, after years of playing defense,
we've been winning.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're moving bills.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm also here on behalf of
Compassionate Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Compassionate Oregon is Anthony Taylor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And gosh, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheryl Smith, the director of
Compassionate Center in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Anthony's been lobbying, not Anthony
Johnson, but Anthony Taylor's been
[SPEAKER_07]: lobbying on behalf of Compassionate
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a bill to add PTSD past the Senate
19 to 11.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a hearing in the
health committee in the House on the 15th.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's going to pass the House.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the governor's going to sign it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to have PTSD,
finally, as a condition that will qualify
[SPEAKER_07]: patients in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I caught up with Russ Belville about a
week after he stopped working with normal
[SPEAKER_07]: and said, what should we do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Russ, you know, in the session,
Russ said, you know, it makes me crazy
[SPEAKER_07]: that in Washington, because this is before
it was legalized, sort of, and not sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: before, but sort of legalized,
in Idaho and even Utah and California all
[SPEAKER_07]: have misdemeanor marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in Oregon, if it's less than an ounce,
it's a violation, but more than an ounce,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a felony.
[SPEAKER_07]: And any amount of hashish or hash oil or
honey oil or anything that's derived from
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant is a felony no matter what the
quantity is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: The Oregon Senate, I want to say 18 to 12,
passed a law that says if it's more than
[SPEAKER_07]: an ounce but less than four ounces,
it's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's less than a quarter ounce of
hashish or hash oil, it's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to go to the House.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to pass the House.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to go to the governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to become the law.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have misdemeanor marijuana
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another bill that the Oregon
Criminal Defense Lawyers Association has
[SPEAKER_07]: worked on that, you know, if you,
I don't know if you know, but,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a lot of people get these
tickets for less than an ounce and just
[SPEAKER_07]: pay the fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And next thing they know, they get a
letter in the mail from the Department of
[SPEAKER_07]: Motor Vehicles or license.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's suspended for six months.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody know anybody that happened to
besides me and John Lucy and Paul Loney?
[SPEAKER_07]: And know anybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyway, trust me, that happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Oregon Senate voted, I kid you
not, 24 to 6 to make it that the license
[SPEAKER_07]: suspension can't happen anymore for less
than an ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that bill is going to go to the House
and it's going to pass the House.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to get signed by the
governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to become the law in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are through playing defense.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are moving laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: All we do is we show up and say,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's either going to be legal this session
or next session or the next election cycle
[SPEAKER_07]: or the election cycle after that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to do things that create a
glide path towards legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're agreeing with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so Anthony Taylor is volunteering his
time lobbying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been volunteering my time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Anthony lives out in McMinnville.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got to drive down to Salem almost
daily.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got expenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: After I'm done talking, I'm going to walk
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got my bicycle helmet here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the bicycle helmet has holes in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's because no change, brothers and
sisters.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need some folding money that we can
contribute to Compassion in Oregon to make
[SPEAKER_07]: the rest of these bills actually become
law.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you and God bless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know, as we all know,
alcohol prohibition didn't really end
[SPEAKER_03]: until the women got involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that's true for cannabis
prohibition, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So although I'm not speaking just to the
women today, I really strongly suggest
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's time for women to step up and
stand next to our brothers who have been
[SPEAKER_03]: fighting this fight for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for it to end.
[SPEAKER_03]: People may not know it, but cannabis
prohibition is over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I keep hearing these large
organizations tell us to wait till 2014,
[SPEAKER_03]: wait till 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired of my brothers and sisters
getting put in jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired of kids being taken from their
families because they choose to use a
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly safe intoxicant after work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am tired of being scrutinized for using
a benign plan as my way to relax in the
[SPEAKER_03]: evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to wait till 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to wait till 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am calling my state legislature every
day and I am telling them it's time for
[SPEAKER_03]: them to support and pass HB 3371.
[SPEAKER_03]: That legalizes cannabis for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't leave anybody out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to have PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to have a card.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do anything but be over
21.
[SPEAKER_03]: Works for me, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do this now if every one of you
makes the call.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do this now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can give you the number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull out your phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull out your phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you the number to call right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free to call.
[SPEAKER_03]: 800-332.
[SPEAKER_03]: That number again is 800-332-2313.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them your zip code.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they hook you up with your
representative, you just have to say one
[SPEAKER_03]: sentence, please support and pass HB 3371.
[SPEAKER_03]: That ends it for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ends it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That bill creates an emergency situation
which would enact the law immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means we don't have to wait till MPP
says we can do it in 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means we don't have to wait till
normal says we can do it in 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means we can do it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you guys got to do is call.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't take a huge amount of us to make
those calls to make this happen because
[SPEAKER_03]: they take the impact of those phone calls
as being the voice of 20 of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine that, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every one of you out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All 100 of you or however many there are.
[SPEAKER_03]: By you making the call, you represent 20
more of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: By making that call, you represent 20
fellow cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's make this happen now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want people to go to jail anymore
for weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cost inefficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just playing wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please join me and call 800-332-2313.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Anna is speaking on House Bill 3371.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, one thing you need to realize about
that is like that's not us getting that
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the legislator getting that
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they need is us to be the foot
soldiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need us to help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's up to us to help them pass what we
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes that's how it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year was Measure 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get that passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is they're looking at
Washington who has already legalized and
[SPEAKER_01]: now they are making a move because they
don't want Washington to make all the tax
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they want Oregonians going to
Washington?
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is drive across the
bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they want that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're being smart right now,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need us to help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Lee Berger also talked about earlier,
PTSD and there's other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get busted once, you can lose your
driver's license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known people that that's happened to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to get that changed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone pay attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's unite today under one banner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normal Women's Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organ, Green, Free, THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the organizations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green Leaf Love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wellness Center.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannibalists.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all out here doing the same damn
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to end prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Anna said, I'm tired, tired,
tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen my people go to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I deal with women every day and men that
cry because their children are taken away.
[SPEAKER_04]: From them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you think medical marijuana is
enough, but it's not enough to protect
[SPEAKER_04]: your parental custody rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will take your baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like Reinhart, is that what her
name is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay Reinhart, she came over here and
spoke here for freedom and they took her
[SPEAKER_04]: baby from her.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you think medical marijuana is
enough?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: When our people are being incarcerated,
when our economy is suffering,
[SPEAKER_04]: while other countries' economies prosper
from industrial hemp, it is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what the biggest complaint as
we moved forward with our House Bill 3371
[SPEAKER_04]: was?
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get complaints from the state
police.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got complaints from the local sheriff
saying, where's our cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is time for us to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You contact your representatives and you
let them know that it is time to move
[SPEAKER_04]: forward with House Bill 3371.
[SPEAKER_04]: To allow us to build colleges and not more
prisons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's send our kids to college.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stop sending our kids and our future
to prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm the grandmother of six
children, three boys, three girls,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm proud as hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I fear every day that they are being
disproportionately not only incarcerated,
[SPEAKER_04]: but racial profiling is a huge problem
across the nation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our prisons are filled with blacks and
whites, and poor whites and brown people
[SPEAKER_04]: like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm tired of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just because we brought
marijuana to this country, God dang guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: we try to do something good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all love it when you're getting high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put us in jail now, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us out, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank Russ and Aiko,
this guy who took over Oregon Normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it lives on, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott, Paul Loney, Lee Berger,
all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to the Cannabis Cafe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, good girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Lucy, law420.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I represent Anonymous as well as Occupy,
as well as the global cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm here today to do is something
really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to help you protect your rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to read a little bit of
information that's on every single one of
[SPEAKER_02]: my business cards back in front that you
need to know when you deal with the cops
[SPEAKER_02]: or you deal with anyone who's trying to
get you in front of the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to listen and repeat it
back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a little call and
response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody know how to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody got that?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember to be polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the critical part of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a jerk to the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hate it more than anything when you
know your rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not wish to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invoke my right to silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish to consult with my attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you remember this, you'll
probably never pay me a dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not wish to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invoke my right to silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish to consult with my attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't remember that, I've got
wristbands.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just say I want my lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cards are over there if anybody needs
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I've got a client in
custody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to go over to the jail and take
care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how John Lucy does, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always working.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always working for freedom and
supporting the many, many great and
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Activists, patients, and people that we
have in this cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_10]: This song is called Medication Recreation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis, ganja, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Education to Medicaid and recreation.
[SPEAKER_10]: No medicine can do nothing quite like
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So please give me my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll see I smoke the kind of weed that
you see in your dreams straight out of
[SPEAKER_10]: high times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, you should see this green.
[SPEAKER_10]: CBDs, LNNs, and that THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you best not forget about that THCV.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so these are the things that your
body may need to help get rid of your pain
[SPEAKER_10]: or maybe cure your disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: So sit back with the sack of the finest
trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll one up and give your body what you
know it needs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis, ganja, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Education to Medicaid and recreation.
[SPEAKER_10]: No medicine can do nothing quite like
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So please give me my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Y'all know I hit that green carpet with
all the pot stars at the Hot Times
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you know where you are?
[SPEAKER_10]: Smoking with my friend LK in that VIP.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's time for oil dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'll take two or three.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and then we'll smoke that J and pass
along those medibles.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen this place?
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, these things are so incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just think about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Weed as far as the eye can see.
[SPEAKER_10]: So come on and legalize and give the
people what they need.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis, ganja, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Educate to medicate and recreation.
[SPEAKER_10]: No medicine can do nothing quite like
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So please give me my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis, ganja, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Educate to medicate and recreation.
[SPEAKER_10]: No medicine can do nothing quite like
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So please give me my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Justin James Bridges.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can check me out at justinjamesbridges

[SPEAKER_10]: Free the weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
