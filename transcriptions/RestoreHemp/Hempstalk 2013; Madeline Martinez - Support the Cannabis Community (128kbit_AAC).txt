[SPEAKER_01]: How about all these great volunteers?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see them up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looney, Greenleaf, Mountain Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the people that make a
difference just like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here today and you're making a
difference, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're not criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me remind you, we are government.
[SPEAKER_01]: People call me all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, Madeline, government screwed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say to them, you're government and
I'm government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your joint down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step away from your oil rig for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And call those sons of bitches that
represent us in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Salem and let them know what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're government, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You and me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're government and we're going to change
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody was really excited
about Eric Holder announcing that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: changing the rules, that he's not going to
arrest us for low level, what they call
[SPEAKER_01]: crimes, possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why he made that announcement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because society has changed their mind
about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now know that it's a bunch of BS what
they've been feeding us for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our brothers and sisters are going to
prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women are losing their children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know about you, but you ladies
out there, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a medical marijuana patient,
should you have to see your babies under
[SPEAKER_01]: supervision?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when someone said to me,
I'm going to take your baby because you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke pot, I would not be able to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we have a woman who came to
Tampa down from Idaho because they took
[SPEAKER_01]: her babies from her because the only
medicine she can use is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is she wrong to use marijuana to stay
alive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear this line from them, from our
opponents.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the children?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Lindsay's children?
[SPEAKER_01]: They took them away from her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get all upset about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really bothers the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it bugs you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't it bother you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't it really upset you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you ladies working to help,
the normal women's alliance, high T.
[SPEAKER_01]: And congressmen, our congressmen,
Earl Blumenauer will be at the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Cafe representing our district.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you'll come to the benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to encourage women across the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're an international organization trying
to lead women to change this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ridiculous, darkonian laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we should not stand up in support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of all of you, because of Paul
Stanford, Paul Loney, everyone,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are here today free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what we want?
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to live in a place like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want our children.
[SPEAKER_01]: My granddaughter's here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want legal help so that we can save our
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have green jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you need a green job today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and we have hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow hemp in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can stop supporting China and
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And support Oregonians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody can have health care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds like a dream,
but dreams come true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to the Cannabis Cafe and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next year, we are going to be
legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to have an initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want all of you to join me in
signing it and getting people to sign it
[SPEAKER_01]: because we are going to change reality for
all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prohibition will be a thing of the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes!
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you guys, please donate to hemp
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help us make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, we can't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need just the part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see the buckets, give money
and clean up after yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drink water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up!
