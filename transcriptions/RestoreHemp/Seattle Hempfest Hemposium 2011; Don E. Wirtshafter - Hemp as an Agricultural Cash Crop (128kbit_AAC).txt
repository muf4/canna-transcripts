[SPEAKER_00]: So what you need to know about industrial
hemp is that we've been able to produce it
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada now for 14 years without
embarrassment, without any stories of kids
[SPEAKER_00]: going in and selling it in the high
schools or any of these problems
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Canadian police have been able to
tell the difference between industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and pot really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our police are no dumber than the
Canadian police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're equally dumb, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could do this here and it's just
political inertia, lack of any inertia in
[SPEAKER_00]: politics right now that have got us stuck
in the mud and our farmers totally
[SPEAKER_00]: handcuffed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the support we're hearing and
seeing in Congress is from these farm belt
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these farmers hear Canadian radio
and they understand that farmers up north
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing really well on this crop and
they want a piece of the action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do it here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
