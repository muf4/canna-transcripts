[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, this is LK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm backstage at Hempstok 2012 with Jim
Page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've been involved with
trying to help get it legal here,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know a couple of years ago you
did the Octa Tour, and now you're here for
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempstok.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want to tell people that you
might know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I played the original Hemp Fest up
in Seattle, too, and I played most of
[SPEAKER_01]: those throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known Vivian for ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the most interestingly direct
action, constructive people that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the 60s generation, and so I kind
of came of age in the era when people were
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging all kinds of prohibitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a musician, which means I've been
around all sorts of substance abuses,
[SPEAKER_01]: including mostly alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know what that does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen what that does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the casualties over and over for
years in the music community and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: civilian community associated with music
and so on and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's a broken record to say
over and over again that cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it, eating it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the worst I've ever seen is
somebody might go to sleep, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they might start seeing little sparkly
things and talk about flying saucers or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to get into fistfights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't steal your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you start to get into the whys
and wheres of the prohibition and things
[SPEAKER_01]: were changed and locked away, it just
starts to be kind of boringly the same as
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else in this country that gets
hidden away and kept out of our grasp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can get actually close to
changing it, I think that's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've learned to expect the worst,
but I would love to see the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I personally think that people
are better than we're than we're allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to think, smarter than we're allowed to
think, more generous than we're allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always prepared for that big letdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I got my fingers crossed on
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I know that measure 80 was here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the opportunity to make it legal
for recreational use amongst adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first state to decriminalize
and look where it came.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can pass this and make it legal
in Oregon, no no telling where it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might have already answered
this, but I always ask everyone I
[SPEAKER_00]: interview this one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could say anything to the marijuana
community, what would you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say don't make a fool of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say don't don't you know,
don't be confrontational, but keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let people shut you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, don't let people put you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let people tell you how stupid you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going because it's a totally sensible
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, when it was decriminalized,
so to speak here in Oregon, did the murder
[SPEAKER_01]: rate go up?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, violent crime actually came
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that you think your fans would
like to know where you're going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm playing all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always do a West Coast tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tour up and down the coast like twice a
year, once in the spring, once in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm looking forward to November is
the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I'd like to say,
which people talk about a lot and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: said this before, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not an advocate of any
particular use of anything, but cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's it's an unlocking agent,
among other things.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I be blunt?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, the first time I took acid,
OK, way back when the funny because that
[SPEAKER_01]: acid makes you laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it make it doesn't allow you to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you will laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that is the most funny that
I remember is pomposity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pomposity is the funniest thing on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you learn to laugh at pomposity,
the game is almost up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can tell you what to do and
what to think and where to sit down and
[SPEAKER_01]: when to shut up and everything else with
their big uniforms and their badges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're pompousness once you start to
laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I'm saying is that some of these
things are unlockers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They unlock your creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They unlock your sense of humor and they
allow you to see the ludicrousness of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain kind of superiority.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I don't know how to fix guitars,
so I bow to the authority in that sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: the word of a guitar repairman when mine
gets broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only definition of authority
that I give any any credence to the other
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not an authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just got a gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put me away for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's force.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can get things square and
straight with our terminology and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: learn to laugh at the right time and we
can understand that unlocking our brains
[SPEAKER_01]: can be dangerous to some other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we understand why they don't like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We allow people to slowly but surely
understand that we're not endangering
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The murder rate is going to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world isn't going to fall apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: The earth isn't going to hit with
asteroids, dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, it's going to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we might even get some
constructive things done.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, very nice, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this OK backstage at Hempstock 2012
with Jim Page, one of the most wisest men
[SPEAKER_00]: I ever heard after just hearing this
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for everything you've
done in the past and what you'll do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just an honor to interview you,
sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
