[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to talk about something that
I think not many people here are aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: is that there is another Industrial Hemp
Farming Act in Congress, and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced in May by Representative Ron
Paul, and it already has more co-sponsors
[SPEAKER_00]: than we've ever had on an Industrial Hemp
Farming Act bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I believe, the third bill that
has been introduced by Representative Ron
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul, and that's because of the hard work
of a group called Vote Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Vote Hemp is a pretty much
single issue focusing just on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial Hemp side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Steenstra, who's the president of
Vote Hemp, this year finally got on board
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of us who've been urging for
longer than more than a year that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time to hitch our star to moving medical
and recreational legislation, and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: have worked with the proposition folks in
California, in Colorado, here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're including Industrial Hemp now as
comes under the, will come under the same
[SPEAKER_00]: initiatives and legislation that's moving
around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the last 10 years, surprisingly,
we've worked totally separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: People working on medical, people working
on industrial have worked separately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think the big change in the last 12
months since we were sitting on this stage
[SPEAKER_00]: a year ago is that there's a new openness
towards including Industrial Hemp with
[SPEAKER_00]: what really is a more popular issue,
and that is medical cannabis recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the East Coast, if you say cannabis,
people's eyes blaze over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually don't know what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a bit of ignorance still as
to what is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say marijuana and 95% of the people
know what you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm just gonna say that there is,
on the East Coast, a deficit of knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: on this issue, and what our biggest
challenge is is to continue to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians that go to Washington to write
laws that this is a safe issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Industrial Hemp issue, and it's
probably now the whole issue is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just Industrial Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even the idea of just tax and
regulate, so I'll leave it there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is this bill in Congress,
the Industrial Hemp Farming Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really hope if you haven't already
called your congressman in the last month,
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't been calling enough,
so give him a call, or her a call,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask them to support that bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
