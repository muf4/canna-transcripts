[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a righteous message to the
world that Seattle Hempfest is taking
[SPEAKER_00]: place on this beautiful day and we're
peaceful, we're proud, and we're calling
[SPEAKER_00]: it out loud saying, end marijuana
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will never stop responsibly protesting
until the day that everybody goes free and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the doors open from the prisons and
our brothers and sisters come out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: cages into the sun, into the air,
and that the patients can be wheeled down
[SPEAKER_00]: with their IVs on their hospital beds and
celebrate the victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole world, you know, we get,
we've had media at Hempfest Central.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, that's our store, Hempfest
Central, at 12351 Lake City Way Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 21 years of operating grassroots to
our ass roots out of our homes,
[SPEAKER_00]: completely decentralized, we realized we
couldn't do a 22nd year like that and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have offices now and a little storefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to pay the rent and all that
stuff and pay this bill here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had media visits, television and
newspaper media from BBC, Al Jazeera
[SPEAKER_00]: English, CNN, ABC, NBC, Mexican,
Japanese, French, Russian media have all
[SPEAKER_00]: shown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday I talked to Russia Today on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on CNN, television, live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole world is watching Seattle
leading the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proving we're not violent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a beautiful, mellow, spiritual,
artistic community of Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're individuals and we're not a threat
to anything except a bag of potato chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to start speaking our
truth to power, no matter how stressful or
[SPEAKER_00]: exhausting or intimidating it is to throw
a Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to risk it all as long as they
let us do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways they're going to let
us do it is if we all can clean this place
[SPEAKER_00]: up, get out of here safely with nobody
hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, you guys, for 22 years
of peaceful protest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frankly, it's just incredibly,
it's as beautiful as you all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
