[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things we were discussing
just a little while ago was Henry Ford's
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made an external body with hemp fiber
and oil and some other seed oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got videos on our website and have
for 10 years where they swing a sledge
[SPEAKER_00]: hammer at it and it bounces off and it
doesn't scratch the body of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a prelude to fiberglass,
but perhaps a better alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hemp glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ford was a total pioneer and we cover
pieces of his life in the film.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that Ford did around
that same time that he built Grown is he
[SPEAKER_01]: actually created an ethanol facility in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was turning hemp and other products
into ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there was a guy at that time named
Rockefeller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standard Oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good friend of Andrew Mellon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secretary of the Treasury for several
administrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and this is all during the time of
Hearst and this whole sort of global power
[SPEAKER_01]: play was starting to be created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ford had a completely different
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only did he grow his car, but he
wanted to grow fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his ethanol facility got about 25% of
the fuel market in the Midwest and
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockefeller said, we've got to do
something about this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rockefeller started funding something
that became known as the Women's Christian
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperance Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, I've heard of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was what, circa 1930 or 25?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right before Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1915 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you recall, you know, soon after
that, the Women's Christian Temperance
[SPEAKER_01]: Union got together and they created this
push for people to stop drinking alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which then turned into... To ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which most people don't know that the
amendment to the Constitution that was
[SPEAKER_01]: called Prohibition was actually funded by
Rockefeller, not having to do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: with drinking alcohol, but to make sure
that Ford would stop producing alcohol.
Ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that kind of ties some
strings together there that have flung
[SPEAKER_00]: loosely in the wind in terms of eventually
leading to marijuana prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole biodiesel issue is something
that we've talked about on this show at length.
