[SPEAKER_00]: Wild seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeding life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the earth is our mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the land is her flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water is her milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the oil is her blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are her children.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this land we come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this earth we are made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: With us as future ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: To live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the future we bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can the land take care of us?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't take care of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the air we breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to remember tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the reality of what we reap.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we sow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is in the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And life is in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed has memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Memory of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild seed memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Face to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the destroyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their synthetic seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toxic poisoning of land and mines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disregarding well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intermaximizing profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abandoning children to massive deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making the price of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unaffordable at the expense of the big.
[SPEAKER_00]: To benefit the few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a spreading mad human disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chaosing minds with liar's promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeding old fears with new fears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in the world of the money man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to think our way out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we believed our way into.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we show respect to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't use our common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeding life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the earth is our mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the land is our flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water is her milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the oil is her blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are her children.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Trudell and Mad Dog one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Trudell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
