I love it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the little cut toe and you want to
have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have everything signed and sealed
because the color of my skin borrows
[SPEAKER_01]: before I will appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say Babylon, I've come to chop at your
shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: River.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say I ain't going nowhere, no time soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Destruction of the earth, the rising of
the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You plant in your garden and wish it would
bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're chanting Satan's truths as they
flow.
Oh, so far away, go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hear what I say, so gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said so gone, gone, gone.
So far away, go.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother Earth was meant for men and women
to stay, but I see so many of you drifting
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Children can't even find a place to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't find no seats in the horses,
no hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the weepers weeping and it's every
single day I see the searchers searching
[SPEAKER_01]: for a brighter way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Babylon, can you hear what I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, things going nowhere, no time soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Destruction of the earth, the rising of
the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Land in your garden and wish it would
bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chanting Satan's dreams is never gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far away, gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't you know we're gonna get it one
day?
[SPEAKER_01]: So gone, I said, so gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give me a microphone and I will talk
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say the people here in Ashland know they
are my friends and they will be until the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh and I say, what then?
[SPEAKER_01]: The writing on the wall, what is the
message you send?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's what will not be in my bread
trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Babylon will never see the rising of
the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, so gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
I said, so gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
So far away, gone.
