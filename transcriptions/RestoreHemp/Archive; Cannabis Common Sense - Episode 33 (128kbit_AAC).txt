[SPEAKER_01]: Video tape live at the studios of City
Video at the Rage Nightclub.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time for Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show that tells you the truth about
marijuana and the politics behind its
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's the host of the show,
Paul Stanford and Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Paul Stanford and I'm Paul
Loney.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here with the campaign for the
restoration and regulation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're an Oregon political committee that's
circulating a petition, the Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Tax Act, which will tax and
regulate the sales of marijuana to adults
[SPEAKER_02]: and allow medicinal marijuana and
completely legalize industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as our tagline beginning the show
says, this is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to tell you the truth and our
petition is about telling the truth and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the truth back out there,
which is why we would call our political
[SPEAKER_00]: action committee to restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to restore hemp to its rightful
place, to its truthful place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hemp produces more fiber,
protein and oil than any other plant on
[SPEAKER_02]: this planet and our petition will allow
Oregon farmers to cultivate this valuable
[SPEAKER_02]: crop and allow Oregon industries to
develop sustainable products and
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the entire crop will be purchased by
the Oregon Liquor Control Commission and
[SPEAKER_00]: then be sold to state-run stores and
packaged that way for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that also would, they would
package it to pharmacies and control it
[SPEAKER_00]: for pharmacies and so we would work that
way with it, which would help patients who
[SPEAKER_00]: need it for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it would also allow doctors to
prescribe it through those pharmacies and
[SPEAKER_02]: that wouldn't be taxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The marijuana in pharmacies would be sold
at cost, so it would be very inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sales to adults through the state
liquor store system, we would have a tax
[SPEAKER_02]: on the sales of the product to adults and
through any bars or public houses that
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to add marijuana as something,
as long as they bar miners from entering
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have a license, they could be
supplied by the OLCC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually changed the name of the OLCC
to the Oregon Intoxicant Control
[SPEAKER_02]: Commission rather than the Oregon Liquor
Control Commission because we'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: including cannabis in their wares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would make more sense anyways
because the Oregon Liquor Control
[SPEAKER_00]: Commission right now does deal with
certain medical drugs in it packaged as
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor as medicine for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then also what we really want to
point out is that this does allow,
[SPEAKER_00]: this question always comes up,
it does allow people to grow at home
[SPEAKER_00]: because we classify seeds and starts as
hemp and hemp would be not regulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: this initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be allowed to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as in the Netherlands today,
the cultivation of hemp as marijuana for
[SPEAKER_02]: personal use and the sales of seeds and
small plants and starts or cuttings would
[SPEAKER_02]: be legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you wouldn't be mandated to go
through the state system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since most people who smoke tobacco
don't grow their own tobacco, we would
[SPEAKER_02]: guess that there would still be a pretty
open market through the liquor store
[SPEAKER_02]: system and local taverns and public
houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely, because not everybody
has a green thumb, let's face it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not everybody wants to take
responsibility of watering a plant on a
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly basis or whatever and having to
worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you just want to pop down to the
local store and buy some or go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: local public house and enjoy a little bit
with their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what this is all about,
is basically restoring freedom and freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I want to make clear right
up front is sure, we like to see public
[SPEAKER_00]: houses open up after this initiative
passes, but it's still illegal under this
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive under the influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the influence of anything,
it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to make that perfectly
clear to start off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm real happy that this does cover
the medical purposes for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there use marijuana on
a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people only use it on a weekly basis
when the need strikes, but they do need
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for a medical purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this addresses that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes them out of the black market,
out of the hands of the common criminals,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of their hands of trying to grow it
for themselves and says, OK, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat it like a regular herb,
a pharmaceutical herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would allow the sale through
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people would be certain that
they're getting medicinal quality
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana through pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing that through a petition
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, we have closing in on
almost 20,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to turn in about 100,000
signatures because we need 73,261 valid
[SPEAKER_02]: registered Oregon voter signatures signed
to put this on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need your help to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been sending out a lot of petitions
in the past month.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've mailed out well over 1,300.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been lobbying our liquor store
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help to put this on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've only got until July of 1998 to get
the rest of the signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you can only get one signature,
your own, or you want to get your friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you want to help us by coming to
something like the Rolling Stone Concerts
[SPEAKER_02]: on January 30th and 31st, we'll be
staffing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to come out and help us in
public, please give us a call at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our office is manned from 10 AM to 3 PM,
Monday through Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find us in there a lot of the times
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have an extensive voicemail system
that can handle over 100 calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please call us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to send you this petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and if you're outside of the
Portland viewing area, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's area code 503.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Rolling Stones Concert is up here
in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely it should be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting people together to go out
there and petition in teams on both
[SPEAKER_00]: nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come up for one night or both nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a Friday and Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure afterwards we'll be retiring
to a nice place to have a celebratory
[SPEAKER_00]: drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come on down and help us petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meet some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't do that, like Paul said,
get your own signature, that of your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, that of your parents,
your roommates, whoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need all the signatures we can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, let's call and get those petitions at
the number on your screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's area code 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have access to the internet at your
home, at the library, or through a local
[SPEAKER_02]: university or school, you can look at our
website at www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even print these petitions right
from the internet and watch streaming
[SPEAKER_02]: videos and other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we urge you to look at our website,
because it's just chock full of
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a news archive of stories on
cannabis from around the world that goes
[SPEAKER_02]: back to 1992 that's mirrored in the
Netherlands and other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so please help as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight we were going to have a guest on
our show, a victim of the Marijuana Task
[SPEAKER_00]: Force, a victim of an illness that needs
marijuana, needs cannabis to help out with
[SPEAKER_00]: those symptoms of that illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been Diane Densmore,
who probably a lot of you have heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a victim of the Marijuana Task
Force.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ran the Cannabis Buyers Club,
a local version of it here, which helped
[SPEAKER_00]: out people here who needed as their drug
of missal need and missal help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she can't be here because she's
suffering from some medical problems right
[SPEAKER_00]: now due to the fact that the police have
harassed her and she can't get access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually I talked to her this
evening, and she was the person who was
[SPEAKER_02]: running the alternative health clinic here
in Portland and was busted, I guess it was
[SPEAKER_02]: in late September initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they came back in late October and
busted her again and took her to jail for
[SPEAKER_02]: over a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They held her in there and I'm sure most
of you feel a lot safer because this lady
[SPEAKER_02]: Diane Densmore was locked up, but she is
now having to take a urinalysis test at
[SPEAKER_02]: least once a week, call in daily seven
days a week down to the Multnomah County
[SPEAKER_02]: Jail and their supervisors and report
periodically to them upon demand and to
[SPEAKER_02]: undergo urinalysis testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because that she can't use her
medicine and she's doing really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really poorly, she says her cardiac
problems are starting to increase and
[SPEAKER_02]: she's got a number of other medical
problems and she's under an incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she misses her friends, the people she
used to work with in the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: She really said she was missing some of
those folks, so if you want to get in
[SPEAKER_02]: touch with Diane Densmore and give her
some support, give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can put you in touch with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: She couldn't make it tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully she'll be back with us in mid to
late January when we tape again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully she'll be feeling a little
bit better and can give us a report
[SPEAKER_02]: directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just really a shame that the
police had to spend all of our tax dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: on this and they had a multi-month
surveillance on the internal health
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent in undercover police numerous
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent in street informants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is they had a real doctor
write up real notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know why this doctor did this,
whether this doctor was pressured because
[SPEAKER_00]: he was under some sort of suspicion
himself for some sort of crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whether the doctor is a drug warrior
and wanted to take part in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, then he's writing,
you know, false notes in which he should
[SPEAKER_00]: report it to the state licensing board of
medicine to figure out why this guy is
[SPEAKER_00]: writing phony prescriptions for
non-existent elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of questions there that
haven't been answered by the local police
[SPEAKER_00]: department or the local district attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would suggest, you know,
calling the local district attorney's
[SPEAKER_00]: office up, Multnomah County's attorney's
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in the Tri-County area,
if you're in the blue pages of the phone
[SPEAKER_00]: book, under Multnomah County district
attorney's office, call them up and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, why are you folks prosecuting Diane
Dinsmore and others?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just her.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other people as well that were
arrested, you know, from this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: fallout, this marijuana task force.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a travesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They arrested some of the people who were
helping there, volunteering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a shame that very ill people,
people who were dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the alternative health clinic,
few of their patients would be dying every
[SPEAKER_02]: week or a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people who have cancer and
advanced HIV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found that cannabis helped them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis helped the cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy restore their
[SPEAKER_02]: appetite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis helped the AIDS patients restore
their appetite that were suffering from
[SPEAKER_02]: the wasting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to go in and arrest the people
providing relief to these people,
[SPEAKER_02]: to me, seems particularly evil and cruel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, some of the officers
involved in that have questionable ethics,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of officers, though, support
innovations like the Oregon Cannabis Tax
[SPEAKER_02]: Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to make certain that they
don't have to go out and arrest
[SPEAKER_02]: non-violent, family-raising adults using
marijuana in the privacy of their home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times, we have law enforcement
officers sign our petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we urge you to help us put this on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call and get the petition at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call us and get the petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'd be amazed at how many of
your friends have already signed this
[SPEAKER_00]: petition or would be willing to sign it as
soon as they see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, you know, still don't
know it exists out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need your help to help get the worry
out that, hey, there's a petition out
[SPEAKER_00]: there to make cannabis legal and regulated
in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we can be the leaders once
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon is known as being the leader for
many things, and especially in health
[SPEAKER_00]: care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, right now, talk about,
you know, with Diane Dinsmore and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other folks arrested, I mean, it was just
a travesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Portland police come in, spend all
that money, and there's no, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: no complaints from the public on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all police-generated,
the whole controversy about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, you know, the police,
you know, they didn't say they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting calls from the public to go out
and bust these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had gotten some publicity for
running the alternative health center,
[SPEAKER_00]: for providing cannabis for people who
desperately needed it as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the police didn't, you know,
they created their own crime, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me that they have a political
agenda, at least the officers in the drug
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement units that pursued this case
to arrest medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the district attorney of Multnomah
County, Michael Shrunk, had said that he
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't going to prosecute marijuana cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here he is prosecuting a marijuana
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a politician, I guess,
but we'd like to point out that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some people say that marijuana
is medicinally available over the counter
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a substance called Maranol
that contains one of the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_02]: substances that's in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It contains THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other non-psychoactive and
psychoactive substances in marijuana that
[SPEAKER_02]: have medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD or cannabidiol, is a anti-spastic
agent that stops multiple sclerosis
[SPEAKER_02]: patients' spasms very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're undergoing a spasm with multiple
sclerosis, you can't swallow a Maranol
[SPEAKER_02]: pill and wait an hour and a half for it to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few hits of marijuana help multiple
sclerosis patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the British Medical Association just
noted that in a survey and an article they
[SPEAKER_02]: had in the British Medical Journal saying
that marijuana should be medicinally
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act,
the question itself says exactly,
[SPEAKER_02]: yes vote, permit state license,
cultivation, and sale of marijuana for
[SPEAKER_02]: medical purposes and to adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really stresses the medical aspects of
our initiative because we set up a number
[SPEAKER_02]: of medical studies through the Oregon
Health Sciences University and other
[SPEAKER_02]: medical research facilities here in the
state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of that's funded through the
taxation of the recreational sale of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our initiative will help medical
patients not only get medicinal marijuana,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also access the health they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you stop and think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, smoking marijuana is the best
delivery control substance for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, much better than a pill,
as you said, that you pill, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have difficulty of swallowing
sometimes, the time it takes for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: break down your stomach, then to go
through the stomach wall, the lining into
[SPEAKER_00]: your bloodstream, and then to the muscles
that need it or the nerves or wherever it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus smoking, it's always bad to put
things in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's the only choice you have,
in your lungs right away, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting the oxygen and blood mixes
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within minutes, you know, it's where it
needs to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the patients that take Marinal
complain that an hour and a half later,
[SPEAKER_02]: they either are too stoned, that the
effects strike too suddenly and too
[SPEAKER_02]: intensely, or they don't get that effect
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they really can't get an effective
dose very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't measure it too well orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the best delivery control substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get back to a point you made
about Michael Shrunk, the local DA,
[SPEAKER_00]: being a politician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is, you know, and, you know,
I've heard him interviewed on a talk show,
[SPEAKER_00]: a radio talk show here in town,
and he basically said that I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: politician, and right now, marijuana is
against the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, you know, obviously he left
it open that the law has changed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he'll be supportive of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Shrunk is not going to be out in
front of the band leading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think that Michael Shrunk
should be, and, you know, his job as a
[SPEAKER_00]: politician, and he's not going to be out
in front of the band, which is where we
[SPEAKER_00]: come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to lead the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, a majority of people
here in Oregon want to have medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we can do that through this
petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people like Michael Shrunk will
just say, okay, it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is what the people have
spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we can do this with this
initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I just, I was going to say,
you know, Michael Shrunk is a politician,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's being pushed around by the police
department here, certain numbers of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I heard a report recently that
Michael Shrunk actually admitted that he
[SPEAKER_02]: had a very ill relative up in Washington
State that was undergoing chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that he actually procured and supplied
marijuana to this very ill relative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, now, his office is in charge of
prosecuting a number of very ill people
[SPEAKER_02]: that, like his relative, needed marijuana
to help save their lives and treat their
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether that's true or not,
but still, though, I mean, it just shows
[SPEAKER_00]: you that if Michael Shrunk was saying it
earlier, he wouldn't prosecute these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was presented by the police
department in such a high-profile case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a very high-profile case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a deputy DA that really wants to
pursue it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but he was presented to them by the
police department.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it would have been just one little
person growing and given to a few others,
[SPEAKER_00]: he could have, you know, had to fall
between the cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because the police spent so much time
on it, so much money, so many officers
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this, and two, you know,
well-publicized raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, both raids were, you know,
Oregonian front-page news, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on every channel in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that he had, he couldn't just
ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to go ahead and prosecute this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the police pushed him into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain members of the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain members of the police,
you know, don't believe in your rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the simple, sad fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most police officers do believe
in your rights, but some don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the ones that are,
you know, pushing around the DA's office,
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another thing that our ballot title
says specifically on the medical issue is
[SPEAKER_02]: that the Commission will sell marijuana at
cost to pharmacies and medical research
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're here, is to get you
involved in the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: So call us, please, at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get these petitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're outside of the Portland area,
call 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be happy to send you out one,
two, a dozen, 50 petitions, however many
[SPEAKER_02]: you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know because we need your help to
put this on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that's important that the
Commission will sell us medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to licensed research facilities because
one of the first things that Ronald Reagan
[SPEAKER_00]: did when he came into office, he cut off
all funding for research for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, that researchers are
dependent upon funding, usually federal,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the research, especially in medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't do research, you don't
keep your job as a professor at a
[SPEAKER_00]: university, or you don't get tenure to
keep your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to keep doing your
research and keep publishing papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as Ronald Reagan cut off the
federal funding for cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: every researcher just dropped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can present to them,
at a reasonable cost, medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, there'll be a lot more
researchers back into the subject here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they cut off the supply to get legal
marijuana for medicinal purposes for a
[SPEAKER_02]: study.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get permission from NIDA,
the National Institute of Drug Abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And NIDA hasn't granted permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one study that was going to go
forward done at the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: California at San Francisco Medical
School.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wanted to study the effects of
marijuana on HIV-infected patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Dr. Abrams there, Donald Abrams,
sought permission to receive legal medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his study was funded all through,
but NIDA, and approved at a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different levels, but NIDA denied access
to medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's difficult for these researchers not
only to get funding, but they can't even
[SPEAKER_02]: get the substance from the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said that this one here,
because we'll provide it to licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: research facilities at cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's going to open up a boom in
research for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of states allowed medical
marijuana, but they never provided a
[SPEAKER_02]: method to supply medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, 36 states including Oregon had
medical marijuana at one time or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over, I think it's 26 now, have medical
marijuana today legally allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But only in California are they allowing
patients to cultivate their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only place where there
really is a system of delivery for
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, though, every researcher
who's actually studied this has said that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically there's enough research out
there already that says that cannabis does
[SPEAKER_00]: work for a number of illnesses,
whatever you want to call it, a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: for the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that every time they do a
research, they just go ahead and catalog
[SPEAKER_00]: all the past studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're doing it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: National Institute of Medicine,
the National Science Foundation,
[SPEAKER_02]: is just doing another one at the behest of
the federal drug czar because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: passage of the bills in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Arizona, they want to come up
with another one because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: pressured into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were denying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now they can say, well,
actually we're doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cataloging all the past research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing new research.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're doing a few forums around the
country, one of them in Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_02]: New Orleans, and a final one in
Washington, DC, where they're allowing all
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of public input.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of the researchers actually are
from Oregon Health Sciences University.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are only five researchers involved
on the project, and two of them are from
[SPEAKER_02]: right here in Portland at the Oregon
Health Sciences University.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, our initiative is what we
hope is going to allow patients to legally
[SPEAKER_02]: get medical marijuana through pharmacies,
and I think that's a big breakthrough for
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it is going to be a big
breakthrough for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so many people, you know,
the idea that they can just go to a local
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacy and get it with their
prescription is so much better than I
[SPEAKER_00]: stated earlier than trying to find some
local dealer that has some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hoping that it's good, clean stuff
because you never know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or no pesticides or who knows what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what they spray on the stuff to,
you know, make it seem better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just that simple, you know,
in their mind they know that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a travesty, you know,
that we don't know about this medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, why should the government tell you
what is medicine, what isn't medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're all adults enough to make
up our own minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get our petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the solution that we keep working
at here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we urge you to call us and get these
things at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to be redundant, but we do need
your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without your help, we might not make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need everyone's help.
[SPEAKER_02]: That possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so give us a call at 235-4606 and get
a petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some of these and get, help us get
some signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's just your own, we'll be happy
to send you one if you just want one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And help us put this on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I'm sure, you know,
most of you out there watching this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, have known of somebody
personally who has been helped by medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in some way or somebody with
multiple sclerosis or chemotherapy or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, wasting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just, you know, horrible pains from all
the chemical exposures.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, that's a new one coming up with
these chemical toxic exposures people have
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis helps to relieve that total
all over body pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning sickness and menstrual cramps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis was actually prescribed back to
Queen Victoria over 100 years ago for
[SPEAKER_02]: menstrual cramps and was used for that for
many, many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, marijuana isn't allowed for
morning sickness and menstrual cramps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the areas where it has been studied
in conjunction with pregnancy and women's
[SPEAKER_02]: health issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they found that it has increased the
birth weight of babies and had no
[SPEAKER_02]: detrimental effects upon women's
reproductive systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they did that extensive study down
in Jamaica on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problems at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually the mothers that smoked high
amounts of cannabis in Jamaica had
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier babies, higher birth weights,
less problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, we know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, earlier this century, you know,
cannabis tinctures were the rage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because people knew it worked so
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've told you the truth, hopefully,
about medical cannabis and we hope you
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we urge you to, one last time,
give us a call and get this petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some research on this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let our university scientists study
marijuana and find out the truth about its
[SPEAKER_02]: links to women health issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's end the Probe edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let truth get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks and good night.
