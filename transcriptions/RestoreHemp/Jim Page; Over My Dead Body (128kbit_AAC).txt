[SPEAKER_00]: We are born of nature, and in nature we
will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and if we don't make it, it's not
because we didn't try.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not because we didn't try.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they will incorporate the world
over my dead body, over my dead body,
[SPEAKER_00]: over my dead body, over mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all the money, we have the will,
and I would rather be a match than a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would, yes, I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the guns, all we are is flesh
and blood, but we will multiply our
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and drown them in our flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we will, yes, we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they will incorporate the world
over my dead body, over my dead body,
[SPEAKER_00]: over my dead body, over mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all the power, that's what they
say, but we will turn those tables,
[SPEAKER_00]: take their power away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we will, yes, we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not be dissuaded, and we will not
turn around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will face the barricades, and we will
tear them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we will, yes, we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they will incorporate the world
over my dead body, over my dead body,
[SPEAKER_00]: over my dead body, over mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call me a fool, that's all right
with me, I will live to see this good
[SPEAKER_00]: round.
[SPEAKER_00]: World breaking free, yes, I will,
yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they will incorporate the world
over my dead body, over my dead body,
[SPEAKER_00]: over my dead body, over mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they will incorporate the world
over my dead body, over my dead body,
[SPEAKER_00]: over my dead body, over mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
