[SPEAKER_00]: Here is our show-and-tell, our sharing for
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first thing is a specific medicine
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it says American Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it's great, I'll read the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says great for nervous depression,
irritation of the genitourinary tract,
[SPEAKER_00]: painful micturation, and are used for
scalding, burning, frequent to low mental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, wakefulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just recommended for just about
everything, and it's got a date on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says American Hemp is considered an
anodyne, hypnotic, antispathenotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: producing sleep even when opium and
morphine fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficient in delirium tremens,
which is what alcoholics get, infantile
[SPEAKER_00]: convulsions and fevers, neuralgia,
gout, rheumatism, low mental conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: insanity, and inflammatory conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often preferable to opium and where
opium disagrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it says on this jar right
there in tiny letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this one is from a currently
operating company, Park Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in a solid powdered extract,
and you see it has about half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: containers are still in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from 1910, says Indian Cannabis on
this little label in the back,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a Park Davis product produced in
Detroit, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is powdered hashish, or keef,
we often call it, but they call it
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered extract of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it is another powdered
extract of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it away from the leaf a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, back the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there, that's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So powdered, this one's from Eli Lilly,
and I have a series of Eli Lilly products
[SPEAKER_00]: here that are going to the Cannabis Museum
in Athens, Ohio here in short order,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is a specific powdered cannabis
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right next to it from the Merrill
Company is also a powdered extract of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of these jars were made to hold,
one, two, three, an ounce of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this one even says right on the
back, one ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this one's empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only one that has some of the
contents in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it here, maybe you can close
in a little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chloridine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloridine was a medicine for pain and
sleep, and it's also from Eli Lilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cannabis, morphine, peppermint,
chloroform, and caspicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has a lot of different things in
this Chloridine from Eli Lilly and Indian
[SPEAKER_00]: apolis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was used for pain and spasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it, like I said again, it has
morphine, cannabis, capsicum, chloroform.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff will just knock you out
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right next to it, we have another Eli
Lilly product, Cannabis Tincture Number
[SPEAKER_00]: 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eli Lilly, Park Davis, these guys each had
over two dozen different cannabis products
[SPEAKER_00]: that were slightly different in the
extracting agent and the contents and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was their Number 17 Cannabis
Tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it here, we have Number 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it says poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought it was poison for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bottle is from the 1880s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought you could overdose on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was one ounce of cannabis extract
in nine ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine ounces of alcohol is what it says on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a Number 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right here next to it, all a little
bigger version of Number 96 again from
[SPEAKER_00]: about 1905, 19, about 110 years old here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then right next to it, we have one
from 1870.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is particularly interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a label here on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't in real good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Cannabis Indica USP.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of it here, it says,
not poisonous according to the best
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities, though formerly regarded so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an anti-spasmodic, analgesic,
anesthetic, and narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an aphrodisiac, specifically
recommended in spasmodic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insanity, peculiar to women.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, menstrual problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diagnosed by mental worry or moral shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a woman on PMS and you have
mental worry or moral shock, this company
[SPEAKER_00]: thought this was the thing for women.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and says, in the best known
hypnotic and delirium tremens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're an alcoholic,
this would help you get off the booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its anodyne power is marked in chronic
mitriitis and dysmenorrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dysmenorrhea again is menstrual pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used with excellent results in habituates
of opium, chloroform, and cocaine use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also recommended it to get off
opium, chloroform, and cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In hysterical cases, as claimed by
chloroform or opium, it's acting
[SPEAKER_00]: especially well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what Eli Lilly said in
approximately 1870.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right next door we have this cough
and cold balsam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is alcohol, chloroform,
and antimony tart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has a bottle inside and this
nifty little thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe we can close in on that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it has this insert that is actually
printed in 13 different languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read it in 13 languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case you're newly immigrated here this
week, this was a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from 1885.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was produced in Pennsylvania,
Plymouth, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it we have our regular hemp
flame of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hemp seed oil with a hemp wick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is next week's wick right here folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some raw hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is after we've had the hemp wick
in there and burning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a little shot glass with some
hemp seed oil in it and we light it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the reason that marijuana is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a coincidence, I believe,
that an Israeli Canadian energy company
[SPEAKER_00]: called Adir Energy, again you can look
them up, adirainergy.com, this Israeli
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian oil company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking for years that the only
reason that marijuana is illegal isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really about drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about money and power and the
continued centralization of economic and
[SPEAKER_00]: political control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's specifically about energy and
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the reasons marijuana is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want us to have this naturally
decentralized resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want us to have to buy it from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound familiar to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, here's our hemp ball of twine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is hemp crete.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's limestone powdered down called
quicklime and it's broken up and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger than concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a little hemp stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like hemp stocks around here,
don't we, Eric?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's the end of our show
and tell for tonight.
