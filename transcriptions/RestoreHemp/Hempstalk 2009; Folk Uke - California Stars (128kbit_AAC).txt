[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to rest a heavy head tonight on a
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: California stars, I'd like to lay my weary
bones tonight on a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: California stars, I'd love to feel your
hand touching mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, tell me why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must keep working on you so I give my
life to lay my head tonight on a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: California stars, I'd love to dream of
troubles all the way on a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: California stars, jump up from my star bed
and make another day underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: California stars, they hang like grapes on
vines that shine and warm a lover's glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like friendly wine as we give this world a
dream a dream a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: With you on our bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand touching mine, tell me why.
[SPEAKER_00]: North stars, I'd love to dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: jump up from my star bed, make another day
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Form a lover's glass, like a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give this world a dream a dream with you
on our bed.
California stars, I'd love to dream of
troubles all the way on a bed.
