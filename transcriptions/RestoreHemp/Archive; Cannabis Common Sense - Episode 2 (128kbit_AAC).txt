[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to Cannabis Common
Sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a program that's about the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act, an initiative petition
[SPEAKER_00]: to tax and regulate the sales of marijuana
here in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act is an
initiative petition sponsored by our
[SPEAKER_00]: political committee, Campaign for the
Restoration and Regulation of Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Paul Stanford and I'm one of the three
chief petitioners and I'd like to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: several of the aspects of the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our initiative will tax and regulate the
sales of marijuana through Oregon's 280
[SPEAKER_00]: state liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, through the state liquor stores,
the age limit is strictly enforced,
[SPEAKER_00]: so only people over the age of 21 will be
purchasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will allow
doctors to prescribe marijuana to patients
[SPEAKER_00]: through pharmacies so that people who need
marijuana when they're sick or ill for
[SPEAKER_00]: various ailments, everything from glaucoma
and to combat the AIDS wasting syndrome to
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting the effects of chemotherapy in
relation to its use to stop cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana helps in all of those cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also allow farmers here in Oregon
to grow hemp for fiber, protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: and oil and make everything from textiles
and rope to paper and from food to energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act, by legalizing industrial hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: will create thousands of sustainable jobs
right here in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you to help us with the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our petition and it will,
as I said, tax and regulate the sales of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and we urge you to call our
office at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: And help us put this issue on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our petition's currently in
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have until July of 1998 to gather
enough signatures to put this issue on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your help, so give us a call at
235-4606 and help put the Oregon Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Tax Act on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will raise
hundreds and millions of dollars in state
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of that money will go into the state
general fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: To lower the tax burden on us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 10% is split among 8% for drug
abuse treatment programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that people who have substance abuse
problems with alcohol or other drugs can
[SPEAKER_00]: get the help they need when they need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently about 90% of those people are
turned away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will increase
funding for people looking for help with
[SPEAKER_00]: substance abuse problems by a factor of at
least 10 and perhaps as much as 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% of the proceeds from the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act will go to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: educational program for kids in grade
schools and secondary schools so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can find out the real dangers that
substance abuse might pose to their
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final 1% would go into creating a
state agriculture committee that would
[SPEAKER_00]: promote Oregon hemp fiber, protein,
and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That committee would be funded by the
proceeds from the sales of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, marijuana is useful as a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the oldest medical text,
the Ankara Veda from North Central India,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago listed
marijuana as one of the primary medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today a lot of research has been done
around the world that proves that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and various constituents in marijuana are
useful in treating various medical
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those agents in cannabis is
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THC has been synthesized and isolated
in a capsule form called merinol,
[SPEAKER_00]: or technically drabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product is useful in turn,
and it's the main psychoactive product in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's useful in stimulating appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the only active substance in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also CBD, or cannabinodial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabinodial is useful for treating
spasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an anti-spastic agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's completely separate use from
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why marijuana in its vegetable form
is useful for MS patients, patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple sclerosis, because it helps stop
their spasms and helps them control that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another pharmaceutically
active substance in cannabis that isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cannabichromine, or CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabichromine is an anti-inflammatory
agent, which is why cannabis in its raw
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable form is useful for arthritis and
any other inflammation of the joints or
[SPEAKER_00]: problems along that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is a very useful medicine with
several different medicinal compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pill form, THC, or merinol,
is not completely an effective medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for everything that cannabis can treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will allow
doctors to prescribe cannabis through
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be at cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cost of medical cannabis will be
just a few pennies on the dollar compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis sold in the state liquor
store system to adults over the age of 21
[SPEAKER_00]: will be taxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that money, the revenue from that tax,
will go to the state general fund to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with drug education and drug treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the medical cannabis won't be taxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, adults or any sick person would
be allowed to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, the THC pills, which once again
only have one active agent from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: those THC pills are $6 each for a person
who has AIDS or multiple sclerosis that
[SPEAKER_00]: has to take them regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $30,000 a year in just medicine
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if that cannabis was grown
commercially without the black market in
[SPEAKER_00]: place the way it has inflated the prices
today, the amount of money that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: needed for that person's medicine for an
entire year would be about $50 compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the $30,000 just using THC Marinol pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for the people who are
undergoing chemotherapy, they have violent
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea for over a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the people who have the AIDS wasting
syndrome or have multiple sclerosis and
[SPEAKER_00]: can't keep down those $6 pills,
sometimes they'll take one pill and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll throw it up two or three times
before they can keep it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it takes up to an hour and a
half to go into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take this pill, they throw it up a
couple times, finally they keep one down
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it goes into effect about an hour
and a half later and that's at $6 a pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a nickel's worth of cannabis,
one or two deep inhalations and it acts
[SPEAKER_00]: instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war on drugs is not about drugs at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war on drugs is about money and the
continued centralization of economic and
[SPEAKER_00]: political control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war on drugs continues to centralize
economic control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see huge amounts of money just in the
Marinol industry going to pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of going out to farmers and out to
decentralized sources to spread the wealth
[SPEAKER_00]: to us all, the pharmaceutical company has
a huge interest in keeping this Marinol
[SPEAKER_00]: and the synthetic pharmaceutical product
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see at $30,000 a year,
let's say there are a thousand people here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Portland area alone, and that's
probably an underestimate, that need to
[SPEAKER_00]: take that and so that right there is $30
million a year just from that one market
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply that by the rest of the United
States and you can see why the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry is against the
sales of marijuana as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't make the money off of it that
they can off these synthetic drugs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic drugs have side effects that the
organic ones don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana has never in human history ever
caused a lethal overdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the effects of alcohol,
we see the effects of Valium, we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of many other pharmaceutical drugs
and how many thousands of people die each
[SPEAKER_00]: year here in the United States from the
use of pharmaceutical drugs where
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana has not caused a single lethal
overdose in recorded history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana in fact is one of the safest
drugs known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an article from the Lancet which
is one of Britain's oldest medical
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lancet has been published for over 400
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the oldest English language medical
text and in their editorial from last
[SPEAKER_00]: November of 1995, just a little over a
year ago, they said in their editorial
[SPEAKER_00]: de-glamorizing cannabis that the use of
cannabis, the smoking of cannabis even
[SPEAKER_00]: long term is not harmful to health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know many people tell us that
marijuana is a dangerous drug but here we
[SPEAKER_00]: have the oldest peer-reviewed medical
journal in the world saying that the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking of cannabis even long term is not
harmful to health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do these doctors say this when the
industries and people who control our
[SPEAKER_00]: economic and political systems here in the
United States tell us differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an economic incentive to do so
and we want to stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to put economic control back where
it belongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that the government has abdicated
its responsibility to control this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government has a responsibility to
control the sales of marijuana and we
[SPEAKER_00]: think the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will force the government to take
control back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently they've abdicated control to the
black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in the black market who are
controlling it outside of a few small
[SPEAKER_00]: number of people at the top who are making
the most money, people who control it by
[SPEAKER_00]: and large are children and substance
abusers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to take control out of the hands
of kids and substance abusers and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the liquor stores so the
government can control the sales and make
[SPEAKER_00]: certain that it's only going to those over
the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know currently by putting children and
substance abusers in control of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: we put these drugs in the hands of kids
who are selling them in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look back at alcohol prohibition we
see that during alcohol prohibition kids
[SPEAKER_00]: were selling gin, whiskey, rum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling these various products
in the schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact back during alcohol prohibition
from 1917 to 1933 entire schools closed
[SPEAKER_00]: down for a day because everybody in the
school was drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that doesn't happen today but we do
see the effects of weapons and fighting
[SPEAKER_00]: over control of the markets for these
illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that marijuana in the black
market is dangerous for our youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact you know we think that marijuana
is not a gateway drug that in fact it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: gateway to the black market and this
article in the British Medical Journal
[SPEAKER_00]: from December of 1995 just a year ago
shows how that in fact is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their article called The War on Drugs
Prohibition Isn't Working Some
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization Will Help they said that the
use of marijuana by minors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands is roughly less than a fifth
what it is here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that's amazing about that is
that in the Netherlands they allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: sales of marijuana to anyone over the age
of 16 through the Netherlands coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the United States marijuana is
completely prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Netherlands since 1976 they've
allowed the sales of marijuana to anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: over the age of 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the use of marijuana by those between
the ages of 17 and 18 is less than one
[SPEAKER_00]: fifth less than 20 percent what it is here
in the United States where it's completely
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana isn't the gateway drug but
marijuana prohibition is the gateway to
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe by taking marijuana out of the
black market and letting the government
[SPEAKER_00]: control its sales that the use of
marijuana will decline and the use of all
[SPEAKER_00]: other drugs will decline as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This same British Medical Journal article
says that the use of hard drugs such as
[SPEAKER_00]: cocaine and heroin by minors in the
Netherlands is less than one tenth what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is here in the United States less than 10
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly what the Dutch are doing is
working and we want Oregon to emulate that
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know just in the last few months in
this country this November the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California passed Proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition 215 has allowed patients in
California to use marijuana to combat
[SPEAKER_00]: various illnesses including glaucoma for
which it lowers the interocular pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: thereby saving people's eyesight.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the wasting syndrome associated with
AIDS or cancer chemotherapy in fact a
[SPEAKER_00]: study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology
a cancer publication they surveyed all
[SPEAKER_00]: oncologists cancer doctors here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found that 42 percent of all
oncologists had recommended marijuana to
[SPEAKER_00]: their patients even though it's illegal
and 48 percent of those physicians said
[SPEAKER_00]: that they would recommend marijuana if in
fact it was medicinally available and 56
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of them said that they thought
marijuana was useful medication to combat
[SPEAKER_00]: the side effects from chemotherapy to
treat AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know currently here in the United
States we have a system where medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are arrested for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should ask ourselves this question who
should decide what medicine is best for a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be the patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be the doctors who are deciding
what medicine is good for patients or
[SPEAKER_00]: should it be law enforcement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we put law enforcement in charge of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact in an article from the San
Francisco Journal just last week as we
[SPEAKER_00]: tape this show in January perhaps a little
bit later as it's being shown just they
[SPEAKER_00]: just reopened the cannabis buyer club in
San Francisco because of Proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the Attorney General in the state
of California Dan Lundgren went in with
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of officers and closed down the
cannabis buyer's club last September.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did that to send a political message to
try to stop the passage of Proposition
[SPEAKER_00]: 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well recently a court judge issued an
injunction to stop the closure of the
[SPEAKER_00]: buyer's club and the buyer's club is
reopened and now they are legally with the
[SPEAKER_00]: court's blessing selling cannabis to
patients who have a medical need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know here in Oregon there are some
brave people who are operating a buyer's
[SPEAKER_00]: club to help patients that have a doctor's
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that that shouldn't be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact there's a legislature legislator
here in Portland in the state legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: as our Oregon legislative session starts
George Amy and his last name is spelled
[SPEAKER_00]: E-I-G-H-M-E-Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Amy is introducing a medical bill
so the legislature might enact a medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis provision so that patients can
receive the cannabis they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact back in California when they
passed Prop 215 one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced them was Doonesbury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary Trudeau in his Doonesbury comic strip
began to lambast the Attorney General Dan
[SPEAKER_00]: Lundgren and Dan Lundgren actually
responded and asked that somehow the
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper be made to stop putting out
Doonesbury's cartoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know Bill Clinton is lambasted as are
many politicians by Doonesbury and various
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of them ever pay attention and
say to stop but Dan Lundgren actually said
[SPEAKER_00]: that they should stop printing the
Doonesbury cartoon and one of his
[SPEAKER_00]: spokesperson even went so far as to say
that they think they should arrest the
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoon characters in Doonesbury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that just shows the extent to which
the drug warriors will go to fight this
[SPEAKER_00]: war because to them it's not an issue
about drugs it's an issue about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The officers who are benefiting from this
make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seize a lot of objects that the
government sells and brings more money to
[SPEAKER_00]: the government's coffers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Portland when they arrest someone
they'll often only prosecute people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have equity in their home and they will
seize that equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they can based on just a few small
plants in a person's home they can come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and seize their equity in their life
savings and the people count themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky if they're not put in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know a good percentage of these people
are doing this for medical need and we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to allow these people to have access
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our initiative the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act
will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your help in getting signatures on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge you to give us a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get our petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us mail them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow get hold of these petitions and
get signatures for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very least get your own signature
and send it back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your friend's signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a call to do that at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not your standard office hours we
have voicemail hooked up to that that can
[SPEAKER_00]: take many messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you to give us a call and ask us
to send you our petitions today to
[SPEAKER_00]: 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: The decriminalization and regulation
taxation of marijuana has been receiving a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of publicity lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance here is the cover of Time
Magazine where they're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: increased use and increased awareness of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact they have a Doonesbury cartoon on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the Attorney General of
California Dan Lundgren doesn't like that
[SPEAKER_00]: too much but you can see that it is
getting more and more publicity and so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're here to try to urge you to help the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can call us and get our petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be happy to send them to you or you
could come down to one of our booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have booths at the Saturday Market,
the Lloyd Center on occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact we could use your help to staff
our booths or to staff our office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give us a call and get hooked in and
help us put this important issue on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another magazine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Nation, a progressive magazine with a
long history here in the United States and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that they say the war is over
and drugs win.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug war is a colossal failure of
unprecedented proportions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fought for an incredibly long
time at the cost of billions and billions
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars and it's a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to stop that failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to lower the costs associated with
enforcing these crazy laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we've been tracking convictions
and incarcerations here in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been tracking them over about a period of
a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that a little bit more than 55%
of all convictions and incarcerations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the penitentiary here in the state of
Oregon are for drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 55% of those and half of those are a
little bit more than 25% are just for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The costs associated with this are
enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs tens of thousands of dollars to
incarcerate these people every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars
to arrest them, take them through the
[SPEAKER_00]: court process and prosecute them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have to spend millions and even
billions of dollars to build new prisons
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we're doing here in the state of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we're going to increase our
prison population according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper, the Oregonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the next 10 years from an article on
March 30th of 1996 the prison population
[SPEAKER_00]: will increase by a factor of 158% in the
next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we already have more people in
prison per capita than any other country
[SPEAKER_00]: in the history of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more people in prison than South
Africa had under apartheid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more people in prison than the
Soviet Union had under communism.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it isn't done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate of incarceration continues to
increase at an ever quickening pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you to write your representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have their addresses right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you to write to your
representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write to your local newspapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every one of you that writes we know
there are a hundred of you that wish you
[SPEAKER_00]: could write and wish you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you to take up your pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most powerful weapon of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you to pick up your pen and write
to your legislator and to write into us
[SPEAKER_00]: and help us change these terrible laws and
the impact they're having on our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that through the Oregon Cannabis
Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act once again
will tax and regulate the sales of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana to adults in Oregon state liquor
stores where the age limit of 21 is
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly enforced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will raise hundreds and millions of
dollars in revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to all the government savings
there will be hundreds and millions of new
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars pouring in to our state general
fund and that's going to lower the tax
[SPEAKER_00]: burden on us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will fund drug treatment programs so
that the alcoholics and addicts can get
[SPEAKER_00]: the help they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will fund drug education programs to
warn kids about the real dangers that
[SPEAKER_00]: substance abuse might pose to their
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will fund a state agriculture committee
that will promote Oregon hemp fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: protein and oil creating thousands of
ecologically sustainable jobs and helping
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Oregon be on the cutting edge
of environmentally sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will allow Oregon doctors to prescribe
cannabis through pharmacies at cost so
[SPEAKER_00]: that sick people can get the cannabis they
need to help their health and help them
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will allow farmers to have a valuable
new crop that will help save small family
[SPEAKER_00]: farms and help the rural economies
throughout the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take what is indisputably the
largest cash crop in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It perhaps is the largest industry,
even in the black market today with it
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal, the largest industry in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you can find out more about the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act by looking at our
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our website address is here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's www.crrac.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's CRRH, that's the name of our

[SPEAKER_00]: Restoration and Regulation of Hemp.

our address, octa at CRRH.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I urge you in fact to not wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: To pick up the phone right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give us a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us send you these petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your help you know we can put this
important issue on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to stop the massive
deforestation that's happening across our
[SPEAKER_00]: planet and create sustainable economic
opportunities by allowing farmers to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp for paper use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to stop the excessive dependence
on cotton, which is the most pollution
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't know that 30% of all the
pesticides in the world are created to go
[SPEAKER_00]: on the cotton crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp can grow without any pesticides and
produces many times more biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a call right now at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 235-4606.

to sign it and get it back to us as soon

and watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We urge you once again to give our
campaign a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us tax and regulate the sales of
marijuana and educate people about the
[SPEAKER_00]: real benefits that can be had by
institutions including industrial hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical hemp and how we can turn our
economy around and create environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable jobs by putting Oregon on the
cutting edge of that development.

Have a great night.
