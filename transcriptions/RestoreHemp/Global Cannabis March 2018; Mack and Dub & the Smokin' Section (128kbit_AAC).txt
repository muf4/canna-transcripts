[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, Rose City.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I go called and asked if I would
speak today, I was like, sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 15 years ago, y'all, I was locked up
at the justice center looking outside at
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland from a jail cell for being
arrested for two months over less than
[SPEAKER_00]: half a gram of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able to be standing right here at
Pioneer Square 15 years after that
[SPEAKER_00]: incident, and being able to voice my
opinion on the benefits of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to weed my mother, who's a
diabetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a stroke a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the marijuana has been helping her way
better than the medication has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's been a big skeptic about it for
years, like a lot of our elders are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these pharmaceutical companies is
killing their pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing the pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they want legalized cannabis for
the people that really need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool to have it for recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool to have it for recreational
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's people and kids that are
benefiting from the CBDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do it to get recreationally
high, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Madeline always encourages us at every
rally to make sure we get out and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a say so in the direction of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of Madeline Martinez,
her movement is what led to the music that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're about to provide for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give this lady, this queen of Potlin,
a big round of applause for her
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her leadership and her fight for all of
us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How y'all doing, Potlin?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Potlin, come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all, everybody come to the front of the
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all can come a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some CDs to give out, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of your hometown boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mack and Dub in the smokin' section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help end marijuana prohibition.

seven years right now.

Global Cannabis March.

food, and I smoke every night before the

[SPEAKER_01]: And it leaves two punks before I put on my
shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put butt butter on my purple hay
pancakes.
