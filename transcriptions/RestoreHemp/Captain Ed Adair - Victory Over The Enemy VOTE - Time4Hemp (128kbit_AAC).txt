[SPEAKER_00]: My other organization is vote Victory over
the enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I like that which is the unregistered
voter in the state of California Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we have to do is upgrade our standard
of voting We can send people to the moon
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're sending satellites in and out of
space I believe that our system of voting
[SPEAKER_00]: in this country is very Adequated very old
it needs to be renewed and revised and
[SPEAKER_00]: updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the voting should be more
important than Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think that we should spend a lot of
money on education The people look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: this way the government is in favor of the
United States public to vote I Feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's our duty to show them or to find a
way to help the government find ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: help people vote and I think with
television a telephone computer optics and
[SPEAKER_00]: and satellite dishes and all this
technology that we've got we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to sit home and vote on all these
important issues and I'm sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: Government wants everybody to vote It's
it's our constitutional right and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: and they stand behind it I think that they
should get behind us and help us to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and make voting a very important
issue It is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you are not in favor of say the
California marijuana initiative of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp initiative That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love for you to come out and
speak your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you out there voting We want you
to take an active part in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do then I think this will solve the
problem
