[SPEAKER_00]: In 1974, I started writing a book about
growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had pot plants in the backyard and the
problem was that that first batch of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I grew was too strong and I had to
give it all away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't used to a weed that was that
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was seeds from Vietnam that a Vietnam
vet had brought back and given to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had four seeds and they all grew and
they were all females and they were these
[SPEAKER_00]: little cute little bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it was just crazy strong so I had to
give it all away and start over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: season and by then I had collected a lot
of different strains and decided to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger garden with with 11 different
strains and I so carefully labeled all
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is all from seed so you you
didn't really know what exactly you were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get but people would say oh yeah
somebody brought these back from Nepal and
[SPEAKER_00]: these were from Guerrero Mexico and you
know these ones were from Colombia and so
[SPEAKER_00]: label it grow it see what it does that was
my whole program that year meanwhile the
[SPEAKER_00]: phone's starting to ring and the phone and
people are saying to me how did you what
[SPEAKER_00]: did you put in the ground you know how did
you do that when does it show a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: what does the flower look like you know
how big should the leaves be should I be
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning anything I'm going oh my god and
about a couple of months of that and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: hoarse I couldn't talk from just and not
only that but this is the funny truth is
[SPEAKER_00]: that people would call me back again the
next day and ask me exactly the same
[SPEAKER_00]: questions because they forgot the answers
the day before so we know something was
[SPEAKER_00]: working anyway I decided I better write it
down to save myself so girlfriend and I
[SPEAKER_00]: Goldie my girlfriend Goldie and I started
taking serious notes and doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: photography and taking pictures of these
things and and recording and I had already
[SPEAKER_00]: been very careful about how I how I did
the garden so that it wouldn't get mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: up in there and then I was also careful
about not allowing the male plants to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to seed because I by now heard of sense
Amia but I wanted some seeds from I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a little crossing so I did very
careful manual with a paintbrush crossings
[SPEAKER_00]: of a couple of different kinds but but you
know the male pollen was hard to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you let that male plant I would
cut them right down so they had one little
[SPEAKER_00]: branch you know so and so I wrote all this
stuff down we kept track and kept records
[SPEAKER_00]: and within I would say within two years we
knew what we were doing so and I had by
[SPEAKER_00]: this time gotten turned on to organic
gardening because I I came across a
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine about organic gardening and read
it it made so much sense to me that I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that this was the way to go I had to go
this way because it's there was the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose was then twofold once one was to
teach people how to grow really good good
[SPEAKER_00]: pot at home and the other one was to teach
people organic gardening which I saw as
[SPEAKER_00]: the vision of the future and nobody even
really heard of it then so I dedicated my
[SPEAKER_00]: book to the memory of Jerome Irving Rodale
who was the guy who started organic
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening magazine in this country and
then I started researching back and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding out about these English English
gardeners Sir Albert Howard for instance
[SPEAKER_00]: who was also Prince Charles illuminated
mentor and that this this actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic gardening had a had a deep history
in France as well so suddenly I was
[SPEAKER_00]: educated and I decided to put as much of
that education into that book as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time and and yet make it simple
enough so that anybody could do it and
[SPEAKER_00]: here you know here's how and how to
recognize a male flower from a female
[SPEAKER_00]: flower which nobody had never seen a
flower you know pot came in a bag all
[SPEAKER_00]: mashed together by a hydraulic press in
those days anyway so suddenly we had
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful weed I'm gorgeous and smelly and
it was like oh my gosh you know so the fun
[SPEAKER_00]: started and I published that book it was a
bestseller and I sold 50,000 copies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two years and you know and then the
work was done you know I had boom people
[SPEAKER_00]: knew how and suddenly there was just weed
everywhere and it was good so since the
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s you know the research and development
for cannabis got really stunted by
[SPEAKER_00]: government repression but that wasn't true
in other places so there was actually some
[SPEAKER_00]: research going on in France and Israel and
you know places where intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity trumps repression and you know
people began to find out a lot more about
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant but it's only recently that
we've that we've come to discover that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has so many other vital roles for you know
just juicing the leaves the big green
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and putting them in your morning
juice apparently this is fabulous for you
[SPEAKER_00]: the various strains of pot that they've
been able to develop that have either THC
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabidiol in them how much of each
you know and I just feel like the
[SPEAKER_00]: repression part sort of forced a lot of
this both the increase in potency because
[SPEAKER_00]: the reduction in size and then the and
then the the intense manicuring which I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally don't have any use for I like
leaves myself but just to see how how
[SPEAKER_00]: compressed the product got and how
important it was to people and how now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's become like the wine or the wine or
brandy industry you know it's this
[SPEAKER_00]: intensely focused thing I think it's
really interesting I think there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of very hip very smart thoughtful people I
have gotten into the into the production
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and so the quality has just
gone up and up and up and now it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: sideways because we now understand what
the chemistry is of this plant and it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: that by going sideways it makes a much
broader spectrum of cultivars and these
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars which is strains of pot they're
they're really interesting and we're now
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing these stories about how people
have found cures for long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: neurological problems and you know it
takes the edge off of Parkinson's and is
[SPEAKER_00]: like wow look at all this and this was
purely anecdotal 25 years ago you you
