[SPEAKER_00]: So, when I was running for office,
I was asked what my position was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I said was that if every elected
official who ever smoked marijuana voted
[SPEAKER_00]: to legalize it, it would be legal in an
instant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition has not worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fueled criminal violence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now in this city, right now in this
city, I know this, I know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now in this city, we have seen
murders because people are murdering each
[SPEAKER_00]: other over pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen home invasion robberies
because it's a black market site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a member of my staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people, he brews his own
beer in his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have to worry about somebody
breaking into his house to steal his beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have to worry that when he
gives it to a friend, he's subjecting
[SPEAKER_00]: himself to arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rules we have right now on
marijuana, they put too many young people
[SPEAKER_00]: at risk, not just of arrest, not just of
incarceration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, which falls much more
heavily, much more heavily on our
[SPEAKER_00]: communities of color than it does on
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also fuels criminal violence and it
makes us all less safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to tax it, regulate it,
legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote yes on I-502.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's have a same pot policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana policy for this state of
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks you to Hemfest for 20 years of
organizing to change attitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this fall, you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Come on, Mike.
Come on, Mike.
Come on, Mike.
