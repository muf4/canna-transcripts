[SPEAKER_00]: What does it do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it affect you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much taxes will they get if they
include you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes it's just the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Oregon, if they decide that they don't
want to participate, they don't get any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of looking forward to see how
well that plays out for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, Portland is going to
become uber uber rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cities like Sandy, right next door,
who boldly spoke up to my friend and told
[SPEAKER_00]: him no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not open a dispensary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: How come I can't open a dispensary here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, because we don't like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that acceptable?
[SPEAKER_00]: If your city or your county tells you we
don't want you here and we don't like you
[SPEAKER_00]: here, you need to stand up and tell them
I'm here and you're going to like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to accept that I use cannabis
and I'm going to vote you out if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: because your vote counts and your money
counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please share love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please put money in the bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This festival is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak up.
Thank you.
