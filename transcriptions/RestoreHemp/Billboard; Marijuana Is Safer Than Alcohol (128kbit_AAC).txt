[SPEAKER_01]: Alcohol Awareness Month is an opportune
time to be talking about the relative
[SPEAKER_01]: harms of alcohol and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This billboard isn't simply saying,
go ahead and choose one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's saying, don't just drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about what you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're enjoying a glass of beer,
if you're enjoying a glass of wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: a great Oregon IPA, if you're enjoying a
great Oregon Pinot Noir, think about how
[SPEAKER_01]: adults who choose to use marijuana for
many of the same reasons, to relax,
[SPEAKER_01]: to socialize, with friends, to enjoy
themselves, to be responsible but to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume responsibly in that manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about what message we're sending to
those adults and what message we're
[SPEAKER_01]: sending to future generations when we tell
people we're going to punish them for
[SPEAKER_01]: making a choice that is safer than alcohol
and we are going to encourage them to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume a substance that's more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are in a situation where you can
choose to consume alcohol or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to consume marijuana, society will
tell you it's better than that you choose
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, even if it's bad for you,
even if it makes you violent, even if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're breaking the law in some cases
under age drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we as a society have been encouraging
people to consume alcohol and what we are
[SPEAKER_01]: saying in Oregon is we're not jeopardizing
and we're not threatening the stability of
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon's beer and wine industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a combined three billion dollar a
year industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're saying is for adults who choose
to consume marijuana because it's safer
[SPEAKER_01]: for them and because they prefer marijuana
over alcohol, they shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: criminalized, they shouldn't be
ostracized, they shouldn't be stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be treating them with respect
and we should be letting them make that
[SPEAKER_01]: safer choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're saying is we have established a
way to regulate alcohol in this economy
[SPEAKER_01]: and we celebrate alcohol as a society.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to do that knowing the
harms that alcohol presents, let's at
[SPEAKER_01]: least not punish people who want to make a
safer choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you worried that the billboard might
discourage people from going over to your
[SPEAKER_00]: festival and drinking some beer or wine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in the least.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to those people coming
over and we're looking forward to this
[SPEAKER_02]: moving forward and hopefully it will get
legalized at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings in a lot of tourist dollars and
we are a tourist industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we put on this festival, we get
people from all around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to see more people show up and
enjoy our fine products and if this is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be one of them, all the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think marijuana is safer than beer
and wine?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is safer than beer and wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you so certain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been using it for 44 years so I
have at least a little bit of background
[SPEAKER_02]: on it and I feel it's extremely safe for
people and it's actually not just safe,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a medical marijuana card?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish this would progress sooner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that Washington and Colorado have
taken the lead on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon should be right there with it and
if we could move it along quicker,
[SPEAKER_02]: next year Easter is on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about moms and dads who are watching
who might have teenagers at home who are
[SPEAKER_02]: impressionable and think this sends the
wrong message to them?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a discussion they'll have to have
with their kids.
