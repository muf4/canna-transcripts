[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that in Washington,
I might be surprised for you folks to know
[SPEAKER_00]: we do not have legalized industrial hemp
cultivation or legalized marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've not yet passed industrial hemp
legislation in Washington and we do have
[SPEAKER_00]: an argument as to whether or not it should
already be legal based upon our state
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of marijuana, which has the
qualifier of having more than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an interesting thing we have
going on in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a federal level, so jealous of Oregon
because your federal senators,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyden and Merkley have primed and
co-sponsored the Industrial Hemp Farming
[SPEAKER_00]: Act of 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was refiled after 2013, but that's a
very small and simple act that would
[SPEAKER_00]: remove industrial hemp from the Controlled
Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: All five of your federal representatives
have co-sponsored the sister bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is H.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: 525 in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Oregon should be very, very proud of
itself on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mention just that there are so
many industries that industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: affects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we know about the nutrition,
but even just from the seed, we would get
[SPEAKER_00]: into cosmeceutical, nutraceutical and
industrial oil and all of the derivatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: protein powders, and even the byproducts
of the seed industry, which are hulls,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be used for any number of
applications, including fillers for
[SPEAKER_00]: biocomposites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also talking about apparel,
textiles, paper, that industry alone to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to use hemp blends in our paper and
our recycled fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're even moving into,
of course, building materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: nanotechnology, supercapacitors,
biomass used for biomedical purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we never saw coming 25 years
ago when I first became interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have a future here of planet
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we can legalize the both species
of cannabis, we'll be able then I think to
[SPEAKER_00]: move on to expand the way we deal with
agriculture and the healing of the land
[SPEAKER_00]: and the water and the biosphere and start
to marry more permaculture techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: move beyond this sustainable concept and
move into regenerative concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And industrial hemp and permaculture
techniques can bring the planet into this
[SPEAKER_00]: healing that will be required for us to be
able to deliver the next seven generations
[SPEAKER_00]: into a healthy world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing something right on a state
and federal level.
