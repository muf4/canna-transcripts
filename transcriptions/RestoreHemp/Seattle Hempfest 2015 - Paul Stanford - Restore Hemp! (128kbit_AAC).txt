[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that hemp, cannabis,
marijuana, is the most important plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we are able to restore hemp
without regard to its THC content,
[SPEAKER_00]: but according to the varieties that make
the best seed for fuel and fiber and food,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best stems and stalks for paper,
building materials, canvas, rope,
[SPEAKER_00]: lace and linen, and the best buds for
medicine, when we grow that all as one
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, we will replace petroleum and change
the whole economic and environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to happen, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to replace petroleum with hemp
seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to a study of wild hemp here in
the United States back in 1975,
[SPEAKER_00]: done at University of Illinois at Urbana,
published in the American Midlands
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturalist from Notre Dame, one acre of
hemp will make over 8,000 pounds of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's about 15 times more than the
low THC varieties that they allow to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated in Canada and that they're
starting to allow here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we remove those bullshit
restrictions and allow farmers to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp for fuel without regard to its THC
content, instead of poisoning the earth
[SPEAKER_00]: with petrochemicals, we'll be reviving the
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of taking energy out of the
natural cycle, we'll be putting energy
[SPEAKER_00]: back in and we'll be creating food as a
byproduct and fiber as a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't have to deforestate this
planet anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cotton alone takes about 50% of
all the world's pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp doesn't take any.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I urge you to go to hemp.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out a little bit more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of the things I do is I've
been blessed to be able to help medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a really bad law passed this year for
medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was signed into law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Senate Bill 5052.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to lobby the legislature and stop
that from being fully implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already started to be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have doctors that help patients get
their medical marijuana permits at THCF
[SPEAKER_00]: medical clinics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are not going to completely comply
with those laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're challenging the law and we're
continuing to help patients all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past 10 years, we've been able to
get over 100,000 Washington residents
[SPEAKER_00]: become legal medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can possess, use, and grow
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, patients need to be able to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every person should be able to grow
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an initiative out there right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative 739.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it at our tables at the THCF
medical clinic down by the main stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another booth up by Sealy stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get signatures to put that on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we urge you to go out there and sign
these petitions because that's the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: change this, is we have to stand up and
remain politically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this thing can continue to
provide jobs for people but change the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole energy paradigm and the economic
paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can replace petroleum, instead of
having our money go to Exxon and Mobile
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Saudi Sheiks and Nigerian despots,
it'll go to our farmers and our farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: will spend it in our own communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the whole reason marijuana was
criminalized was to stop its use as a
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: transnational, corporate, elite,
fascist, sons of bitches who invented the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only if we continue to stand up
and tell the truth to power that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: restore hemp and save our environment and
put food on our table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I urge you to go up there, sign the
petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all should be able to grow this until
marijuana is cheap and plentiful and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can use hemp for energy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In closing, I just want to say,
you know, this stage has been dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter McWilliams for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great actor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another fellow, Kevin Black,
who has been a HempFest security volunteer
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that have passed
carrying this torch to end marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge you to go out there and do your
duty and carry it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank the Seattle HempFest and restore
hemp!
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
