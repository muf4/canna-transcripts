[SPEAKER_00]: This is the song, this next song,
I've had the privilege of playing this in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of millions of people now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks have called it the Hemp
National Anthem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it Let's All Be Farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we were all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why Jack gave his life for
everything that he's done, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I love you, Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're up there playing with Captain
Net and having a great time sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: your 63 VW bus and smoking a fatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's all be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get filthy rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, we're wrecking the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it's beginning to bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's all be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to save the trees, I can grow my own
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without the pain, please, oh,
let's all be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pain must stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the new, the old, the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, billion dollar crop, oh, let's all be
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to save the seas, I can grow my own
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without the pain, please, oh,
let's all be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that sun's ray, oh, I can grow my
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, without the pain, let's all be
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, now that you know, well, who am I to
tell you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I used to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and as we watch that last tree fall,
oh, well, what could I be without them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I could have had them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all be farmers.
Let's all be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all be farmers.
Let's all be farmers.
