[SPEAKER_00]: You know we should believe less and think
more, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, if you don't, think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, believe, when we say I believe,
I'm not trying to start any shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when we say I believe, actually we're
really saying I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not gonna go out and say I don't
know this, I don't know that, so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go and say I believe this,
I believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we need to really think about
thinking rather than believing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is energy, energy flows,
that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking is energy, it flows, but believe
is a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take the flowing energy of
thinking and put it in the container of
[SPEAKER_00]: believing, it's got nowhere to go,
so it just kind of intensifies inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: container and creates all the stress and
freak out shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think more, believe less.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's the... I don't know
where it came from, but hey, it's out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you got it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the rhyme of match, these embers of
torch, sweetening the light, what you do
[SPEAKER_00]: to me, this temptation of heat,
craving your liquid, that deep fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: in sweet rushing flame, an embracing of
stirring, your name is the spark,
[SPEAKER_00]: fire starting this roar, blazing through
my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much is said about love, but love seems
too tame, but love is too tame,
[SPEAKER_00]: with no way to explain, our wilding of
gentle,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the reality of dream, the closeness of
close, melting destiny and fate,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is meant to be an unraveling of need,
this drenching of desire, and it all
[SPEAKER_00]: started with your smile,
[SPEAKER_00]: an embracing of stirring, your name is the
spark, fire starting this roar,
[SPEAKER_01]: blazing through my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much is said about love, but love seems
too tame, no way to explain,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rhyme of match, these embers of
torch, sweetening the light, what you do
[SPEAKER_00]: to me, this temptation of heat,
craving your liquid, that deep fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: in sweet rushing flame.
Thank you.
