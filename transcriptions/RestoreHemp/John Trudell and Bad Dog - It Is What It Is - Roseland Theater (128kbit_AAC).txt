[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no use in wishing, hoping, and wanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, if only, and those coulda,
shoulda, and woulda's are just troubles
[SPEAKER_00]: for the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crying around about most anything is
just a waste of tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life doesn't put anything in front of us
that we can't handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in the handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coherent or incoherent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clarity or chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that ever happens is there to
make us stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we understand, our strength gets
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we don't understand, our
weaknesses get stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inevitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when falling down, falls down.
[SPEAKER_00]: How down can falling down fall?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when getting back up gets back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How up can getting back up get back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the reality of being, reality waits for
human recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: To recognize the power of intelligence
clearly used is a way of seeing,
[SPEAKER_00]: curing, healing spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about whether we can or can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about whether we will or we won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blamers and the blamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play a dangerous game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning responsibility into another one of
their casualties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desperating.
[SPEAKER_00]: While hidden behind the light cast by our
shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life holds its breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wants us to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gift we were given.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a decision we make.
It is what it is.
