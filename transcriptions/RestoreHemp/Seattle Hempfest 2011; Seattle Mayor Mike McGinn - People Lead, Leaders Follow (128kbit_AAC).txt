[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking in my official capacity as mayor,
I have a message to all of you out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Seattle!
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: During my campaign, somebody asked me what
my position was on marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I said was that if every politician
and elected official who had ever tried
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana voted to legalize it,
it would be legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the truth, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been, as a society, very
hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Steves has spoken about this,
and your prior speakers have spoken about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we live in a very complicated world
right now where attitudes are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it harder on lots of folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it harder on people that want
safe access to drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it harder on parents who are
trying to figure out what their kids have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell their kids what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it harder on our police force,
too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a pathway here that will make
it easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pathway is to recognize that
prohibition as a strategy has not worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war on drugs has not worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a time where attitudes are
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attitudes are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we just have to keep diligently
talking and explaining and being authentic
[SPEAKER_00]: to our friends and neighbor and our family
members about this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And attitudes do change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see attitudes change for the
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on a number of topics,
20 or 30 years ago, you wouldn't even have
[SPEAKER_00]: spoken about the issue of gay marriage to
anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 or 30 years ago, legalization seemed
like something way in the distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the city of Seattle, by popular
vote, we went as far as we could go,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that enforcement of marijuana
laws for small amounts, the possession of
[SPEAKER_00]: small amounts, is the lowest enforcement
priority for our police.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowest enforcement priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, on that, the people led.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people led.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the politicians followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, by the way, just do us a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do us a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowest enforcement priority does not mean
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make life easier for everybody,
including our police officers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't light up in front of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make life easier for everybody,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they take the law seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the state of Washington, the people led
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And medical marijuana is legal under state
law.
Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: those laws have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've become more confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people led.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in the city of Seattle,
we're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to make sure that we do
our best to observe that state law,
[SPEAKER_00]: protect the rights of medical marijuana,
legitimate medical marijuana users,
[SPEAKER_00]: to safe access to medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not happening everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not happening in every city,
but it's happening in our city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the problem is, of course,
that our law at the city level,
[SPEAKER_00]: the laws at the state level, all exist in
a world where it is still illegal at the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't change that from here with
our votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can change more state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both people have spoken to you about
initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mentioned to you two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The politicians followed because the
people led.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initiative here in Seattle to make it
the lowest enforcement priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep leading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep leading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll do my best as an elected official
to lead, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best as an elected official to
lead, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need you to keep leading,
because if we do that, we will make these
[SPEAKER_00]: laws make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make this community better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all of you for your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor of the greatest city in the
world, Mayor Mike McGinn shows some love,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
Thank you.
