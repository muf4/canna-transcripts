Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: turn around and say hello to somebody as
you don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to somebody!
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome somebody!
[SPEAKER_02]: Give somebody a hug!
[SPEAKER_02]: Give somebody a joy!
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the largest harvest fest we've
ever had!
[SPEAKER_02]: When you call the criminalization of
health and the legalization of power,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are making a political statement that
does not conform with the standard wisdom
[SPEAKER_02]: of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The criminalization of drugs only enhances
the power of some tired, old, white males
[SPEAKER_02]: in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: who want to continue to control people of
color, poor people, women, young people,
[SPEAKER_02]: and people who disagree with the way this
nation is being run.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, it's all right in the United
States to be an alcoholics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because George Bush and his cronies
are alcoholics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is all right in this country to consume
legal drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drugs that destroy the mind, the spirit,
and the body because huge multinational
[SPEAKER_02]: conglomerates produce, manufacture,
and distribute these types of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: About getting high, about what the pigs
are doing, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense, fellas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is some Ohio hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got their band living for three
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really ridiculous stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The punishment should fit the crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, you can pistol whip somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rob a bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'll do more time messing around on
marijuana, you will do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they can get by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that the Arabs should be
legalized because there is, as I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big difference between smack-cracking
and smoking flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sick and tired of my friends being
dragged off or their houses or cars being
[SPEAKER_00]: confiscated for a joint of marijuana when
there are 500,000 deaths a year from
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol and nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get real here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I suggest you do is let's legalize
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do it if we got together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
Let's do it.
