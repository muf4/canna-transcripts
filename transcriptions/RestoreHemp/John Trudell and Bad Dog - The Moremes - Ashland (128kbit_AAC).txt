[SPEAKER_00]: There's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the other me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are the more me's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got a domino to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been trying to work it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how your life turned or what
any of that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But me and the me's, we're not going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we couldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any skeletons in our closets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our own private stash of bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That scream with no choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no scream like the next scream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing the present into nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: While eternity is now, not then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's divided into what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many does that make?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's love that loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that fears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that possesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that needs proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the love that likes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the love that accepts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that likes, that cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no forgetting some realities
destiny threw at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fate wasn't much help with its way of
loading the load when it was up to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: To carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't have any say.
To carry it.
To carry it.
To carry it.
To carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the land where the lie is king.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using fear like glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretending, pretending isn't pretending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each and every one of us have seen the
glories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each and every one of us want the glories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not a one of us likes the way we fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes straying is a way of walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: When staying isn't an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've been accused of some things
we did and some things we didn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are, I forgive you's, that lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and the me's are looking for a me that
will answer to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far there's no one who will.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the other me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are the more me's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got a domino to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been trying to work it out.
So far there's no one who will.
There's me.
There's the other me.
There's the other me.
There's the other me.
There's the other me.
There's the other me.
There's the other me.
There's the other me.
There's the other me.
There's the other me.
