[SPEAKER_00]: We all have to really have each other's
backs now because it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be a part of that acceleration and
let's set our political prisoners free in
[SPEAKER_00]: this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of people in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that need to be
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this song goes out to them.
When is my brother going to be free?
Hey.
Hey oh hey hey hey.
Hey oh hey hey.
Hey oh hey.
Hey oh hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them what's going on down in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many years, no disrespect in this
unharmonie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time for human rights and set them people
free.
That ain't all, tear down the border wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're going to make that final
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: They set him up, that's plain to see.
Time to set him free.
Free land, no tear.
We free the Calabasas, we can free the
Native Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of freedom fighters out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're fighting for human rights to
make this world a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank my brother here, Jim Anderson.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go back a long ways and we've always
fought for human rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe in this medicine, this
marijuana is a great medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it heals all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's only one thing that we ask
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's real easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's called love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honor Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect water, because without water
there's no life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to all my relations here, I thank you
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful
weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's beautiful people here and all the
people that work so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially my brother, Evian here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does so great, he works so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he said, he picks up every piece of
paper, every cigarette butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you people can help pick up a little
bit of garbage before you leave,
[SPEAKER_02]: it really helps the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it once again, like I said,
once again, to all my relations,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy HIPAAA!
