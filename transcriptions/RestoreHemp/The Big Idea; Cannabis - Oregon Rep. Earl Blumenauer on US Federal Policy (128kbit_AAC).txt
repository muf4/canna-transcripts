[SPEAKER_00]: President Obama famously said in 2012,
after the Colorado and State of Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: votes, when asked, you know, were they
going to interfere, he said he had bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: fish to fry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has been quite clear that there are
other things that are perfectly legal that
[SPEAKER_00]: are more problematic and dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clarification with Deputy Attorney
General Cole, setting out parameters by
[SPEAKER_00]: which the federal government is going to
not fry those smaller fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there are 93 U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorneys, some of whom have been frying
small fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw an outrageous case here in
Oregon this summer where the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney's Office was going to prosecute a
Native American teenager by all accounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: an exemplary young man, for the possession
of the equivalent of marijuana cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, as you pointed out in your
introduction, has been decriminalized in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon since 1973.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several others in the delegation were
inquiring as to what their prosecutorial
[SPEAKER_00]: priorities are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there not any drug kingpins,
organized crime, white collar crime?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ultimately dropped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is absolute schizophrenia with
the DEA, which is out of step with the
[SPEAKER_00]: president and his pronouncements.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it took them until last year to
actually acknowledge publicly that
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is not more dangerous than
methamphetamines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A stunning admission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've seen maybe the weekend news in
the Washington Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked about the failures of DEA to
deal with the opioid epidemic that is
[SPEAKER_00]: literally killing tens of thousands of
people in recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're in a situation where
Secretary Clinton, if she's elected,
[SPEAKER_00]: will build on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she is quite open to dealing with
fixing the two big problems that the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has in terms of taxation and in
terms of banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And allowing the states to go their
separate ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am optimistic that Congress will make
the job easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a Clinton administration will
build on the foundation and perhaps move
[SPEAKER_00]: it a little further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a man who doesn't agree
with himself hour by hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as God is my witness, if he said that
he was either going to prosecute or
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize, we don't know what he would say
the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doesn't know what he'd say the next
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mercifully, I think we will be spared
the specter of him trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what his beliefs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he will inflict on the American
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least through government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll still have him inflicted on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to turn off the
television, shut down the computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: or fold the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hold the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to keep the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off those other sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll stop covering them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
