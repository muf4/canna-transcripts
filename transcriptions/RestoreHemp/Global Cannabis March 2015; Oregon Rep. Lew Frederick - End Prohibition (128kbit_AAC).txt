[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings from Northeast Portland and from
the capital and from Salem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I'm not going to talk long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you all have been here for a long
day already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to update you on what's
going on in Salem right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you probably know, it's the
passage of 91 was just the beginning of a
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laws don't spell out all the procedures
required to make them work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that's being hammered out by
the Oregon Liquor Control Commission,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some of it in the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, yesterday, the OLCC put together
a group of committees that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at rules and licensing and quality
and financing and extracts and infused
[SPEAKER_00]: items and growers are going to look at all
those different issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to tell you, I'm not going to
talk about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to I know that I was asked to speak
because of a bill I introduced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the start the process of
cleaning up some of the effects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that bill, thirty three
seventy two, probably isn't going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it through the process this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, another bill will.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it won't do everything I'd hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Mick Jagger would have been talking
about the legislative process,
[SPEAKER_00]: he he said, you can't always get what you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's important to recognize the
extreme criminalization of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana related activities has done more
harm to our communities than the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: itself ever could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Combined with measure 11, it put a lot of
people behind the bar behind bars and gave
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people felony records for actions
that will not be criminal in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: A stent in prison is not the end of one
so-called debt to society.
[SPEAKER_00]: A felony record can follow you for the
rest of your life, closing doors to
[SPEAKER_00]: housing and employment, disrupting
families and dragging the whole community
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have learned that from the
experience of alcohol prohibition in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1920s and early 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had to run the experiment again,
it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now as we come to our senses and
create a system in which cannabis is legal
[SPEAKER_00]: but regulated in the future, we also need
to do something about the harm that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: done by the prohibition in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I introduced a bill to
create a path to the expungement of
[SPEAKER_00]: records of nonviolent marijuana related
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reduction of sentences for similar
offenses for people who are still in
[SPEAKER_00]: custody or under supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high priority for me to do
something about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while I won't deny that crime
affects our community and I won't deny
[SPEAKER_00]: that incarceration sometimes is an
appropriate response to criminal acts,
[SPEAKER_00]: I also believe it has been used too often
where it makes no sense at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating criminals out of people who are
doing no harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fix that for the future and
also reach back and fix what has happened
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, 3372 is not going to make
it, but details matter a lot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislative process and we just couldn't
work out through the details in the time
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand, however, that there will be
another bill coming through the Senate and
[SPEAKER_00]: House Committee on implementing Measure
91.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the capital, that's called the Joint
Committee on Marijuana, just so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's a joke and everyone seems to
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for some of the folks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge you to use the online Oregon
Legislative Information System,
[SPEAKER_00]: OLIS, look that up, O-L-I-S, to keep
informed about what the committee is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you'll pay more attention to
this, make more attention to more than
[SPEAKER_00]: this one issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want you to make this issue your
gateway issue for more involvement in our
[SPEAKER_00]: policy making process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our system works better when people watch
and take part and that means you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to also just thank you for
coming out and being so active in the
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign last year and stay active.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have you continue to listen to
what's going on, to watch, to talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know who your legislators are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know who your legislators are?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you know who your legislators
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you need to look it up and
find out who that is and go and talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you're watching and
that you want to have some things changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I don't think my particular
bill is going to make it through,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I believe we will get a bill that will
come through in some form, that will work,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will certainly make things a little
better for the folks who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: incarcerated, who have records,
and who are presently incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll get some changes and that will
only become because you decide to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
