[SPEAKER_00]: Global warming is a real thing,
and so is legalization in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to admit that it hasn't played
out the way that I hoped it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping that they would follow the
law as we wrote it, not rip it to shreds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially not endanger our medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's my challenge for every one
of you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow a lot of you on Facebook,
and I see you out there complaining about
[SPEAKER_00]: what you don't like about how things are
playing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to know that you have the
opportunity, every time you post one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things on Facebook, you can send it
to your representative and let them know
[SPEAKER_00]: how you feel too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send it to the committee that's
making these rules, most of which you have
[SPEAKER_00]: never smoked a joint in their lives,
much less have a clue about how the plan
[SPEAKER_00]: works for the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop posting it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it to your representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook is not real, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your representatives are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them in the time it takes you
to write one of those posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can send that note via email or,
my favorite thing to do, call their office
[SPEAKER_00]: number on a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go straight to voicemail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody puts you on hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You leave your message that says,
save our medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save the 60,000 plus people who are
registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save our children who need this medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stop the overregulation and
ridiculousness that they're trying to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: with legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pissed off still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been fighting this fight for 15
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll fight it for 15 more until these
people get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys can help me do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what organization you're with
out here or who you don't like and who you
[SPEAKER_00]: do like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of us can contact our
representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we start doing that, just like
how we got Ellen Rosenblum, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish that everybody who ever smoked
weed was here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's time for things to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so happy to see people like Jennifer
Valley and Jesse Sponberg running for
[SPEAKER_00]: public office and being vocal about their
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to remove the stigma that we
suffer as cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty fed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you pissed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fight is not over, nor will it be,
until everyone is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see everybody out of prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see nobody going back to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see parents being able to choose
what kind of medication they want for
[SPEAKER_00]: their children, for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, as a stoner for 46 years,
I just want to go home after work and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a joint instead of drinking a beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't make me a bad person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happen to like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay my taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make my car payments pretty much on
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, I'm just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are plenty of other stoners out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you don't do anything else
in the upcoming year, when you post those
[SPEAKER_00]: posts on Facebook, copy and paste them and
send them to your representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them to that joint committee and let
them know that we're not going to stand
[SPEAKER_00]: for this over-regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: $5,000 for a dispensary license,
$400 for a liquor license.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's discrimination, and I'm sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Anna Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a proud stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me, and let's be free at last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
