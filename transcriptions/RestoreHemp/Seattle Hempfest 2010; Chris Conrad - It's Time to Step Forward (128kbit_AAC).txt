[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Conrad is an author, a
court-qualified cannabis expert,
[SPEAKER_00]: and publisher of the West Coast Leap.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing this as long as we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Conrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vivian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hello, Seattle!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, did I mention how much I love you
guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I love about it so much is
that we're down in California in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put Proposition 215 on the ballot and
legalized medical marijuana in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two years later, you guys came right
up, stepped up to the plate, and voted to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize medical marijuana here in
Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like a little buddy up the hill
here that we just keep an eye out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, come on and join us when you get
the chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the march to legalization is a
long march.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a straight trip like a lot of
people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people in California right now
think that the way they legalize marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: is that somewhere there's a cliff,
and a cliff is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless it's illegal, then at some
point you're going to walk and walk again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk up to the edge of that cliff and
you step off, and it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: straight plunge right down, right down,
right down, and you hit legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here to tell you that's not the way
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you step off a cliff, just bad news,
you're going to get hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you get to legalization is you
take the steps one at a time and you make
[SPEAKER_00]: the progress forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: For five years, Jack Herr and I marched up
and down the state of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: educating people to put the California
Health Initiative on the ballot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were never able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were saying, you know, we've got to
get it all, we've got to get it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then along came Proposition 215,
and it wasn't all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, well, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shoulder to shoulder, we took
California back and gave it to the people
[SPEAKER_00]: of California to have that freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Dennis Perona, we fought,
we struggled, and then we thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people who have medical needs,
they get in trouble, they get busted,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can go to court, and they get a
defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went to the legislature,
and we struggled, and we went back year
[SPEAKER_00]: after year for seven years in a row to the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got SB 420 that allows
dispensaries to sell marijuana for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients around the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here we are in the great year of
2010, and we have Proposition 19 on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition 19, that was the same number
that the California Legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative had in 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come back 38 years later, and we get
the same number, like it's a sign from the
[SPEAKER_00]: universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the first time, maybe you
didn't do enough work, but now you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for history to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the fulcrum, the pinpoint in
California, ready to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a leap into the void.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a step of modest change,
but it's a step that will make the stigma
[SPEAKER_00]: go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big stigma, what's so bad about
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: November the 3rd in California,
that may turn out no longer to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm gonna come back here,
and I'm gonna hear in 2011 that this very
[SPEAKER_00]: state, Washington, and the people here
from the hemp fest coalesced and stood
[SPEAKER_00]: together to step forward and legalize
marijuana here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've marched around the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the million march for marijuana
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take step by step forward into the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's something you might not want to
hear, but it's true, is it takes money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hemp fest needs your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to put some money into hemp fest
to have hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like California to legalize
marijuana so that you can legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana up here, we need some money to
come down to California to help Prop 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is the oil of politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but when it comes time to lubricate
the gears of justice, we can't keep giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it our blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to give it our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to give it our sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to lubricate history in order for
us to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ask you now, will you join me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you join Jack Herr?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you join Amsterdam and step into the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're ready for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Chris Conrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about history as it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the West Coast Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time and thank you hemp
fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Conrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
