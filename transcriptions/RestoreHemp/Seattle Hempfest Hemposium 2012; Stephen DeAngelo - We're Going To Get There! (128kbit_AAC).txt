[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years of doing this I've learned not to
set deadlines There were times before like
[SPEAKER_00]: 1978 when we thought we had this thing in
the bag and then events beyond our control
[SPEAKER_00]: intervene And in some cases we didn't do
such a good job and things changed So I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like to set timelines, but we all
know where we're gonna end up,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know where we're going,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's just a matter of putting one
foot in front of the other until we get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely gonna get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
Thank you.
You
