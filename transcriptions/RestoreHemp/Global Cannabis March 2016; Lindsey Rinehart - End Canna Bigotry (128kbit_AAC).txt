[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Global Cannabis March!
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so happy to be one of the newest
board members for Portland Normal in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislative director capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to work with Lee Berger as the
legislative committee director as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other board members to try to
impact the Oregon cannabis laws on behalf
[SPEAKER_00]: of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this last session I lobbied on behalf
of Portland Normal and on behalf of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: us to try to get reasonable regulations
met instead of regulations that we might
[SPEAKER_00]: not be so happy with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the OLCC is very proud of
themselves recently for issuing eight grow
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses, we've had those applications
since January.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important that we move
forward in a more timely manner than that
[SPEAKER_00]: when people have plants in the ground and
ready to go in the ground and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: covered legally even though they very much
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked really hard on trying to get the
lounges to stay open and because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Clean Air Act these weren't deemed
an emergency and so we weren't allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them passed in this very short amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we did get expungement for
criminal records more thoroughly than was
[SPEAKER_00]: previously there and we got other
penalties reduced so that we could have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more freedom in the things that
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we're going to be doing a
consumer bill of rights where we will be
[SPEAKER_00]: tackling the issues of the Oregon Clean
Air Act and the issues of pre-employment
[SPEAKER_00]: drug screening and your landlord being
able to discriminate against you because
[SPEAKER_00]: you consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to get moving
forward on these things because we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that our rights are just as
equal as those that might be choosing
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol as the substance of choice even
though ours is far safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to say that if people could
please join us at the Rules Advisory
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee meetings for the Oregon Health
Authority and the OLCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the rules are actually
drafted from the legislation and the bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: of the discussion happens for us to be
able to make these regulations and without
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of input from our community we are
seeing the results of their not hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more input at these meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email it but when they release a
regulation that is ridiculous you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: use your voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to tell them that what they're
doing is ridiculous and it can't be as
[SPEAKER_00]: simple as we're defending our OMMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to read what they wrote and tell
them what is wrong with it and without
[SPEAKER_00]: that feedback we're getting this crap
legislation rules that nobody can handle
[SPEAKER_00]: or deal with or wants to because they're
not hearing from enough of us and even
[SPEAKER_00]: when they do hear from us sometimes they
just choose to do what they want instead
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why patients can't get their
extracts right now in bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bulk of the reason is because we were
not heard so we need to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're defending ourselves and our patients
who are us because if we don't we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what happens and it's their choice
that they already made.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already decided that they were going
to redo the OMMP so if we don't give them
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our input all of the time they're
going to do that without us and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: scary thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to hear what your doses are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OHA limiting a patient's dose is
complete bullshit and it should have never
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and when we tried to get an
amendment to say that the OHA couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: limit a patient's dose it was pretty much
decided that they had that power because
[SPEAKER_00]: the county health authorities wanted to
make sure that we regulated it for
[SPEAKER_00]: children in case they got inside of it
instead of getting into regulated for
[SPEAKER_00]: adults who consume it responsibly and keep
it out of the hands of their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're moving into a long session in
January.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be six months long and we're
going to see copious amounts of bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're going to try to pass and it's
going to be up to each and every one of us
[SPEAKER_00]: to stand up for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to defend our programs and we have
to make sure that while they're rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: out new programs that it's done
responsibly the more voices that they hear
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that the better and there's no way
that any of us can let the OMMP fall to
[SPEAKER_00]: the wayside during this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already saw what can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please pay attention to the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on the OMMP website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at their calendars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at their news releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on the OLCC website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skip out on you know 20 minutes of
Facebook and go read these websites and
[SPEAKER_00]: these regulations and start to really
understand how you can give your input on
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think because we all think very
similarly on most of these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more of that united voice that they
hear the better we're going to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please join us in defending these
things because we need to all be united
[SPEAKER_00]: with love and understanding and acceptance
but also with the strong desire to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love guys.
Thank you.
