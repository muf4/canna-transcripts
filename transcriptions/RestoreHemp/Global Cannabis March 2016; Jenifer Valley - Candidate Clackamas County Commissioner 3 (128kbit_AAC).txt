[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I am the only candidate running
for Clackamas County Commissioner that
[SPEAKER_00]: voted in favor of Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important that all of us who
voted for Measure 91 get involved in our
[SPEAKER_00]: communities at every level.
[SPEAKER_00]: City, county, state, doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all really need to be involved and
talking to Oregon Health Authority,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially because they're the ones who
are running our medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now I am running for Clackamas
County Commission because when we
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized marijuana, 57% of Clackamas
County voters voted in favor of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not one of our Clackamas County
Commissioners did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided to go with their vote
when it came time to make regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't consider the fact that they
were on the losing side of that vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of opting out of legalization,
they decided to zone it out and they made
[SPEAKER_00]: it nearly impossible to start a cannabis
business in Clackamas County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made me mad enough to want to run
for office and let them know that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you'll all support me in my run
and I'd like to see you all out there at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Oregon Health Authority meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to margin!
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to margin!
