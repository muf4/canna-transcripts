[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with something we had
last week as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a bottle of Father D'Alessi's cough
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a full bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is circa 1908, 1910.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right at 98 to 100 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this bottle contains a cough remedy
that's been shown never to fail,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to the little letters on the
side of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, indica, heroin, alcohol,
and chloroform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's guaranteed never to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably just knock you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you don't take too
much or you won't even breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is an antique, and it's part of the
THCF Medical Museum that you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of some of this collection on the
web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it, we have a label under a
glass bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from an apothecary or a drugstore
circa the 1880s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about a dozen bottles like this in
our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next door, we have the cannabis hemp oil
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is seed oil, high in omega-3,
6, and 9, the LA, GLA, and LNA oils that
[SPEAKER_00]: are essential to our lives and cell
formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take six or eight of these a day for the
good, healthy, fatty fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you press hemp seeds and get the
seed oil out, after you press it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have this leftover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp flour is a protein-enriched,
gluten-free, whole grain flour that
[SPEAKER_00]: imparts the nutty flavor of hemp into a
wide variety of baked goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next door, we have hemp nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are hulled hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste like, as we said earlier,
a cross between sunflower seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: walnuts, and cashews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm, they are good.
