[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm being H-I-G-H-I.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a spectacular day here in Potland,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bear with me a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: My PTSD is kicking a little hard right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just bear with me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we have to say to our state again,
what's wrong with all these changes you
[SPEAKER_00]: keep making that continue to happen and
have happened to our cannabis medical
[SPEAKER_00]: program in the last year or so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always somebody or something has tried to
change us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave our medicine alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be the words that have been
said or used by most.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times have you said it or heard
someone else say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gee, do you think anybody's listening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we can hear ourselves saying
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's listening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our state had one of the best medical
cannabis programs to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a multi-state medical cannabis card
holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that medical has paved the way for
recreational, recreational will ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: take over and be servicing our O-M-M-P in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disappointed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Disappointed is one of the strongest words
that this Oregonian can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, like a lot of you, have had to make
constant change in the past few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social clubs closing because of the Clean
Air Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: My markets closed because they couldn't be
regulated by the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was more important for them to
be treated with pharmaceuticals than the
[SPEAKER_00]: choice of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else must we give up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not willing to give up my
medical cannabis card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they end this program, they will be
literally ripping the card out of my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hands, my friends' hands, my family's
hands seems like paying it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forward or giving back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon can be the ultimate reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: In closing, I would love to take this time
as Portland Hemstock's hospitality manager
[SPEAKER_00]: to invite you all to Hemstock this year
down at Waterfront Park, September 24th
[SPEAKER_00]: and 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say in closing also that these
people are extremely missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, John Walsh, John Trudell,
Craig Pryor, Jack Hare, and many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank them again for all
their efforts that they put into these
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to march with my P4P group and I
hope you are too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come check out our booth in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and show great stonerism.
