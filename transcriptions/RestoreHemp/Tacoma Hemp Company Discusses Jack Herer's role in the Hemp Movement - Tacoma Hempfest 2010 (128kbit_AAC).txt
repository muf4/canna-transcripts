[SPEAKER_00]: One of the important things that I feel
for people to know and one of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons that I'm doing the things that I
do are because of Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who are unaware,
Jack Herrera is a man that you,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've had anything to do with cannabis
in about the last 30 years or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you basically owe this man a big thank you
and unfortunately he is no longer with us
[SPEAKER_00]: to thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I wanted to do
at this First Hemp Fest in Tacoma that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do this afternoon is we're
going to have a moment of silence for Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herrera at 420 instead of the usual Hemp
Fest 420 moment, which has been surprising
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a few people today when they've
heard about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting to hear, you know,
how many blunts are you going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, absolutely none.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be dead quiet for one
moment and we're all going to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the people that have been
lost for this movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emery is a man that's sitting in a
prison up 30 miles from where I stand
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and he's in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, he's not in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in a federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a holdover from the Bush era drug
war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous that Canada allowed a
Canadian citizen to be extradited for a
[SPEAKER_00]: crime that only holds a $200 fine in his
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: At worst, at the absolute worst,
he was looking at a $200 fine in his
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They extradited him and gave him to a
country, a foreign country that is almost,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're trying to get him life in
prison for selling seeds to a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know is not harmful, is not going
to hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is not worth life in prison for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the main drives that
I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If more people kind of understand just how
important Jack Herrera was and the
[SPEAKER_00]: research that he did and just the
awareness that he brought to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I found on a 38
year old male, I've been using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: since I was seven years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first read The Emperor Wears No
Clothes, I was 17 years old and it
[SPEAKER_00]: completely changed my outlook and attitude
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea how much information was
actually out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reading that book and understanding
how much research and just devotion you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have to find these things that
have been deceptively hidden by the
[SPEAKER_00]: government for decades, that takes some
effort and that deserves some recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of the newer
generation of people that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to cannabis don't necessarily
understand how important the people are
[SPEAKER_00]: that have gone before you because what
they're not seeing is how those people
[SPEAKER_00]: influence people like me, people like you,
people like anybody that does this kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that does work for the cannabis
community at the level that I feel I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: they know these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat them with some respect and you
think about the history involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys like Ed Rosenthal, so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many people, I couldn't name
them all, but all the breeders that have
[SPEAKER_00]: ever come up with anything that you've
ever tried, that you've enjoyed or you've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard about, those are the people that you
don't necessarily need to go patting them
[SPEAKER_00]: on the back or anything, but at least give
them a little bit of thought instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just where's your next bag coming from and
what's it gonna be and strive for some
[SPEAKER_00]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people gave a lot over the course of
their lives and it deserves some
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This testimony right here has proved,
Jack, that you might be gone from us,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'll never leave this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you, Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
