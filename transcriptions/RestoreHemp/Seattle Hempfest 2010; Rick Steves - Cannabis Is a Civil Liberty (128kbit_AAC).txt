[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring in the economic needs of an
economic crisis I mean consider alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: would have not have been the prohibition
against alcohol would not have been
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped had there not been a great
depression Because they realized it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid waste of money I mean it's
unfortunate from my point of view because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just really into the civil liberties
aspect of it That it would be an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis that legalizes marijuana,
but I guess I'll take it any way we can
[SPEAKER_00]: all right now what I want to talk about
today is just Let's just look at my notes
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very It's not very cohesive or or
sort of like a pep rally thing I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: very cohesive little pep rally talk I'll
give them the main stage later today But
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are sitting here out of a
hundred thousand people are interested who
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of interested in how do we bring
this to the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to share with you my
experience lately I've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different angles on this that are kind of
unique first of all I've spent a third of
[SPEAKER_00]: my adult life hanging out with Europeans
Who think a joint's about as exciting as a
[SPEAKER_00]: can of beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not a big deal over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at it And they just kind of
think whoa didn't you guys get over a
[SPEAKER_00]: reaper madness like like before the war?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know it's still alive and well in
our society I've also had ten years now
[SPEAKER_00]: being outspoken as a you know respectable
part of the business community as a church
[SPEAKER_00]: leader and somebody that has some sort of
a celebrity that you got to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: and Against all conventional wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been honest about my beliefs in this
I've come out You know I mean when gay
[SPEAKER_00]: people were coming out a couple of decades
ago and how courageous That was well
[SPEAKER_00]: there's I mean there's a there's 50 people
that love pot for anyone that's here being
[SPEAKER_00]: honest about I'll be honest with you when
I first came to Hempfest the people here
[SPEAKER_00]: scared me You know it's a freaky world I
mean look at these guys, and then I saw it
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Vivian helped me Vivian explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one time a year when we can
take this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording You know and that's a
beautiful thing and it gave me great
[SPEAKER_00]: respect for freedom the irony is we're
more into freedom and the Constitution and
[SPEAKER_00]: what America's all about and all these
people that think we're problems And we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to go over there and not scare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our challenge Well, we don't that's
that's so clear to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I decided to wear my dorky
jacket today You know I want to put a non
[SPEAKER_00]: scary face on this drug policy issue And
this panel that was just up here was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying some very wise ideas about how do
we frame this issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we don't preach to the choir,
but when we preach to people out there who
[SPEAKER_00]: need to hear this I've also had some
interesting time lately just getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: know police and people in law enforcement
and respecting their opinion on this I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to share that too, so I'm going to
just kind of weave some ideas together for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next half hour here about that first
of all Mr. Kerlikowski had one of his guys
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tracking me and listening to all
my talks and so on and and because they
[SPEAKER_00]: were worried about what we what we were
thinking and apparently it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: Threatening them and then you got warm
stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually talking some common sense
and so what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to know this man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a wonderful man very caring man,
and he's diametrically opposed to us He
[SPEAKER_00]: just thinks marijuana is the root of all
equal evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is he involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: He cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: I care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both care Let's understand what makes
each other tick and you know after a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while we had dinner and he asked me
Why are you into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a well-off white guy in the suburbs
you could smoke pot for the rest of your
[SPEAKER_00]: life and email all your friends They come
on over smoking pot and you're never going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get any trouble And I thought about you
know you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I why am I in this because I am in it Just
like you are what what is motivating me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my own well-being I'm just tired
of lies in our society And this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: a million crusades you could speak out on
and this is one crusade that decent people
[SPEAKER_00]: are afraid to speak out People say it's
courageous People say it's courageous to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak out about marijuana and Just the
fact that it's courageous to speak out on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana if you care about freedom
there's reason to speak out on marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never said smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it's a civil liberty to smoke
pot if you choose to smoke pot I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: very strongly that it is the responsible
adult Recreational no apologies necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: it just makes my music more fun
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this long dinner with this
police officer who was the leading
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics kind of guy in Seattle And he
refuted everything I said except for one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing he said I can't argue with your
civil liberties idea It's perfectly common
[SPEAKER_00]: sense perfectly common sense It's the
civil liberties thing that really I think
[SPEAKER_00]: can resonate as a matter of principle if
you care about freedom it's It is a civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty to enjoy giving high I would never
say you should get high as a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: fact I think it's really important to be
honest about the downside of pot I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking out I get these rich women's
groups hiring me to go to deep south and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about travel And I talk about
marijuana You know I mean they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: inclined to hire a guy to come and talk
about drug policy But I talked to him
[SPEAKER_00]: about Europe and I bring that into it and
what I really like to do Is have
[SPEAKER_00]: credibility by shooting off all the
torpedoes am I saying you should smoke pot
[SPEAKER_00]: no am I saying kids should smoke pot no of
course not am I saying it's okay to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're intoxicated No, you should
throw the book at them am I saying healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: no, it's not healthy It can be addictive
it can mess you up, but that doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it should be criminal You can take the
crime out of it, and you can deal with it
[SPEAKER_00]: as Europeans deal with it in the form of
pragmatic harm reduction Now for eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years when Bush was president as soon as
you had any kind of a proposal that had
[SPEAKER_00]: the word harm reduction in it It was not
even read it was just thrown away because
[SPEAKER_00]: harm reduction is code for legalization
now we can talk about harm reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pragmatism that turns me out
about European drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the same kind of challenges
that we did You know the thing they do it
[SPEAKER_00]: differently they do it with the pragmatism
So our challenge is to get out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: not be scary find yourself in a circle
where people go wow I never dreamed you
[SPEAKER_00]: Would be talking about marijuana in this
progressive way and then get their
[SPEAKER_00]: attention span and talk to them I've done
it on TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it on radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it in churches I've done it in
conservative groups done it with rotary
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs and afterwards people are thankful
for you bringing a little bit of Logic and
[SPEAKER_00]: common sense they don't need to agree with
you, but all of a sudden they understand
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not just a bunch of heads wanting
everybody to turn in and tune out and drop
[SPEAKER_00]: out or something like that because that's
what they're thinking There's a thoughtful
[SPEAKER_00]: reason To be waging the crusade that we're
waging So I said I've spent a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe and it's fun to be in Europe and
one cool thing about being in Europe is
[SPEAKER_00]: you see your country from a distance and
you when you step away from your country
[SPEAKER_00]: you see the quirky things about your
society good and bad in high contrast and
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden you realize more who you
are and where you live I talked to this
[SPEAKER_00]: this this man who spent 30 years of his
life working in New York like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Greeks do it is retired Goes back to his
home country he gets back home and it
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs to him He never took a nap for the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't okay And then he goes back
to Greece and it's okay to relax take a
[SPEAKER_00]: nap I spent so many years taking my tour
groups to Germany and trying to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to just take off their clothes and relax
in the spa and Americans just can't do it
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else can we are so uptight about
so many silly things My TV show actually
[SPEAKER_00]: airs only after 10 o'clock in some markets
in this country Because we have 500 year
[SPEAKER_00]: old marble penises and 300 year old canvas
breasts This is America You go to I was
[SPEAKER_00]: just in Frankfurt and they have a place
called cafe fix right at the main street
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's where all the junkies go to get
their merit their heroin maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: clinic advice and counseling and And deal
with their habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very progressive in-your-face
ugly kind of thing Well, I think they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a progressive approach to hard drug
problems in Europe that would put to shame
[SPEAKER_00]: our our policies and This is one thing
that I like to try to introduce to
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans as a travel writer as a travel
writer I feel like my job is kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the medieval jester, you know the Middle
Ages the jester He would go out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: who found other people in the in the
gutters He'd come back into the castle and
[SPEAKER_00]: he could tell the king the truth the king
wouldn't tell Because the king needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: know the truth the king actually paid the
jester his room and board to be annoyed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the jester for him to come in and tell the
Root jokes everybody was talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: king out there outside of the castle Well,
we need to be jester's we need to go out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and find out what the rest of the
world student come home And that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful thing about travel and that's
one thing I try to do in my travel writing
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fear in our society right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed it fears being used
against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fear about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fear about Terrorism there's fear
about everything and that was just one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I like to do my travels is go places
where you're supposed to be afraid and
[SPEAKER_00]: just see if There's anything to that fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just in Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was afraid to go to Iran I almost left
my big camera in Athens because I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd be throwing stones at us as soon as
they saw an American film from the streets
[SPEAKER_00]: of Tehran I got there and all of a sudden
I realized I've never enjoyed such a warm
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome on the streets of any city in the
world as when I was in Iran I was in a
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic jam stuck in a traffic jam with my
driver to big city 10 million people I
[SPEAKER_00]: think in Tehran We're going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My driver just bursts out death to traffic
And I thought wait a minute I thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: was death to Israel or death to America
says no right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's death to traffic You know and he said
I said well what's with that you said here
[SPEAKER_00]: in our country whenever we're frustrated
by something That's just out of our
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say death to that so all of a sudden
that lived experience for me Let me have a
[SPEAKER_00]: more sophisticated and nuanced
understanding of what death to United
[SPEAKER_00]: States means in a rally outside of our
embassy Now that's how travel can overcome
[SPEAKER_00]: some fear There's also that about all
sorts of other Alternative lifestyles and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you travel you have that joy and as a
travel writer as I mentioned I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring that home and I can give you lots of
different examples of that when I think
[SPEAKER_00]: about my Interest in marijuana it goes
back also to how casual marijuana is in
[SPEAKER_00]: many cultures I mean of course you go
around much of Europe and marijuana is
[SPEAKER_00]: just it's not a big deal I'm always
talking about it like it's a big deal
[SPEAKER_00]: because in our country you can do hard
hard time for it and the Europeans think
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets it over I mean most Dutch people
have never smelled marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something That's that some young
people do as a stage and a few people that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're artistic kind of you know Crazies
and they enjoy marijuana all their life,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's just fine It's not an issue the
very interesting when you travel and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested in their policy when you
go to Europe is you find there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental difference in Europe time and
time again my European friends tell me a
[SPEAKER_00]: society has to make a choice tolerate
alternative lifestyles or build more
[SPEAKER_00]: prisons They always they always are
interested in tolerance They're proud of
[SPEAKER_00]: how few people they incarcerate in the
United States We incarcerate eight times
[SPEAKER_00]: as many people per capita as Europeans do
Eight times as many people when you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe you find that they have drug
problems They lost 8,000 people to heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoses last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost 18,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a serious problem in both societies
How do they do it they've got 400 million
[SPEAKER_00]: people we've got 300 million people
they've got progressive laws where they've
[SPEAKER_00]: got their Cafe fix on the main street to
give people their heroin and their
[SPEAKER_00]: counseling is on we've got locking people
up how Did they manage to lose less than
[SPEAKER_00]: half the people that we do and they've got
more people and easier laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: pragmatism harm reduction I was in Zurich
a little while ago going to a coffee just
[SPEAKER_00]: have a coffee I went downstairs to the
bathroom the lights are blue What's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on that's open the door complete blue
lights then I realized oh, I can't see my
[SPEAKER_00]: bands Couldn't shoot up if I wanted to
very frustrating and And I thought well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's interesting so they don't they've
got a public toilet Basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would have all their Junkies down
there shooting up if they didn't have blue
[SPEAKER_00]: lights now that junkies can't find their
vanes So they won't shoot up in their
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet across the street I noticed a
machine that used to sell cigarettes And
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been repainted and retooled and now
it sells government such as syringes I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like one Frank each and they're
just you know generic syringes Nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: shares needles in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no discussion about it There's no
moralistic sort of political party in
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland that says you shouldn't be
providing people needles it just common
[SPEAKER_00]: sense so you get your blue lights you got
your Heroin you got your needles dispensed
[SPEAKER_00]: from old cigarette machines and then down
the street you got your cafe fix your
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin maintenance clinic And then what
happens there is people go there for their
[SPEAKER_00]: fix they go there for medical counseling
They don't have this nervousness where
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to top up and consequently they
consume less of that drug and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves back on track They've got a
wonderful track record in Switzerland for
[SPEAKER_00]: being more progressive when it comes to
that problem Europe has found that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you take crime out of the equation And you
treat drug abuse as a health problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: an education challenge you have much more
positive results They find that if you I
[SPEAKER_00]: just learned this from the website at the
European Union They figure for every euro
[SPEAKER_00]: they put into education and counseling
they save 15 euros on police and health
[SPEAKER_00]: costs So they're they're very wellness
approach to this and one thing they've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned as I mentioned is you cannot
legislate morality Nobody's gonna say
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking pot is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's gonna say prostitution is good
But you can say it is futile to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes more sense to legislate it make
it safe and give people some Opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn about the problem and get over it
when you look at the European Union
[SPEAKER_00]: website There's no talk of marijuana as an
evil thing There is when you search for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis the only cannabis reference you
find is full problem cannabis use Problem
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use some people use it too much
they can realize on it and that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be dealt with In Germany, they think that
it's Boys smoke more pot than girls in
[SPEAKER_00]: their teenage years and they think it's
because socially boys are more nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: with girls and they smoke a little
Marijuana in order to be more comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: socially so they give them they actually
have counseling centers where they give
[SPEAKER_00]: them flirting lessons So they can because
they can flirt a little more confidently
[SPEAKER_00]: without the help of the marijuana I don't
know if that's gonna work or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is they're thinking out of
the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being pragmatic They're being
creative not making it a crime,
[SPEAKER_00]: but making it an education challenge
Here's an example of pragmatism in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: when you travel in Scandinavia in June you
find drunk teenagers in flatbed trucks
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make an ultra noise going through all
the towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's graduation party time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the kids are getting drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's paying for the parties?
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents hire the trucks hire the drivers
and host the gaggers Parents don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: their kids to get drunk on graduation But
parents in Scandinavia are pragmatic
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to know that kids will get drunk on
high school graduation No matter what you
[SPEAKER_00]: say and they would rather make sure They
don't drink and drive now that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: real tough sell in America We would rather
have the moralistic stance don't drink and
[SPEAKER_00]: then kids will drink and they will Drive
and drink and they will die as they do
[SPEAKER_00]: every year in our society That's the
American approach to us a form of drug
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse teenagers getting really drunk on
graduation time and the European approach
[SPEAKER_00]: is more honest It's more credible and
bottom line harm reduction fewer people
[SPEAKER_00]: die The blue lights thing I was talking
about that's another good example Of that
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course marijuana is considered a
soft drug rather than a hard drug It's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard when you talk about drug policy in
Europe to make a sweeping statement
[SPEAKER_00]: because every country has its own Policies
and we always zero in on the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's not fair because there are some
countries that have very regressive
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana policies but more and more
countries in Europe are making marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Quasi-legal you will find it legal
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not absolutely legal anywhere except
I think in Portugal where Consumption is
[SPEAKER_00]: legal, but sale is not and in my
experience that's because these countries
[SPEAKER_00]: are afraid to enter into a trade war with
the United States United States has huge
[SPEAKER_00]: power on Canada and on Europe not to
legalize marijuana and my friends in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denmark tell me we got to be a little bit
careful with marijuana because every year
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to arrest a couple of pot smokers
in order to maintain favorite trade status
[SPEAKER_00]: with the United States of America That's
our country That's our country Because of
[SPEAKER_00]: my research chores I have to go to a lot
of coffee shops in Amsterdam I just love
[SPEAKER_00]: to find these coffee shops in Amsterdam
and look at them for business and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just an amazing thing They've got the
loaner bongs if you don't have your own
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got your email you can check your
email while you're there There's no
[SPEAKER_00]: miners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't sell to people under 18 Older
clients don't like the edgy vibe in a
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop So they just park their
bicycle and get a little marijuana to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll go back to their place and
enjoy it the police like the existence of
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shops in Amsterdam because they
have a bulletin board where they can post
[SPEAKER_00]: information about what dangerous chemical
drugs are being sold on the streets the
[SPEAKER_00]: police really see the coffee shops in
Amsterdam as a firewall between soft drug
[SPEAKER_00]: use and hard drug abuse and it's very
effective now We're so honed in on that
[SPEAKER_00]: gateway drug nonsense that we can't hardly
imagine that But Europeans know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: only reason marijuana could ever be a
gateway drug is because of its illegality
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only thing gateway about
marijuana It's nonsense to say he smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and now he's a serial rapist
well that doesn't mean it's a gateway drug
[SPEAKER_00]: or something any more than he smoked
marijuana and now he's hooked on heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: but what is the gateway aspect of
marijuana is that if it is illegal people
[SPEAKER_00]: can only get it from criminals selling it
on the streets and those criminals have a
[SPEAKER_00]: vested interest in getting into something
more expensive more addictive and more
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable than marijuana and that's
anything hard In the Netherlands they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have that as a matter of fact it's
been 25 years in the Netherlands since
[SPEAKER_00]: they arrested anybody for marijuana and
during that time the hard drug using
[SPEAKER_00]: population is getting older and not
getting bigger it's aging and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: withering away whereas the soft drug
enjoying population is about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 10% more because of its
quasi-legality but a very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of the whole discussion to me is in
America there's a lot of fear about
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing marijuana because a lot of
frightened people out in the suburbs think
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as that's legal it's just going to
be one hemp-fest hell all of our world is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be overwhelmed by people with
weird t-shirts and funny hair and my
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling is that there's not a reservoir of
people out there wishing they could ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: their lives if only it was legal you know
in our society anybody who wants to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: pot is smoking pot anybody who wants to be
a freak is a freak it's just a free world
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can live your life the way you
want to live it Europe's experience
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got a 25-year track record on this
between 10 and 25 years depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: country is use does not go up when you get
more easy going on your laws as a matter
[SPEAKER_00]: of fact by every count and it's
frustrating to use statistics in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody during this discussion
because everyone's got an agenda who makes
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics you look at a conservative
statistics like our police do and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see all sorts of stuff you want
to see you look at liberal statistics like
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody in our camp does you're going to
see the statistics you want but across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board the statistics in the United States
and in Europe show that Americans consume
[SPEAKER_00]: double per capita the marijuana that
you're Europeans do and the Dutch consume
[SPEAKER_00]: no more than the average in Europe the
conclusion you can draw from that quite
[SPEAKER_00]: quite clearly is that how hard the laws
are do not impact how many people enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana recreationally and that's a
fundamental it's a little bit beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: attention span of the average just say no
bumper sticker person is afraid of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana but you've got to sit people
down and talk to them a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually they find this quite interesting
when you think about the situation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands you know the King County Bar
Association is a national leader in our
[SPEAKER_00]: country for thinking about the reality of
marijuana and and the pragmatism of not
[SPEAKER_00]: criminalizing it and they've also been
thinking about what happens after it's
[SPEAKER_00]: legal I went to a two or three day seminar
Roger Goodman and a bunch of guys in
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle put on and people from all over
the country came there talking about okay
[SPEAKER_00]: let's have the hypothetical situation that
marijuana is legal now how do we regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: it that's a very tough thing the Europeans
have been struggling with this and they
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't figured it out in the Netherlands
you've got that gray area you can sell it
[SPEAKER_00]: all you want but just we don't want to
know how it's wholesaled and they they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want big wholesalers they like
little boutique producers my friends who
[SPEAKER_00]: run coffee shops in Amsterdam have told me
they don't import marijuana much anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: like they used to used to get fancy
strains from all over Asia and Africa and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on now they've got the technology to
grow it locally it's safer and easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to grow locally and they get those
strains that they wanted they've got you
[SPEAKER_00]: know they've got the cannabis cup and that
sort of thing well that's what's with that
[SPEAKER_00]: well every different boutique grower like
micro brews or something is going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: their own forte and they have a contest
and see what is it almost all that is
[SPEAKER_00]: locally grown in the Netherlands they have
got to figure out how to regulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana because it is essentially legal
for instance and this is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: will allay a lot of fears in the United
States a lot of people are afraid of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legalization don't want
billboards advertising it I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody would want marijuana legalized and
advertised any more than we want hard
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor advertised everywhere you look you
know how we control that very easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: control that as a matter of fact in the
Netherlands you step into a coffee shop
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do this as my in my research to try
to think okay I'm a little bit totalist
[SPEAKER_00]: and overall I'm just a typical tourist to
be how do I know what to buy I step into a
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop I don't see a menu where's the
menu and he says you've got to push that
[SPEAKER_00]: button so I push the button and by
physically pushing the button it lights
[SPEAKER_00]: the menu and I can read it but the point
is I have to take the initiative to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the information it cannot come to me you
see what I mean it's just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: legalistic fine point but that's the
fascinating way that they've dealt with
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the Netherlands that's pragmatism
that's really thinking how can I
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish something they're not going to
advertise it to the outside world they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to have a coffee shop next to a
school they're not going to let miners
[SPEAKER_00]: have it they're going to limit it to a
small amount all this kind of thing it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating to see how they do that right
now the mayor of Amsterdam is proposing
[SPEAKER_00]: doubling the legal inventory for coffee
shops in Amsterdam right now a coffee shop
[SPEAKER_00]: can still sell literally a ton of pot over
the course of a year as long as he never
[SPEAKER_00]: has more than half a kilo in stock that's
one pound and the problem with that is of
[SPEAKER_00]: course you have all these people you know
route it's two o'clock we're out during
[SPEAKER_00]: some orange it's ten o'clock the morning
we got us another delivery and the mayor
[SPEAKER_00]: just doesn't like the traffic congestion
caused by the mayor of Amsterdam right now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a big discussion is promoting
doubling the allowable inventory limit to
[SPEAKER_00]: one kilo two point two pounds and that
would cut in half the traffic congestion
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by little pot delivery so that's an
interesting issue another interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: issue is of course Europe has gotten
smoke-free tobacco wise you can't smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco indoors in most countries in
Europe you go to the great pubs of Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be so smoky they had to put up
with it now they're completely smoke-free
[SPEAKER_00]: it's quite nice and everybody are sitting
outside with blankets around them smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking their cigarettes because you can
only smoke outside if you're a coffee shop
[SPEAKER_00]: in Amsterdam or anywhere the Netherlands
and you don't have a place to sit outside
[SPEAKER_00]: your business is at a huge disadvantage
because it's illegal to smoke tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors and Europeans like to mix their
marijuana with tobacco so if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: place outside to sit it fits your
clientele if you don't you're in trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: curiously if you're a coffee shop in
Amsterdam you can lose your license if you
[SPEAKER_00]: let people smoke tobacco but they can
smoke all the marijuana they want I had
[SPEAKER_00]: this nice dinner with a local policeman
and I learned a lot and we need to respect
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm glad we do respect the law
enforcement in our city especially during
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest and that sort of thing I mean one
thing about policemen is they're not they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't make these laws they're hired to
enforce the laws there they don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: think about the logic of a law they're
trained not to think about the logic of
[SPEAKER_00]: the law but think about enforcing the laws
and you got to be thankful there are
[SPEAKER_00]: police enforcing laws what we need to do
is not be pissed off at the police but
[SPEAKER_00]: change the law if it's a stupid one that
is good citizenship to advocate changing
[SPEAKER_00]: the law if you recognize a law that's
causing more harm than the problem it's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to address to talk to people
educate people and change it and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're doing here in a beautiful not
very fast process but in a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: process I think that what I learned from
from my discussion with this police
[SPEAKER_00]: officer is the driving mission for police
along with the enforcing the laws is
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting children and stopping violence
all right one beautiful thing about us
[SPEAKER_00]: here at Hempfest is it's a mellow crowd it
blows them away how mellow we are and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody is trying to get kids high as these
guys said in the panel before let's make
[SPEAKER_00]: that very very clear every time we talk
about legalizing the law it's not for kids
[SPEAKER_00]: you can debate 18 or 21 I think there's a
lot of wisdom in 18 just because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to force people to do illegal things
you want to be pragmatic about it but lay
[SPEAKER_00]: that concern from the start right off the
bat because the two the two things I
[SPEAKER_00]: always hear is you want all the kids to
get high and you want people driving when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're high no no you should treat it as
serious as Europe does you know Europe is
[SPEAKER_00]: much more strict on driving while
intoxicated than we are and they're much
[SPEAKER_00]: more liberal about getting intoxicated so
they're able to give people the civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberties but maintain order that's
something we can do also again cops don't
[SPEAKER_00]: care to evaluate the law they're hired to
enforce the law most policemen just think
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's trouble it's because those
people have been messing around with drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol hard drugs marijuana and they put
it all in the same ball all right so
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana has the problem of being in
there with the alcohol and the hard drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mind of a police officer I'm not
I'm not saying I understand this or agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with this it's just that's the reality
from their perspective and I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a little sense they're a little
offended by the mayor of the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana thing because they think a lot
of people just say they got chronic neck
[SPEAKER_00]: pains and they go get their card and they
just are making a sham of the whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as I mentioned we used the word
harm reduction right away they think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just that's just a front for
legalization and and the reality is they
[SPEAKER_00]: told me that the reality is you know if
you're if you're just using it responsibly
[SPEAKER_00]: and low-key it's pretty safe my feeling is
of course it's a racist law and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: classist law if you're a rich white guy
you're pretty safe if you're not wealthy
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're on the streets and if you're a
person of color you got a real serious
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and that in itself is reason to
take a hard look at this law I
[SPEAKER_00]: do want to talk about the parallels
between prohibition in the 1920s and 30s
[SPEAKER_00]: and prohibition today against marijuana
because there's all we can learn a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: from that and remember there was a lot of
discussion back in the 30s and when they
[SPEAKER_00]: finally made alcohol legal nobody was
saying booze is good there's just a broad
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition that the law is more costly
than the drug problem itself that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing today we're saying that the
law is more costly than the drug problem
[SPEAKER_00]: itself I think when we look at what's
happening today historically we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see there's this perfect storm that
comes together just like that which
[SPEAKER_00]: happened back in the 1930s and 70 years
later nobody would argue that alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: should be illegal again I think we need to
worry about our credibility and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about credibility enough that
it's that kids thing and the driving thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes back and back again my
experience a lot of people are curious
[SPEAKER_00]: well how can I talk about this in public
and I get introduced all over the place is
[SPEAKER_00]: that marijuana guy or the board member of
normal or you know with the ACLU and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people cringe my staff cringes because
my staff is worried about you know are we
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in business next year I've got
when I get underwriting for my TV show
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got you know they're all wigged out
about what are you going to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and when I get a big you're
waiting for a big magazine they'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: well promise you won't tell everybody to
go to Amsterdam and get high you know
[SPEAKER_00]: people are people are business people are
really nervous about this I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: business community is behind the
politicians and the politicians are behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the public and it's just an evolutionary
thing politicians are learning you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: the senator Cole Wells right here all over
the country I've been talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians this is not so radical to them
I mean they don't they're realizing it's
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer political suicide to talk
smartly about this issue it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got a lot of fish to fry and this
is just why do I want to get involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: this one you know but I think that we've
made a lot of progress in that way but in
[SPEAKER_00]: my experience it's the corporate world
that's so nervous about it and there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: ethics in the corporate world I mean I
mean think about Mark you know Mark Phelps
[SPEAKER_00]: right well when he got what was the deal
he was underwritten or he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: spokesperson for Kellogg's wasn't it and
and and subway sandwiches yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: Kellogg's always got rid of him as a
spokesperson because he smokes marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Kellogg's stock like Thomas 70%
subway sandwiches what is going to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of him also and they saw what happened to
Kellogg's stock and they had a meeting and
[SPEAKER_00]: they said you know this would be costly
for us to get rid of Mark Phelps in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's a plus to have Mark Phelps when
it comes to subway sandwiches and Google
[SPEAKER_00]: this check this out subway actually after
Kellogg's dumped Mark Phelps Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: Phelps subway sandwiches started an ad
campaign called eat subway sandwiches and
[SPEAKER_00]: field the bugs it's serious check it out
but what I draw from that is corporations
[SPEAKER_00]: have no moral statement they're just
reading the bottom line and if they can
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that it's not bad for their bottom
line they didn't care less if everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: high or not as long as they're spending
their money in their court every time I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: on the media talking about this it's
amazing to me how tight people get and
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's done the mics turned off they
say thank you for speaking out cross the
[SPEAKER_00]: board I've been on every station around
here you know and they're all nervous they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't believe I'm talking about it when
it's off they go thank you you're speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it they can't everybody's worried
about their jobs it's a scary time
[SPEAKER_00]: economically and with this prohibition all
the lies and all the cowardice in our
[SPEAKER_00]: public it's scary for people when ACLU
contacted me to do that half-hour video I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if you've seen it to check it
out and they did a great job it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful wonderful half-hour historical
informational documentary about the war
[SPEAKER_00]: against marijuana I learned a lot in the
process making this show have any of you
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the show the ACLU did on marijuana
time for a discussion?
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who cares about this should have
a little background on the whole situation
[SPEAKER_00]: and check it out now we have three TV
stations in our state in our city three
[SPEAKER_00]: three local stations we were gonna buy
half an hour we're gonna pay them just
[SPEAKER_00]: what you pay for a Thighmasters ad you
know and they wouldn't let us do it they
[SPEAKER_00]: would let you advertise Thighmaster but
not talking about marijuana there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much fear in the media about this because
they think you would offend and scare away
[SPEAKER_00]: your advertisers so this is a challenge
that we have to deal with and it's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrating thing for me in my own world I
have to talk about this really upfront
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of my TV stations all of my radio
stations all of my newspaper syndications
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my publishers and let them know I
am a spokesperson for the legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana I'm not in favor of smoking
marijuana I don't think it's for kids I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think you should drive while
intoxicated I think the law is causing
[SPEAKER_00]: more problems than the drug problem itself
and I think bottom line the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible recreational use of marijuana
is a civil liberty see how clear that was
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can get them to listen that long if
you can get them to listen that long and
[SPEAKER_00]: if they got half a brain they see you're
not evil all right but if you can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: them to listen they just think you're
gonna be taking all their kids into some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a hempish nightmare all right so
once in a blue moon in my travels you know
[SPEAKER_00]: my travel business somebody calls me up
and they say I just read what you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about marijuana and we're not gonna go on
your tour we're canceling out we're
[SPEAKER_00]: telling all our friends not to travel with
Rick Steves Europe either and all I can
[SPEAKER_00]: think is Europe will be much more fun
without you we have tough economic times
[SPEAKER_00]: in this country and we are really tough
and I'm surprised there's not more people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are business leaders who can't have a
little fun with honesty you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I know so many business leaders who
agree with us but because of their
[SPEAKER_00]: financial nervousness they cannot talk
about there are community leaders plot
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders respected people that understand
we're not pro drugs we're pro freedom and
[SPEAKER_00]: civil liberties and pragmatism when it
comes to dealing with drug abuse problems
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a point to talk with every one
of our congresspeople our senators our
[SPEAKER_00]: mayor our governor my pastor they know
what I think they respect me for it got my
[SPEAKER_00]: little lines down you know I know how to
shoot off the torpedoes I want them to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I think we all need to do that
if we did that more effectively we would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot farther along and we'd be able to
have a real celebration when we come to a
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering like this please think of ways
to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: okay I'm gonna just wrap it up here I
think I've gotten through all of my notes
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well I want to remind you there's
hands up to see groups out there I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't keep track of all the the wonk
there's a lot of policy wonks that I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: just blow me away how they understand all
these issues and the legislative
[SPEAKER_00]: initiatives and everything but all of us
who care about this issue and all of us
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't want to be criminals and all of
us who have friends that can't even come
[SPEAKER_00]: here because they'll lose their jobs or
they're worried about their friends all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these people need to recognize that there
are advocacy groups waging a hard and
[SPEAKER_00]: serious battle for us as experts they're
putting up lucrative careers to be working
[SPEAKER_00]: in this civil liberties struggle and you
can it's a fun thing as a citizen to shop
[SPEAKER_00]: around and choose which one turns on
everybody's got a different take on it I
[SPEAKER_00]: love the work of normal I've been a board
member of normal for nearly 10 years now
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't look at these groups like
normal as charities they are services and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're fighting a battle for me and if
you're not a paying member of some
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy group you're frankly not on board
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put on a funny t-shirt and come
down here once a year and we're never
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get anywhere join an advocacy group
make a political statement tell your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends make it not scary and bring it out
to the suburbs this is good citizenship
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you very much oh yeah thank you
thank you thank you
