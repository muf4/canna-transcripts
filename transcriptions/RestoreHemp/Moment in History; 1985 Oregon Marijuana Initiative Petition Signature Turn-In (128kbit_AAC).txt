[SPEAKER_03]: Turn it sideways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you want to stack it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here on here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that mothball smell too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure that the Marijuana
Initiative makes it on the ballot this
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we spent about $30,000 to collect
the signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask our treasurer here for that
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that it looks like you might get it on
the ballot, how do you think people will
[SPEAKER_03]: vote if this message comes out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be a hotly contested
election, and I think we will win.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're turning them in early to make sure
that the measure appears on the 86th
[SPEAKER_03]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to have the kind of problem
we had last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking advantage of a new law that
allows for early verification of
[SPEAKER_03]: signatures, and if there's a shortfall,
we'll simply go out and collect more
[SPEAKER_03]: signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty more people that will sign
the Marijuana Initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: The measure would legalize personal and
private use of marijuana for adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: What this means is that sale of any amount
of marijuana would be illegal,
[SPEAKER_03]: use of marijuana in public would be
illegal, driving into the influence would
[SPEAKER_03]: be illegal, use by minors would be
illegal, simply to allow adults to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: and possess marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: John, how would you enforce the sale?
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can grow it in your home,
how are you going to stop people from
[SPEAKER_11]: selling it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The police will stop people from selling
marijuana just like they do now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll arrest them and convict them and
put them in jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times have you tried to get this
on the ground?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the third time we've tried to get
it on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the current law or under this
proposal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, possession of less than an
ounce is a violation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possession of anything else is a class B
misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under our law, you can possess any amount
as long as it's for personal use.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as you sell any amount,
it becomes a crime.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many people did you have collecting
signatures?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about 1,000 different people
circulated the conditions.
[SPEAKER_11]: How much did it cost to get the
signatures?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think around $30,000 altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of those thousand were paid?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of that was paid circulators?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably about two-thirds was paid
petitioners and one-third was volunteer or
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps half and half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywhere from $0.25 to $0.50 per
signature?
[SPEAKER_03]: We paid only for valid signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran our own verification on all paid
petitioners and paid them only for those
[SPEAKER_03]: signatures which were valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many valid signatures do you think you
have?
[SPEAKER_03]: More than 62,521.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the signature gathering campaign,
we've sampled over 10,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very confident that this is enough
to qualify.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of those 10,000 did you find were
valid?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a precise figure,
but it was around 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the chances, from what you
can see, are better this time of winning a
[SPEAKER_02]: spot on the ballot?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard for me to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want to get into that kind
of guessing game because if it does,
[SPEAKER_02]: then someone might say that I
predetermined it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it does not, then again, I could say
question I can't win.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say this, that with this early of
a turning, the ability for us to verify
[SPEAKER_02]: and thereby having a longer time for them
to put more signatures together and file
[SPEAKER_02]: to add to this group, it's very unlikely
for them not to make the ballot even if
[SPEAKER_02]: they, in this first quarter round,
may not have enough signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the history of people dropping off
their initiative petitions, what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: usual time frame and how does this stand
in comparison?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, typically, the Constitution limits
us to 15 calendar days from the deadline
[SPEAKER_02]: for turning in, and with rare exception of
maybe only a few days, everyone turns in
[SPEAKER_02]: their initiative measure right at that
deadline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may have as many as a dozen
petitions to do all the verification of
[SPEAKER_02]: signatures within a 15 calendar day
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's absolutely no time to add
anything to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the very first one, the petition
that is, that we've gotten so early that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're able to do a verification,
thereby affording petitioners the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to obtain more signatures
should there not be a sufficient number
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that make it ballot issue number one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, right now it would be, it would be
measure number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are four, there are four measures
referred to the legislature by the
[SPEAKER_02]: assembly and those ready to have the first
four numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Upstairs today, we just submitted 87,000
signatures on the Oregon Marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: Initiative to Secretary of State Barbara
Roberts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're confident that this will be enough
signatures to qualify for the November
[SPEAKER_03]: 1986 ballot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been much more careful than last
year in collecting our signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are actually several thousand
signatures that we didn't turn in because
[SPEAKER_03]: we didn't think that they were good
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also did our own ongoing verification
process throughout the signature gathering
[SPEAKER_03]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: Altogether, we verified over 10,000
signatures and we're very confident that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have more than the 62,521 required by
law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we are today at the State Capitol
building.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just handed in 87,660 signatures and
this is Greg Mahalek who is, this is one
[SPEAKER_08]: of the people who started OMI.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's our treasurer and was one of the
three chief petitioners the first time
[SPEAKER_08]: around and I'm gonna ask Greg a couple of
questions right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, how does it feel to be
handing him in and knowing that we're on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful to be done with our third
campaign.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything to say, this is an open mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just say whatever you feel like saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: To turn him in the third time I think is
the charm.
[SPEAKER_10]: The last two campaigns serve to tell
Oregonians that this was happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is going to be the real thing and
the clincher to say we're going to win.
[SPEAKER_08]: Michael Rose, attorney for OMI.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you want marijuana legal,
Michael?
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a couple reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, as a criminal defense
attorney, I'm very tired of trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: defend people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep people out of jail for marijuana
crimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, it seems to me that as a
matter of policy and as a matter of
[SPEAKER_06]: philosophy, it ought to be no business of
the governments what people do in the
[SPEAKER_06]: privacy of their own homes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to me that marijuana prohibition
has worked no better than alcohol
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibition in the 20s and it's a
horrendous waste of time and a tremendous
[SPEAKER_06]: intrusion on the rights of people's
privacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I think marijuana ought to be
legalized.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be asking Fred why he wants
marijuana legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Golly, I still see it as a freedom issue
and I don't see it as a marijuana issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see freedom legal in this
country.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is another step on the road
to legalizing freedom.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see in our society today, in what we are
doing politically, I see a very clear
[SPEAKER_09]: confrontation, if that's the right phrase,
a very clear meeting between those people
[SPEAKER_09]: who believe in live and let live and those
people who believe in control.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those people who believe that we should
all think the same things at the same time
[SPEAKER_09]: and that the things that we think are the
things that they think.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I feel in my bones, in my being,
that I've always been involved in this
[SPEAKER_09]: fight just as perhaps I've always been a
peasant.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to get rid of the king and
live each of us our own king.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I want to see marijuana legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to go on and legalize privacy.
[SPEAKER_09]: The private acts of consenting adults.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see the collective will
restricted to protecting us from robbers,
[SPEAKER_09]: murderers, rapists, and thieves.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see violence and lying made
illegal and darn near and very little of
[SPEAKER_09]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Doug, come on over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you look to camera and explain to the
people why you want marijuana legal?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't think I've ever been a
criminal except for the one time the
[SPEAKER_07]: police arrested me for petitioning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Outside of that, just kind of always made
sense or since.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're looking for a Michael Becker
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you explain to the camera why you
would want marijuana legal?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that as a member of the
financial community, it makes great
[SPEAKER_04]: economic sense to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the money currently being
spent ineffectively and inefficiently to
[SPEAKER_04]: enforce against marijuana represents
pretty much money down the tubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, I believe Oregonians spend
somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere in that vicinity, it's probably
at least 500 million and possibly a
[SPEAKER_08]: billion.
[SPEAKER_08]: These people would be spending that money
on the legitimate economy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I see that money essentially being
filtered into a black or gray economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Money that can be directly used to benefit
social programs or any other programs the
[SPEAKER_04]: state might choose to use that money for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to be involved.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any that you know of interest in
the lumber industry recognizing that hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: is an alternative to cutting down trees
for paper products and the other
[SPEAKER_08]: industrial agricultural uses?
[SPEAKER_04]: Historically, hemp has been a very
valuable product in many respects,
[SPEAKER_04]: in many capacities it has been used.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not gauged the support in the
lumber industry for a product of that
[SPEAKER_04]: nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like the information I have is
that Europe uses hemp and that it only
[SPEAKER_08]: takes about 10% of the capital investment
of a paper plant to convert from pine
[SPEAKER_08]: trees to hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think would be necessary to
make Weyerhaeuser and these people aware
[SPEAKER_08]: of the alternative of hemp as compared to
cutting old growth for making plywood?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, they would have to be
convinced that it was economically
[SPEAKER_04]: feasible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm afraid that currently with a large
proportion of those involved in the lumber
[SPEAKER_04]: industry currently out of work,
trying to convince them to do anything
[SPEAKER_04]: would be particularly difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not known as being the most
innovative of industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a question I'm sure that will
have to be at least gauged after the fact.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we plan on dealing with the
industrial agricultural uses of hemp much
[SPEAKER_08]: more so in the future than we have in the
past.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to stick to the issues that will be
addressed to us in order to get on the
[SPEAKER_08]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we can branch out more into other
aspects of the issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the information that we have is that
there's about 30,000 different products
[SPEAKER_08]: that can be made out of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any more words?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, woo-ha!
[SPEAKER_08]: Just have a couple of free-form thoughts.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's 90 legislators that sit down in
this building every couple of years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're supposed to be the
representatives of the people of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think there's a half a dozen
of those 90 that would be in favor of OMI.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one-third of the people that are
represented among those 90 use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a situation that's very similar to
what happened at the sales tax.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those same 90 people spent two entire
legislative sessions trying to pull
[SPEAKER_08]: forward a sales tax that went down four to
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: How could these representatives have
totally misjudged the feeling of the
[SPEAKER_08]: people in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the same situation with the
marijuana issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that this unholy 90, as I call
them, they do not represent the people in
[SPEAKER_08]: many issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the marijuana issue is just another
example.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see the marijuana issue passing
four and five to one like the sales tax
[SPEAKER_08]: failed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I see it going 50% plus one vote.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all we need.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lynn Funk, why do you want marijuana
legal?
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep Oregon green.
[SPEAKER_08]: See Lynn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to have marijuana
legal because I think it's a matter of
[SPEAKER_01]: choice and the freedom to choose whatever
you want to do in your own home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, it's an infringement of your civil
liberties to have the cops come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: raid your house and go through your house
for growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's an important step in the
government infringing on other civil
[SPEAKER_01]: liberties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that they can come in and search
without warrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they can bust you and take your
property away when they wouldn't take
[SPEAKER_01]: property from murderers or rapists or
child abusers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there seems to be an unequal emphasis
on a certain subculture in our community
[SPEAKER_01]: that some of the establishment doesn't
seem to like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is their way to get at them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this is Louis.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the signature champ of this campaign.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look to camera and tell the world why you
want marijuana legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, too many of my friends have gone to
jail for doing something which they are
[SPEAKER_05]: not criminals about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that the marijuana issue is
just a smokescreen of the divisive issue,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is intended to keep people paranoid
and under the control of the police in
[SPEAKER_05]: this country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it's time for our country
to be unified and pull together instead of
[SPEAKER_05]: having divisive issues that are like
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is why I think that marijuana
should be legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are millions of Americans
who'd like to feel like they're full-time
[SPEAKER_05]: Americans and not just hiding behind some
door.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Sejo, why do you want marijuana
legal?
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, our proposal is a very
cautious, moderate approach to the
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only legalizes possession in private
for adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sale of any amount of marijuana will
remain illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use of marijuana in public will remain
illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use of marijuana by minors will remain
illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And driving under the influence of
marijuana will remain illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: America was founded on the principle of
freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our personal liberty is important in this
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adults should be free to make choices
about what they do with their own lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: We must uphold these principles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana prohibition is a complete,
utter, total, unmitigated failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: For 50 years, we've had harsh marijuana
laws, and that has not stopped millions of
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans from smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to take a look at that policy
and try something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The laws hurt us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They cause more problems than they solve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thousands of people are arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our courts are clogged.
[SPEAKER_03]: We spend millions of dollars on this law
enforcement, and it doesn't stop people
[SPEAKER_03]: from smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: The marijuana laws alienate thousands of
people from police.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have real serious crime, murder,
rape, robbery, burglary.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all need to work together to solve
these problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another reason to legalize marijuana is
because the marijuana laws are hurting us
[SPEAKER_03]: economically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here in Oregon, marijuana smokers
are spending about a billion dollars a
[SPEAKER_03]: year to buy marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: If marijuana were legalized, the price
would be way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: People could grow their own at home,
and they'd have this billion dollars to
[SPEAKER_03]: spend on legitimate goods and services.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon can enter an economic boom when we
legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another reason to legalize marijuana is
because the laws do not do anything to
[SPEAKER_03]: solve the problems that exist with
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone has a problem with marijuana,
we shouldn't throw them in jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to at least see the issue
discussed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to have Oregonians have the
chance to vote on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the Oregon Marijuana
Initiative will do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Freedom!
[SPEAKER_08]: Freedom!
[SPEAKER_08]: Freedom!
[SPEAKER_08]: Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
