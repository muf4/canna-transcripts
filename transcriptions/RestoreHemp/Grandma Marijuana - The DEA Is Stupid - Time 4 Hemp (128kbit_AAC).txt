[SPEAKER_00]: You also testified before the DEA in 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what came from that and who did
you speak with when you were there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I testified in front of a Judge
Francis Young, very intelligent man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the feeling of the people that I was
working with normal and that it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was going to brush it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to finish our testimony and
50 minutes later he was going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He agonized over this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was only to make a recommendation
to the head of DEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't make the decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he recommended wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had heard people all over the
United States from all different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: illnesses and said in effect for God sakes
help these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of response did he receive?
[SPEAKER_01]: The head of DEA in effect said drop dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're stupid.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I, we only have a couple of minutes
left and I was wondering, you commented
[SPEAKER_00]: that people of an older generation than
what I am have a problem at times being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to rethink, restructure their
thinking on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to say to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were told and I came from an era that
if somebody, if my government told me go
[SPEAKER_01]: out and stand in the middle of the traffic
I'd probably do it because they would
[SPEAKER_01]: never tell me anything that was harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has taken me a long time to realize
this isn't, this is no longer true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it never was but I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so therefore it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, it's like a religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may go away from the religion that you
were brought up as a child but it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh go with your gut feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you're right, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
