[SPEAKER_01]: In the rhyme of match These embers of
torch Sweeting the light What you do to me
[SPEAKER_01]: This temptation of heat Craving your
liquid That deep fire This sweet rushing
[SPEAKER_01]: flame An embracing of stirring Your name
is the spark Fire starting this roar
[SPEAKER_01]: Blazing through my heart Much is said
about love But love seems to change With
[SPEAKER_01]: no way to explain Our wild of gentleness
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality of dreams The closeness of
close Melting destiny and fate What is
[SPEAKER_01]: meant to be An unraveling of need This
drenching of desire And it all started
[SPEAKER_01]: with your smile An embracing of stirring
Your name is the spark Fire starting this
[SPEAKER_00]: roar Blazing through my heart Much is said
about love But love seems to change No way
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain Our wilding of need
[SPEAKER_01]: In the rhyme of match These embers of
torch Sweeting the light What you do to me
[SPEAKER_01]: This temptation of heat Craving your
liquid That sweet fire That deep rushing
[SPEAKER_01]: flame An embracing of stirring Your name
is the spark Fire starting this roar
Blazing through my heart
