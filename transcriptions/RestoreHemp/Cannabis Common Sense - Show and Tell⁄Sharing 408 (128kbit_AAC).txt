[SPEAKER_00]: We have these cannabis extract pills from,
who is the manufacturer of this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Upjohns, they're still around today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're these mini, itty bitty,
teeny tiny pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that they contain one to four
grains of cannabis per itty bitty,
[SPEAKER_00]: teeny tiny pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now somebody would ask you, is that still
any good?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's about 110 years old, so it's no
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this one is about 125.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're five years old, Senza-Persa pills,
and they're coated in this little purple
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see some of them there in
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we have the Neuralgia pills
from Mumford in Philadelphia that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: around anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these guys are Eli Lilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the Bush family owns a lot of
stock in Eli Lilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is back from about 1920 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis extract, what is it,
number 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had about 10 different cannabis
products, including powdered hashish from
[SPEAKER_00]: Eli Lilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if they still have the patent
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was never a patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always was grandfathered in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't patent any of these
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's from Park Davis, and it's also
one of several Park Davis products,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis indica extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we come to two nifty Sharpen Dome,
and they're still around too, Sharpen Dome
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is cannabis from Cannabis
Americana, grown here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is for migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people wonder if cannabis is
useful for migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Sharpen Dome medicine from 1890.
[SPEAKER_00]: Migraine number three, with extract of
cannabis listed right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally we come to a new product
that you can get at your health food
[SPEAKER_00]: store, Manitoba Harvest shelled hemp
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things taste like a cross between
cashews and walnuts or pecans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really good and good for you
with all the omega-3s and all that good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
