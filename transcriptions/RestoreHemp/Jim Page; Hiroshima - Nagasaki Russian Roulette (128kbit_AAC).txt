[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote this song a long time ago,
and it's called Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian
[SPEAKER_00]: Roulette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some rap group collective back in
Connecticut or someplace like that got a
[SPEAKER_00]: hold of it through another channel,
and they rewrote parts of it so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was Hiroshima Fukushima Electric Roulette
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned into a rap song that is so
fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know if you can hear it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up there on the web for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a song that kind of disappears
for a while, and then it becomes relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: again when something happens like Japan,
like the nuclear reactor over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They dropped the bomb in 45 to end the
World War.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one had ever seen such a terrible sight
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world watched with eyes wide to see
where it would lead as the politics of
[SPEAKER_01]: power passed around the seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a time to remember that we never
can forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were playing Hiroshima Nagasaki
Russian Roulette.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rose like the saviors of our modern
human race with radiation halos that hung
[SPEAKER_01]: above their face with a key to the sure
cure and treatment of our ills.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hot shot of cobalt, a pocket full of
pills speaking always of the enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked across the seas while moving in
among us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a carrier disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down deep inside the bunkers of the
concrete and lead, Einstein's disciples
[SPEAKER_01]: working steadily ahead, building heavy
mental power plants to fire the city
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you hear is the underground
humming in the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the walls of tight security circle all
around where they spill out all the poison
[SPEAKER_01]: and they bury it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old up in the harbors, hidden secretly
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The warheads and the submarines await to
make their play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the military masterminds improve on
their designs while the soldiers get all
[SPEAKER_01]: doped up and stumble through the lines and
the leaks in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get carried by the tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it national security.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it attempted home assign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Governors and statesmen on congressional
pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick to please the hand that feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Careful what they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call out experts to assure us and to
wave their magic wands.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the power of the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the future marches on and then they
gather up their favors and political games
[SPEAKER_01]: while the spills fill the rivers and
settle in the plain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the minds behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are riddled full of holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not to be trusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: With their hands at the controls,
their eyesight is twisted with the glory
[SPEAKER_01]: of their careers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heat, praise, and flattery is music to
their ears and to listen to them talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about how it hasn't happened yet stuck
playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima.
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima.
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima.
