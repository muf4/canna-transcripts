[SPEAKER_00]: I'm John Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own Law 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a marijuana law firm founded here in
Portland, Oregon back in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing this for a long time and
we're going to have to keep doing it until
[SPEAKER_00]: it's completely legal like they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to tell everybody is we've
made giant steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of people out there
who are suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people who are still in prison,
people who are still in jail in this state
[SPEAKER_00]: and in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people around who are getting
arrested still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be 18, 19, 20, still get arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be growing more than one plant and
get arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do so many things that will allow
you to get arrested or otherwise have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so until the day comes when community
policing, where the police are your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends again, where the police are trying
to help you, where the police are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you directions rather than see
what's in your pocket, until that day
[SPEAKER_00]: comes, I want you to remember something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those words are very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on my lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on my cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on just about everything I own to
the point that I think I could repeat it
[SPEAKER_00]: in my sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I ask everybody to do,
help yourself out, learn this phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will save you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had clients who say themselves easily
10, 20, $30,000 by just saying these magic
[SPEAKER_00]: words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really are magic words.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Supreme Court of the United States
says they're magic words and they will get
[SPEAKER_00]: the police to leave you alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't and they do violate your
rights, you've got recourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't say these words,
you can be in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want everybody to do is say with
me, am I free to go officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am being detained, I do not consent
to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to speak with my attorney prior
to answering any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are magic words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are magic words.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's important about this is that
the police, they oftentimes can be your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and I don't want to disparage them
because there's a lot of good cops do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of good things and take care of us and
they help us out in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to marijuana,
when it comes to drug use, when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to those sorts of things, the police are
not your friends.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you've got to do is you've got
to stand up and it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if your voice shakes, even if your
body shakes, even if you cry, even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to sit down, when you deal with the
police, you have to assert your rights
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you don't assert your rights,
you're going to end up in a jail cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can end up in a cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take your kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they can ultimately take that for
so many people is so valuable and
[SPEAKER_00]: something I fought for many years for is
your freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched my friends die in cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not hyperbole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out that they're dead from a
letter from the Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anyone here to ever suffer
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anyone here to ever watch
them try to take away their kids because
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoked a joint and they claim that
you're an unfit parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do is I want to live in a
world where marijuana is treated
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately, where there's going to be
some regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're never going to live in the utopia
that I wish we could live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can live in a world where when
you smoke marijuana, it won't destroy your
[SPEAKER_00]: life for a year, five years, 10 years,
20, 30, 40, or end your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the world I want to live in,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
