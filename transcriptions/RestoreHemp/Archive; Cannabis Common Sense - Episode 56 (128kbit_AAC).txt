[SPEAKER_00]: You know we're here to To try and get this
initiative on a ballot to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: debate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some real information This is on a
belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have a real debate Real facts
getting out there something that's missing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now That's when the reason why you
know we found that our our show here
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas common sense is so popular Is that
we're providing common sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know some real answers about this
whole issue, and I'm sure it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our you know what the Portland's
finest watching this show and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I like you folks if you're
watching to stop and think about it You
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's just like you know think about
what you're doing and and why you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: It I mean, it's just it's just hopefully
it's not because you're following orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because you want that next
paycheck Yeah, stop tyranny stop arresting
[SPEAKER_01]: nonviolent marijuana offenders support the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act call us you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell him what octa will do well Yeah,
thanks paul for reminding me octa will
[SPEAKER_00]: Will allow doctors to prescribe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana to patients at cost
through they can then pick up at a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacy you can go to your local you know
rite aid or Walgreens or Fred Meyer any
[SPEAKER_00]: any pharmacy of your choosing and and pick
up your prescription there a lot easier
[SPEAKER_00]: than Trying to find a black market another
thing it'll do it will allow our farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow industrial hemp In which they will
give them Put them in the forefront of the
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging market around the world for
industrial hemp You know cannabis taking
[SPEAKER_00]: off on industrial hemp movement now
Europe's been on it for a few years now
[SPEAKER_00]: The US has fallen behind in this new
emerging market It's like if say 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago the US said banned computers here the
rest of the world would have leaped ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: with computers and we'd be sitting here
doing nothing and And it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't you know and a good analogy
because right now our farmers are falling
[SPEAKER_01]: farther and farther behind Canada this
year has Allowed the first commercial hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: crop yeah, so in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's subsidized more than any other crop
Yeah, because they realized the benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: Of it which we can get into a little bit
later But the other main aspect of our
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative which would do would be allow
sale to adults So I'll sell marijuana to
[SPEAKER_00]: adults through state run stores i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: the liquor store system or in Bars and
clubs the bars and clubs would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell alcohol right, but they'd be licensed
and run just like a the bars are today You
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know so it's Regulated so you
know people know what's going on and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that way no minors can't have access And
then of course that would that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: that aspect would be taxed directly No
adult recreational sales would be taxed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that would raise more money
than the lottery We really can't quantify
[SPEAKER_01]: it Officially well and then also too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean people are thinking more and more
about You know the lottery is not such a
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing I mean there was a proposed
initiative this year about banning lottery
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Oregon But they backed off for a
while I think partly because they realized
[SPEAKER_00]: there wasn't a replacement revenue But
something like this could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement revenue for a lottery a lot of
people don't like the lottery because
[SPEAKER_00]: especially video poker a lot of people get
addicted to that so easily and then there
[SPEAKER_00]: goes our whole paycheck and and so this
could be the way you know this could be
[SPEAKER_01]: the answer and We are going to raise a lot
of money when we regulate marijuana Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: if Oregon's the first state to regulate
the sale of marijuana to adults Then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to put our industries at the
forefront of an exciting new industry
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to Just make lots and lots of
money their farmers are going to be happy
[SPEAKER_01]: the tourism industry is going to be happy
the liquor store owners are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: happy the bars and coffee shops that get a
license and Don't let miners in they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be happy well and all the small
little crafters out there who can take
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp products and make them
into clothes clothing you know with
[SPEAKER_00]: different fiber make it into food Make it
into oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things they can do and
you know I think that we'll have a much
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier population here because of the
medicinal use you know being you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: because it'll be up to a doctor and a
patient for what it's prescribed for you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's not a checkoff list saying
okay This is what only way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe only things you can prescribe
marijuana for in this list here You know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like now it's up to the doctor and up
to the patient because we know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know medical science You know they're
discovering new things every single day
[SPEAKER_00]: And so who's to say that tomorrow they
might find another good use medical use
[SPEAKER_00]: for for cannabis It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there are several different
compounds in Cannabis or marijuana that
[SPEAKER_01]: have medicinal benefits a lot of people
talk about THC or Tetrahydrocannabinol and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's useful for lowering nausea however
if You're pretty nauseous might be hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep that pill down There are other things
though that THC Doesn't treat but that
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana does and that's because it has
other compounds that are medicinally
[SPEAKER_01]: effective one of them is Cannabidiol or
CBD and that controls muscle spasms and
[SPEAKER_01]: Has an analgesic effect then there's CBC
and Cannabichromine and that is an
[SPEAKER_01]: antibiotic and Has some other medicinal
properties those drugs aren't available by
[SPEAKER_01]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not synthesized and sold
Pharmaceutically the way that marijuana is
[SPEAKER_01]: so we want our farmers and industries to
have access to just those items so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can Raise lots and lots of money you
know yeah, I think it's you know it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a fascinating thing and you know one thing
I want to talk about is how just oh very
[SPEAKER_00]: recently in Washington County For the
first time that I'm aware of an attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to raise the choice of evils
defense in a case of a patient Multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: Sclerosis patient who was found growing
some plants You know this patient said
[SPEAKER_00]: that He tried you know you know buying on
a street in a black market, but that was
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and it was scary You know he
didn't like having to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know down to Portland here when the
cannabis Buyers club was operating You
[SPEAKER_00]: know he didn't like that whole scene and
so he just will you know grew a few plants
[SPEAKER_00]: at his home there Because it helped him
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he helped much medicine multiple
sclerosis I've seen multiple sclerosis
[SPEAKER_01]: patients use marijuana I've seen them
blocked in a spasm where they're almost
[SPEAKER_01]: convulsive and Taking they couldn't
swallow a pill and keep it down and wait
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour for it to take effect But a puff
or two of marijuana helps yeah what you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and that's what this gentleman said
and he was able to They brought in a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor who testified that yes,
you've seen you know it work and document
[SPEAKER_00]: a case he had documented a scientific
study of this patient MS elsewhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked and they Although the jury still
convicted this person I think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: victory the fact that the media reported
the fact that there was a choice of egos
[SPEAKER_00]: defense and a medical doctor testifying as
an expert that the fact that Marijuana is
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I you know think it's a great
victory You know overall for the movement,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's you know defeat for the
individual right you know this individual
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I hope that You know that they
don't sentence him too harshly He said he
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to be a poster boy for the
legalization of marijuana movement But he
[SPEAKER_01]: was willing to accept that role because he
shoved upon him well We're we don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: to shove this role of a convicted felon
this role of Deviance on any more people
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, especially a you know a patient a
medical user somebody who has You know a
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible disease condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's called disease or
condition, but somebody who has this I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, it's just I mean people have this
you know it's just horrible to have and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and I think anybody who knows an
MS patient realize that they definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: have great benefits from using marijuana
medicinally and So once again folks give
[SPEAKER_00]: us a call so we can get this initiative on
the ballot and So allowed doctors and
[SPEAKER_00]: patients to have freedom to choose and
freedom of privacy what to prescribe five
[SPEAKER_00]: oh three two three five four six oh six

There's more That people can do so call us
[SPEAKER_00]: two three five four six oh six yeah and
Getting back to our discussion on the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal use of marijuana you know
there's a an increasing oh Dialogue going
[SPEAKER_00]: on right now among cannabis activists
cannabis users about the fact that People
[SPEAKER_00]: are saying more and more that all use of
cannabis is medicinal that we shouldn't Be
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid to state that that the fact that
everybody uses it to Whether it's to relax
[SPEAKER_00]: and unwind that's like medicine I mean
like some people take an aspirin to help
[SPEAKER_00]: them relax after you know a little
headache for hard day of running or you
[SPEAKER_00]: got through your muscles are tight or
playing tennis whatever or some people
[SPEAKER_00]: relax with a You know alcohol and and to
that that's medicine you know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that anything that changes your state of
mind is medicine according to some
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions and You know people say we
shouldn't be afraid of that to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: all use is medicinal And then it should be
up to the to the user to decide how they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to medicate themselves Exactly and in
a lot of cases people are medicating
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves medicinally For a variety of
different things that aren't recognized
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally in science like depression
I've known people who have depression
[SPEAKER_01]: who've given up very dangerous Drugs and
just use marijuana and find that it
[SPEAKER_01]: controls their depression better than the
very dangerous drugs do Yeah, I mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just you know I mean I'd say I think it's
just an interesting dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to happen among Some people
who are who are just have the checklist
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality of you know marijuana is only
good for these these specified things and
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you try and say it's good for
anything else why then you're just You
[SPEAKER_00]: know harming the cause and and I don't
know I'm still learning myself on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm tend to think that more and more
You know all use of cannabis is medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that dialogues really taking place
in California Which is in total at the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront these days of of medical
marijuana and the attacks by the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government and the California Attorney
General and You were mentioning earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: today about the would you happen down
there with Dennis Perrone exactly Dennis
[SPEAKER_01]: Perrone was one of the people who?
[SPEAKER_01]: came up with the concept of Pushing for
medical marijuana politically through the
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative process he passed an initiative
in the city of San Francisco back in back
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like 77 that Got 70% of the
vote the highest plurality in any Election
[SPEAKER_01]: ever in San Francisco for medical
marijuana passed another citywide San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco proposition to Deemphasize and
defund all marijuana enforcement by the
[SPEAKER_01]: city of San Francisco Then back in 95 and
96 he organized a statewide medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana petition known as the
compassionate use California's for
[SPEAKER_01]: compassionate use and that passed and it's
Caused the federal government a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: heartaches headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say and a good thing too because
it's brought the debate to the forefront
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is I mean it's it makes the
federal government look like hypocrites if
[SPEAKER_00]: they take medicine away from people you
know in a state where California said
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is medicine then here's the
government coming in taking away people's
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine I mean you know it just bad PR.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they you know they Still don't
know how to deal with it yet They've
[SPEAKER_00]: raided some of clubs down there,
and then Dennis Perrone had to close his
[SPEAKER_01]: club Yeah, he said and admitted that he
had helped supply marijuana to other clubs
[SPEAKER_01]: and that wasn't specifically written into
his initiative and so the judge
[SPEAKER_01]: reluctantly said signed an order to close
the club, but the police chief and the
[SPEAKER_01]: district attorney in San Francisco
Hallinan and the mayor Willie Brown all
[SPEAKER_01]: said that they support the club and the
next day it reopened and hazel Rogers took
[SPEAKER_01]: over the Cannabis Buyers Club in San
Francisco the largest in the nation and
[SPEAKER_01]: she's a 72 year old grandmother and the
city endorses her running the club and the
[SPEAKER_01]: State government and the feds tried to
close it down in a subsequent injunction,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the judge wouldn't issue the
injunction so that's where it stands as of
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're taping Exactly and then you
know part of it was the fact that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying to other clubs But also he was
also He's a firm believer that all use is
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal exactly and you might say he's
He as far as I know he came up with that
[SPEAKER_00]: concept Yeah, I mean I and and that's he
was the one that's you know brought to the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront You know even for the you know
for the checklist mentality folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's two two camps in
California people for medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: There's you know Dennis Perrone and other
people saying that's like whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor and a patient want and then there's
the checklist folks that saying it's only
[SPEAKER_00]: for only for these things and the the
checklist folks Had a lot of money still
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of money, but they're losing
the you know the public Opinions not on
[SPEAKER_00]: their side a public opinion in California
saying it's like what's the big deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's up to the individual you
know and and we're in their doctor you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Our initiative goes just a little bit
farther than that we implement the
[SPEAKER_01]: production of marijuana According to the
guidelines of international treaty now the
[SPEAKER_01]: courts have ruled that international
treaties have the same weight as the
[SPEAKER_01]: Constitution so we complied with the
Conditions set by the single Convention
[SPEAKER_01]: treaty in the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act we
use their specific Controls in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: the licensing requirements Requirements
under the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and of course now that there's a
movement of front a foot in United Nations
[SPEAKER_00]: to change that you know single Convention
to make it stronger because they realize
[SPEAKER_00]: people like us and people around the world
are starting to say hey You know this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to regulate it to get it back from you
know the underground and And a black
[SPEAKER_00]: market bring it above ground so exactly we
pioneered that so there's you know there's
[SPEAKER_00]: movement afoot to tighten it all up and So
it's real interesting you know I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's you know folks over in Europe
right now being really strong keeping an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye on that Because they've got a strong
movement over there and a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a big march in London recently So
that's you know and didn't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: publicity here in us of course you know it
was a major major march and protest in
[SPEAKER_00]: London and about freeing cannabis and
right but you know if they're trying to to
[SPEAKER_01]: strengthen the treaties to stop our
ability to do it we better Strike now
[SPEAKER_01]: while the iron is heart hot we better
seize the day Carpe Diem call us at two
[SPEAKER_01]: three five four six oh six because you
need to get involved to stop the war on
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs as I've often said and Paul might be
getting tired and you too hearing the war
[SPEAKER_01]: on drugs I firmly believe is the issue on
which the future of freedom in America
[SPEAKER_01]: hinges Help us protect freedom help us
restore him call two three five Four six
[SPEAKER_00]: oh six yeah, the war on drugs is a way for
the powers that be the ruling class the
[SPEAKER_00]: owning class We're gonna call them to
control the rest of us to control Probably
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of us that you know don't own
everything in the world You know that
[SPEAKER_00]: those of us that just want to live you
know and in a society of tolerance and
[SPEAKER_00]: openness And you know they don't want that
because they make their profits off of
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling folks so give us a call or

hold down a job you pay your taxes and you
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that it's not a big deal it's not
the the big fear that the government is is
[SPEAKER_00]: telling us you know you've got folks out
there like Gordon Smith Senator Gordon
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith hiding behind children well the
county sheriff Dan Noelle hiding behind
[SPEAKER_00]: children saying that oh we've got to like
take away your rights we can protect
[SPEAKER_00]: children it's like that's not true if they
really want to protect children using that
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality they would take away alcohol and
prescription drugs and more people die
[SPEAKER_00]: from you know wrong use of prescription
drugs every year then all illegal drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: combined so people die from script yeah so
they wouldn't give out any prescription
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs with that with that kind of
mentality and I don't know why they're you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it just because they realize they
can't win the argument on on logic or
[SPEAKER_00]: reason they have to hide behind children
and it's sad you know grown men and women
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding behind children they can't even
stay in on their own ideas yeah just last
[SPEAKER_01]: month Paul and I held a news conference to
counter Senator Gordon Smith and Sheriff
[SPEAKER_01]: Noel when they said that we have to stop
marijuana in fact Sheriff Noly said I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: him on this news conference that we were
we opposed him in the TV thing he said
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you get a marijuana petition
shoved in your face don't sign it well
[SPEAKER_01]: Sheriff Noly we don't shove petitions in
people's face I've never shoved anything
[SPEAKER_01]: in anybody's face I don't like the
implication I don't like you coming and
[SPEAKER_01]: arresting our fellow citizens for
marijuana and we're gonna stop you buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: so call us and help us stop this crazy
sheriff call us at two three five four six
[SPEAKER_00]: oh six yeah I mean you know we've got to
send Sheriff Noel a message and yeah look
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so you know when it's coming up
you know in the fall you know he'll be on
[SPEAKER_00]: a ballot you know write somebody else's
name in there's a guy named Slider who's
[SPEAKER_01]: running and I don't know if he's good or
bad but he's got to be better than this
[SPEAKER_00]: cloud well no that's but then you know
Slider's history though because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the fall ballot now oh so I

[SPEAKER_00]: so Noel doesn't you know walk in in the
landslide and you know and we got to send
[SPEAKER_00]: those all those folks a message you know
Vera Katz you know and all the city
[SPEAKER_00]: commissioners she's not running this year
well we've got some of the message yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: because she'll be out there you know
hiding behind kids herself you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can't win this they can't win
the argument on ideas or reason it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly the emotion of children and you
know the right message to children is
[SPEAKER_00]: think for yourself I mean that's how you
know anybody you know who has been brought
[SPEAKER_00]: up in a in a normal way realizes that you
know you tell your kids to think for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself you know because a parent can't
be there behind him 24 hours a day and so
