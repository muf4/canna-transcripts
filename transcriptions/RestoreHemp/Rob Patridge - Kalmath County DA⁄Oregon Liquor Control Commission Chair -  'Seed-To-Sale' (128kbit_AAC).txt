[SPEAKER_00]: federal considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, you know, federal considerations
related to this, and you're all aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, and the OLCC is very aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana remains illegal under federal
law, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's a business risk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we just point that out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, on August 29, 2013, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice issued guidance to
the states that have legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They issued guidance under what is called
the Cole Memorandum.
[SPEAKER_00]: C-O-L-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the Cole Memorandum provides the
guidance to states that are putting
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cole Memorandum doesn't have the force
of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's merely an opinion of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney's Office under the current
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Administration to administration could
change that, so it doesn't have the force
[SPEAKER_00]: of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to look at the Cole
Memorandum in its original form,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to marijuana.oregon.gov, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the main points of the Cole
Memorandum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the main points of the Cole Memorandum
are to one, prevent the distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana to minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, prevent revenue from the sale of
marijuana from going to criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprises, gangs, and cartels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, prevent the diversion of marijuana
from where it is legal under state law to
[SPEAKER_00]: other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we don't want it going out of state,
no under state commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, prevent state authorized activity
from being used as a cover for illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be growing things in the
recreational market and then, la la la,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden, they're all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's what they don't want to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, prevent violence and the use of
firearms and the cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, prevent drug driving and other
adverse public health consequences
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, prevent the growing of marijuana on
public lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eight, prevent marijuana use on public
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the eight kind of principle
points of what the Cole Memorandum says,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, go to marijuana.oregon.gov to
take a look at the original by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to meet the precepts of those
eight points from the Cole Memorandum,
[SPEAKER_00]: both Colorado and Washington and the state
of Oregon is now looking at right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the process of preparing a request for
proposal for a seed to sale tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't feel that we can comply with
federal law without having a seed to sale
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I already said Colorado and Washington
require it, and the reason they require it
[SPEAKER_00]: is so the taxes are properly collected and
that the inventory does not migrate from
[SPEAKER_00]: the residential market into a public
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's the reason we have the seed to
sale tracking system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's designed for more effective audits
and to satisfy federal guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also for efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have people going to every
recreational marijuana grow and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, individually counting every
single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have a fleet of auditors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to go through and with
the one with RFID tags and be able to say
[SPEAKER_00]: how many plants are here and what's going
on and are they properly where they're
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for efficiency not only for us but
for the operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they do in a lot of the
manufacturing industries today.
