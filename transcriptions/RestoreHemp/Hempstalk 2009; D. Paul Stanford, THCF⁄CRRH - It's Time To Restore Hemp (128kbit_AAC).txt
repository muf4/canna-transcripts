[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up, show your love for Paul
Steele!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks to all of you for coming out
to make this a big success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in our clinics around the
country, so far we've helped almost
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 people become legal medical
marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done that in nine states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at expanding into other
states too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, medical marijuana is a
wonderful thing, especially for the really
[SPEAKER_00]: sick people who desperately need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely relieves so many different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeing the patients come to our clinic
is really a spiritually gratifying thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all so grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they help us put this whole festival
on and help expand the movement a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But medical marijuana is not the end,
and it's not the end of the trail for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need, you know, the hip produces more
fiber, more protein, and more oil than any
[SPEAKER_00]: other plant on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've got to do is legalize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the worst thing about the current
situation is thousands of families are
[SPEAKER_00]: broken up, parents are thrown in jail,
kids are put into foster homes all over
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, you know, it doesn't cause the
terrible things that alcohol can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: when someone is abusing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a marijuana abuser would be
somebody who smokes it all the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's definitely not harming many
people except for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we should have the freedom
to grow the plant that produces more
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber, protein, and oil than any other
plant on this planet and solve a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a proposal to do that right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of proposals that we just
gathered signatures on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get a ballot title from the
Secretary of State.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process here in Oregon now is you need
to get a thousand signatures to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ballot title is what actually
appears on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to poll two different versions
of our Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on which one gets the best
in the polls, we're going to move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: with a bill for 2010 to completely
legalize marijuana and end adult marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, allow any individual to grow
their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, we had filed a previous bill
that would have put marijuana in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: stores as alcohol or liquor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our previous polling, we showed that
was a real mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to keep marijuana separate from
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're putting marijuana in
marijuana only stores now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't go to the same store to get
your alcohol and your marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would also allow people to open
like coffee shops or marijuana bars or
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will just really make our economy
buffer tourism in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need your support to make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the coming months, you'll see a new
petition probably around Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just we urge you to get people to sign
that petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to have to win the
election.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, we're going to poll and see
where we stand in terms of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: different wordings we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we appreciate all of you folks
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, support all the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help us put this event on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up a little bit of trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to leave this park nicer than we
additionally found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And register to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most important things
you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get rid of the stereotype
that we're just lazy stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got to get out there and show
that we can take charge of the political
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 60s, Tim Leary said turn on
tune in and drop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he changed his tune in the latter
part of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked what he was saying
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was turn on, tune in, and take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we've got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to do that is through the
ballot box in this society currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I urge you to register to vote,
partake in the political process,
[SPEAKER_00]: and enjoy human and the human revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Los Barruanos,
thank John Trudeau, thank human,
[SPEAKER_00]: and thank each and every one of you for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, help us restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stanford, everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you.
