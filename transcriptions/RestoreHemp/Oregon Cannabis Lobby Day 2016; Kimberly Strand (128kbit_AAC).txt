[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Kimberly Strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a patient, a grower for patients,
and I also own the cannabis lodge here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Willamette Valley called PGN Lodge in
the 420 Lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say to you that over the years
we've been in Salem for six years with not
[SPEAKER_00]: one altercation, not one problem,
never a DUI, not even a noise violation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis patients are locally local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis patients have a garden,
community garden where our neighbors can
[SPEAKER_00]: come and take the food they need during
the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have coat drives and food drives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've cleaned up the building that was
abandoned for almost a year by the Eagles
[SPEAKER_00]: and have made it a beautiful place for
people to come and gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to say that the Clean Air
Act, that you're not allowed to come and
[SPEAKER_00]: gather with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you that medical marijuana
patients do not medicate in 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: like a cigarette smoker does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say to a terminally ill person
or person with body pains and aches that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry now you have to go outside and
it's 42 degrees and it's raining and we
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to power smoke down your joint so
that you don't hurt anymore, I gotta say
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry we're just not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding a daily open act of civil
disobedience at PGN because honestly we
[SPEAKER_00]: got an outdoor smoking area and that's
where the cigarette smokers go and I say
[SPEAKER_00]: to them don't let the door hit you on the
way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also tell them if you want to quit
smoking I'll give you a quarter ounce a
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, a roller, a pack of papers and every
time you want to smoke that cigarette you
[SPEAKER_00]: sit down and you roll that joint and then
you smoke that cigarette all by yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and guess what I have 12 to 16 people
every year quit smoking cigarettes on my
[SPEAKER_00]: roll a joint program for the last six
years at PGN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say to me I want you to go
outside in the cold because we're worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about your secondhand smoke I'm gonna say
we're not gonna participate in that
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you when you say we're gonna
go outside they're not gonna let you back
[SPEAKER_00]: in just know it they're not gonna let you
back in once you give in don't give up we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a beautiful outdoor smoking area we
do and it will continue to be for
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarette smokers at the lodge as long as
possible and I know I'm probably putting
[SPEAKER_00]: myself in jeopardy because it is a
complaint-based program at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: however if you let them push you outside
and push you back in the closet that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where you'll be we fought long and hard so
that patients of dispensaries would have
[SPEAKER_00]: the right to medicate how many of them
can't work a four-hour shift without
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a 10-minute break to medicate and
now they got it you want them to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: home medicate and drive back no no also
the targeting of our elderly cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patients for DUI I happen to have a
patient who got a DUI for a rolling stop
[SPEAKER_00]: at a stop sign because she mistakenly
showed that officer the utensil that she
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked her medicine out of and he arrested
her right there on the spot she didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: a ticket for a rolling stop she got a
ticket because she had a bong in the front
[SPEAKER_00]: seat of her car within the driver's reach
she got a DUI she's 72 years old she spent
[SPEAKER_00]: the night in jail in Dallas is not a
friendly place I'll just tell you you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to get get a DUI for marijuana
in Dallas they don't think she was not
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with respect she was not treated
with dignity and now she's in their system
[SPEAKER_00]: and being told that she can't even
medicate for 18 months while she's on
[SPEAKER_00]: parole or probation or whatever this class
she's taken that's her medicine and she's
[SPEAKER_00]: being denied this is wrong on so many
levels when you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion and caring and helping people
they don't know they really don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have a clue you have 12 people
making the rules for 78,000 amazing people
[SPEAKER_00]: who need this medicine and unfortunately
we can't get them here they're sick it's
[SPEAKER_00]: too cold for a lot of my patients to be
outside they couldn't stand here for these
[SPEAKER_00]: two hours so bless you I know many of you
are in a lot of pain standing out there to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to us beat it out there that we
need your help we're not going to be put
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the closet again we're not going
to be ashamed that we are cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patients this plant I've seen it do so
much for so many people including my own
[SPEAKER_00]: my own life my dad was a police officer he
got the Purple Heart from the city of
[SPEAKER_00]: Salem 79 years old he wants to rub my bomb
on his feet so he goes to his doctor and
[SPEAKER_00]: he says doc I just got to be legal I don't
want to smoke it but my daughter makes
[SPEAKER_00]: this bomb and I want to rub it on my feet
my feet hurt so bad and they said Jerry
[SPEAKER_00]: just take this medicine just take this
medicine for three months then a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks my dad had all the symptoms of
Alzheimer's he went to Walmart forgot
[SPEAKER_00]: where he was and he wet his pants in
Walmart and I had to retrieve him so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're approaching 80 years old they want
to dope you and drug you and roll you into
[SPEAKER_00]: the hallway so they can clean your beds
and do you not be a bother to them I got
[SPEAKER_00]: my dad off that medicine and within a week
he had full cognitive he now lives in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida he's 86 looking at girls in
g-strings okay this is how you should grow
[SPEAKER_00]: old happy with pain relief that you choose
quality is what it's about amen it is
[SPEAKER_00]: about quality of life and by God we live
in Oregon and we should have the right to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose our medicine all right how we live
how we chewed our medicine and how we die

you all
