[SPEAKER_01]: No compromises either It is what it is So
Mary we really appreciate you all being
[SPEAKER_01]: here and In
[SPEAKER_01]: between the blues In between the blues
there are good days and bad days with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and nothing to lose While the
setting sun never sits and the night has
[SPEAKER_01]: no limits The void between freedom and
free Dealing with the unnatural reality We
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be, a need to see Grass fire,
my DNA needs THC Grass fire in a world
[SPEAKER_00]: that year That's the way this fire burns
It's a grass fire In the unnatural society
[SPEAKER_01]: Been trying to maintain While the same
appear to be Clearly insane With no way to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain Outlasting the great law A
sparking spark does my mind Grass fire
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling the sky Breathing in Sativa's
design
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass fire in a world that year That's the
way this fire burns It's a grass fire The
[SPEAKER_01]: void between freedom and free Dealing with
the unnatural reality We need to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: a need to see Grass fire, my DNA needs THC
Dreaming of long times gone And all that
[SPEAKER_01]: those times brought Looking to the heart
of tomorrow Grass fire in a world that
[SPEAKER_01]: year That's the way this fire burns Oh,
I like grass fire Grass fire Oh,
I like
grass fire Oh, I like grass fire
