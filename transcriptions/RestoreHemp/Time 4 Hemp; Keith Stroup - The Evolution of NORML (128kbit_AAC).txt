[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining us today on the program is the
executive director of the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may know him as somebody in a
different capacity, the founder of NORML,
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith Stropp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop, Stropp?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you said it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith Stropp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you started NORML, is the impression
I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the founder of NORML.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that all get started?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that come about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was coming out of law school,
and I graduated in 1968, if you remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the height of the anti-war
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a lot of law students,
I'd first been introduced to marijuana as
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the anti-war movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, if you smoked a marijuana
cigarette, you were making as much a
[SPEAKER_01]: political statement as you were enjoying a
recreational drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were essentially thumbing your nose at
the establishment that had gotten us into
[SPEAKER_01]: the quagmire of Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what began to happen were a lot of
friends began to be busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally, the first few months I was
out of law school, I had two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: friends come to me who had been stopped
because they either had long hair and got
[SPEAKER_01]: the attention of the police or drove a van
or there were all kinds of peace signs on
[SPEAKER_01]: their bumper or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they'd pull them over,
of course, they'd find a joint under the
[SPEAKER_01]: seat or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a young lawyer trying to figure out
how to help these folks, I had also just
[SPEAKER_01]: spent two years working on a group called
the National Commission on Product Safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my way to stay out of Vietnam,
to be real honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to get a critical skills
deferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to avoid having to go to the war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was about 10 days away from having
to ship out when I got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spent two years working closely with
Ralph Nader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was impressed by the techniques he
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed to us that instead of trying
to deal with individuals one by one who
[SPEAKER_01]: were being arrested for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, by the way,
the arrest rates were about, I think about
[SPEAKER_01]: 650,000 people a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over 90% of those were for simple
possession of an ounce or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were going to jail for long
periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in states like Texas,
but actually all over the country they
[SPEAKER_01]: were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought if we could start an
organization that approached the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: the way Nader did on a lot of his issues
with a consumer perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to focus on the unfairness of treating
otherwise law abiding citizens who weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: threatening in any way at all as criminals
simply because they prefer to smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana cigarette rather than drink
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there was a good bit of appeal to
that if you made that case effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normal really was a concept that we set
down thought up and put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you took that concept and you
made that grow nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well there certainly had been people with
similar ideas before.
[SPEAKER_01]: There had been small groups springing up
in different parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had trouble getting good funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was obviously not a very popular issue
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking now 68, 69, and 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were perceived as being radical and
certainly out of the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to get some pretty good funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to get Playboy Foundation behind
the project early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heffner would give us space in the
magazine to focus on victims where if we
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to go in and get someone out of
jail or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over a period of a couple of years we
did a lot of traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd go to Texas where the situation was
probably the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd take journalists through the
Texas prison system for example because we
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted them to meet these people who were
being locked up and to see who these
[SPEAKER_01]: victims really were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the process of that the name normal
obviously got some currency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it began to be recognized by at least
a minority of the folks in the country as
[SPEAKER_01]: the public interest group working on
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major step forward in solidifying the
country under one banner had to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: amorphia on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fascinating group that Gordon
Brownell and Michael Aldridge and there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a third person who had put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a legalization group and they
raised their funds by selling rolling
[SPEAKER_01]: papers made from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you keep in mind cannabis is what
it's used in Canadian currency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used in a lot of things but it was
nonetheless it was an interesting idea
[SPEAKER_01]: because you could in theory raise your
money from your own constituents to fund
[SPEAKER_01]: the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem was back then it was similar
to I think the political situation today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were perceived as being pro pot of
trying to turn on the world you really
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't get access to legislatures and
you wouldn't get access to the major
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always said we didn't encourage the
use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we recognized that for millions of
people who made the choice to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: that's their choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the right to privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So amorphia had trouble continuing making
their project work because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: perceived as a little bit over the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to know them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing very good work on the West
Coast and we were doing good work in most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we merged amorphia with normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened up a West Coast office.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of their people ran it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of their people came back and helped
me run the East Coast office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from about 1973 on I think most of
the serious work on marijuana law reform
[SPEAKER_01]: was done under the banner of normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I was first hearing about normal
back in the 70s I'm from Indiana and news
[SPEAKER_00]: travels a little slower usually two or
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from southern Illinois so I know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were always under the impression that
if you got busted for anything whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a joint, a bag, no matter where you
were at in the United States if you got
[SPEAKER_00]: into a spot call normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there at your side and they'll
fight for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well and I think we pretty well did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm sure there were cases where the
help we offer them may not have been as
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehensive as one would like to offer
but we had a lot of calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also had a lot of young lawyers
like myself but spread all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: country who were getting out of law school
about 67, 68, 69.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd been radicalized by the anti-war
movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They began to get active in other social
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was feasible back then that when
those phone calls came into my office in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington I could pick up the phone and I
had lists of half a dozen or more
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated active lawyers in almost every
state that would at no cost drive across
[SPEAKER_01]: the state or whatever, get a bail hearing,
get this poor kid out of jail,
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out if they could negotiate
something or if not represent him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of those times for no fee at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really dedicated lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that was an accurate perception
of a lot of our activity in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again keep in mind that we were,
we had to help people because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: the guts of the issue was about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also had to make sure the rest of
America who didn't smoke marijuana got to
[SPEAKER_01]: know some of these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way we did it was we would go help
them and then we would, with their
[SPEAKER_01]: permission, publicize the case both in the
local media and sometimes in the national
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did that start to change?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that people now sometimes when they
ring up normal they have difficulties in
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I can exactly follow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you I was with normal from when
we started at 1970 and I left in mid-1979.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ran it for about the first 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their political side I think atrophied
during the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have an active legal committee
but it's a legal committee that mainly
[SPEAKER_01]: holds CLE programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words they train other lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do some very good work and they
have some of the finest lawyers in the
[SPEAKER_01]: country that still are active on that
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the political climate of the
country began to get more conservative I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say the parents group started making
a big impact, anti-drug impact in the late
[SPEAKER_01]: 70s and then they really took hold in the
early 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normal got positioned somehow to where
they were no longer allowed to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a legislative hearing in
Congress or in one of the states during
[SPEAKER_01]: the 70s they wouldn't have thought about
having a hearing without inviting us to
[SPEAKER_01]: have at least one spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact the majority of the hearings
that were held we put on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a traveling road show of
psychiatrists and pediatricians and
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Whipple, a wonderful pediatrician in
her 80s, Zinbergen, Weill, at Harvard,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ungerleiter at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some world recognized
psychopharmacologists and others who were
[SPEAKER_01]: willing and we would raise the money to do
this but we would line up three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: states and set up state legislative
hearings and take these people state to
[SPEAKER_01]: state so they could hear from the real
experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime in the early 80s they quit
allowing normal to participate and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: defined once again or the organization was
as being too radical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think normal had changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the country had changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had gone this direction.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that our laws have gotten a
little different over the past several
[SPEAKER_00]: years and we hope to cover some of these
aspects in your opinions if they've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: worse or better when we come back after
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to our discussion with Keith
Straub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith, do you think that the laws have
gotten worse or better?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways they've gotten and we know
that we got the medical taken care of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in San Francisco and so that is
positive but on the overall do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gotten worse or better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it shows one's age to be able to put
it in perspective but I will tell you that
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've been at this for a while or if
someone's been focusing and interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: the drug issue for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the late 60s it was the first war on
drugs was announced by the president and
[SPEAKER_01]: they passed a major anti-crime bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was in 1969 that in fact
included a provision introduced by then
[SPEAKER_01]: Congressman Ed Koch who of course
subsequently was the mayor of New York for
[SPEAKER_01]: many years to require him to set up
something called the Commission on
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana and Drug Abuse and it sort of
went unnoticed by the DEA and the
[SPEAKER_01]: government agencies that thought they were
getting through this first anti-drug bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll connect back up with that in a
second but in answer to your question the
[SPEAKER_01]: laws at that time were very tough indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example in 1970 and 71 in the state of
Texas they had over I'm trying to spend a
[SPEAKER_01]: while since I've thought about these
figures but they had over a hundred people
[SPEAKER_01]: locked up for life sentences for
possession of an ounce or less of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life sentences?
[SPEAKER_01]: For life sentences.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had something like 600 people serving
more than 30-year terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were pockets of the country where
the laws were as outrageous then as they
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the worst place today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the major change has been that
people are more aware of the tough laws
[SPEAKER_01]: now because they tend to be federalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress every year tries to outdo what
they did the year before and they pass
[SPEAKER_01]: more minimum mandatories and they pass
more death penalty categories where people
[SPEAKER_01]: can be put to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no impact of course on crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no impact on drug use but it
somehow it's a demagoguery experience that
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians find works for them so they
keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things are I would say about as bad now
as they've ever been because you've now
[SPEAKER_01]: had all of the Reagan era and two years of
the Bush era where they're trying to outdo
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and show how against drugs they
are by locking up more and more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say this I don't think it's any
worse today than it was in the late 60s
[SPEAKER_01]: early 70s and in particular I don't think
the climate overall is any worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to remember we were coming out of
the reefer madness era and we hadn't moved
[SPEAKER_01]: very far beyond that by the late 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were still people that thought if
you smoke marijuana it was addictive or it
[SPEAKER_01]: made you commit violent crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean things that now seem kind of like
children might talk about but nobody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: educated would discuss those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were perceived as being accurate in
the late 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I see is a cyclical movement where
interestingly there was a book by David
[SPEAKER_01]: Musto a professor of history at Yale
University that he used to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: testifying for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about the history of narcotics
legislation generally and it tends to go
[SPEAKER_01]: in say decade long jumps where you'll go
for a decade and the country will be
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat permissive especially if the
economy is doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to be a little bit more willing to
let our neighbor do what they want as long
[SPEAKER_01]: as they don't bother us and so you get in
a period where as we were in the early 70s
[SPEAKER_01]: up through the really the late 70s where
the country essentially said we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really care if you smoke marijuana don't
flaunt it in our face but we shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: lock up lucky people up in jail with real
criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point then the pendulum starts
swinging back and clearly for the last 12
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 years it has been going in a more
conservative direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that too will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose what I want people to
understand is it is often during the times
[SPEAKER_01]: of the worst repression or oppression that
political activists and public interest
[SPEAKER_01]: associations do their most creative and
most valuable work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our best work at normal I honestly believe
was during the early and mid 70s when it
[SPEAKER_01]: was tough out there and there was a threat
of being arrested at every stop and the
[SPEAKER_01]: police were they didn't even want us
coming into town.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started making progress and
started being more acceptable and then
[SPEAKER_01]: when Jimmy Carter became president etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: it was difficult to know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't used to being in sighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suspect what you're going to
see is as bad as things are today three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four years from now I think we will look
back and feel very good about the progress
[SPEAKER_01]: and unexpected progress in a lot of cases
that are going to be made in the next few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's a hopeless situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many people out there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you commented earlier in our
discussion that you worked in association
[SPEAKER_00]: with Ralph Nader now that must have been
interesting and beneficial to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing in normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I think he's the ultimate public
interest lawyer and probably the role
[SPEAKER_01]: model for hundreds and hundreds of people
who came along after him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky in that when I was hired at
this commission on product safety they
[SPEAKER_01]: hired four young lawyers right out of law
school and our immediate boss was a lawyer
[SPEAKER_01]: from Harvard who had been Ralph Nader's
roommate in law school and when Nader
[SPEAKER_01]: first came and set up his first public
interest group in Washington this man had
[SPEAKER_01]: been his executive director.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gave me a chance to study at the
feet of people who I consider to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: masters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they probably defined the whole
field of public interest law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now do you see the hemp movement taking a
major effect into the economy soon and if
[SPEAKER_00]: so on a national scale or is it a global
outside of America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I've been fascinated by the attention
paid in the last year or two finally to
[SPEAKER_01]: arguments that had sometimes been made
earlier but apparently didn't catch on for
[SPEAKER_01]: some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I saw is during the 70s we focused on
getting kids out of jail or people out of
[SPEAKER_01]: jail for smoking grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seemed to be the area that needed the
attention and also the area that people
[SPEAKER_01]: were willing to reconsider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they are overreacting to this whole
question of whether somebody smokes a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical issue began to come along in
the mid 70s when I remember when Bob
[SPEAKER_01]: Randall first walked in my office and said
I'm a glaucoma patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smoke marijuana my vision clears
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this is wonderful news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wondered if I was dealing with
somebody who was a little flaky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now over the years obviously I got to know
Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I greatly respect him and he's led the
charge on this whole question of the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal uses of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a number of years I think that
issue has carried its burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been probably more progress made
in that part of the drug issue in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years than in any other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what I see is I see this ecology and
economy movement beginning to discuss
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously what hemp could do for our
economy and how it can help us avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: polluting our ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that is both good in the sense that
I think it has merit in its own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also good because it makes it more
difficult for those who want to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to treat us as criminals to justify
marijuana as some evil drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm delighted at the movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect that there will be a lot of
progress in that area too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently you're working for the National
Association for Criminal Defense Lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you tell us a little bit what that's
about and still allow you to keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand active in the hemp movement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I haven't really for the last 10-12
years I haven't been active in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still know some of the people and
occasionally I'll drop by a meeting or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly feel a sense of history and
connection to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hemp movement I think is kind of a
younger person's game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not entirely but I think it's important
for all issues that every few years you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a new young group of idealistic and
committed and energized people who care
[SPEAKER_01]: very much about the issue that you kind of
pass the baton to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean they're just good enough they start
doing good work and you start realizing
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to help them with their projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what I do now is not terribly
different but it's not quite as focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent a cadre of lawyers who are
terribly committed to the Bill of Rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very concerned that the war on
drugs has in fact become a war on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Constitution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the Supreme Court has done in
essence is they've created an exception to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Fourth Amendment that's a drug
exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: If drugs are involved in a fact situation
they will overlook police conduct or
[SPEAKER_01]: overlook the absence of a warrant and
justify it on the basis of its drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's in an area without drugs
absolutely they throw the evidence out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well there's no drug exception in the
Constitution that's been created.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't call it that but that's what
they've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do much the same kind of work but
it's a little more broad-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: We oppose the death penalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We train criminal defense lawyers so that
they can do a better job at assuring that
[SPEAKER_01]: a citizen who is arrested has a fair
chance to tell his side of the story and
[SPEAKER_01]: that unless the government meets their
burden that individual ought not to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not terribly different from what I
did at normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about a minute left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our audience I'm sure is very interested
in your background and your knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: your perception of your avenues that
you've walked down in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you'd like to share
that would be of inspiration?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I'll tell you there was once when I
was young I'm 47 so when I was younger I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess I'm not quite dead yet but I went to
Ramsey Clark when I was first thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about starting normal because he was a
hero of mine from his anti-war work etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it formulated but it was a little
scary to quit my job and jump off the deep
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ramsey said to me I'd read his book I'm
sorry I'd read his book Crime in America
[SPEAKER_01]: and he talked about the need to legalize
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said Keith do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said well I want to but I need
encouragement from people like you who I
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I respect and you're wiser it
seems kind of suicidal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said do it when you're young when
you can be idealistic and make those kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of risks take those kinds of chances.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're older and you have kids in
college you have other considerations you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say the same thing to younger
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a sense of commitment and
you feel that somebody something you care
[SPEAKER_01]: about is important enough follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never had a moment of regret for
the 10 years I spent running normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've enjoyed having you on our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have you come back sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until we have the opportunity to get
together keep active in your community
[SPEAKER_00]: keep healthy keep wise keep strong.
Thank you.
