Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've helped over 110,000 people
across the whole country get medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana permits, and that's a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things we keep hearing from
the patients is, why do I have to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: in every year and get a card?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the program we've got right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot better than being thrown in
jail if you're sick of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least patients should be, you know,
out of the line of fire or on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the medical marijuana law has done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it continues to expand, but it's not
really the final solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Oregon Supreme Court just
ruled that, like California, that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: no appointment rights to test positive for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have a permit to do it
legally, then they can fire you at will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still having our kids taken away
from us in court proceedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still facing various forms of
prejudice against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really what we've got to do is end
marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do, we're going to restore
industrial hip at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what our Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act petition will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would allow anyone to grow their own
marijuana without a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even breed different types of
marijuana, and sell seeds and starts
[SPEAKER_00]: without getting a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a license if you want to
sell the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sell them to adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at international treaties and
implemented a system of controls that's
[SPEAKER_00]: mandated by these treaties, because
treaties carry the same weight as
[SPEAKER_00]: constitution and judicial proceedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to design a bill that would be
upheld in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we designed it the way we
did that had a lot to do with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because so often initiatives go through
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're ruled unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we designed this specifically to be
upheld in that federal court challenge by
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing a system of controls that
these treaties mandate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that would happen
with the proceeds from the cannabis is 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the state general fund, which the
majority of that goes to education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then 8%, no, 7% would go to drug
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that people who have problems with
drugs and alcohol can get help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, 95% of them are turned away
when they seek help dealing with substance
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% would go for a realistic drug education
program for kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 2%, the last 2%, would be
directed to promote hip biodiesel and hip
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I truly believe the reason marijuana
is illegal is because the petrochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: industries came up with the misinformation
campaign that we know as re-formatted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said marijuana, this deadly new drug,
even though it was one of the first crops
[SPEAKER_00]: people cultivated in all the first
agricultural societies on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said this deadly new drug called
marijuana based on racist, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda was to cause people to go crazy
and kill their family and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we know marijuana doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, what it does is the flowers of
marijuana produce a human neurotransmitter
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not just one, but several human
neurotransmitters that make people happy
[SPEAKER_00]: and giggle and feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they fight cancer too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look at this same place and
it makes seeds that make more oil and more
[SPEAKER_00]: protein per acre than any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 300 gallons of oil per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three times more than any other
biodiesel crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, 6,000 pounds of
residual protein after the seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed for that oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that protein is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost exactly what our bodies need
in terms of the protein profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of all different amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, those soybeans make a little bit
more protein.
M-protein is much more digestible.
[SPEAKER_00]: To digest all the soy protein takes two
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like palisade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we have a plant that produces
more fiber, more protein, more oil than
[SPEAKER_00]: any other plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is obviously a sacred gift from the
creator, the Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know it's a great thing that
we're given the task to free this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: to free industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when we do, we're going to
open up our economy for incredible new
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we start using hemp oil for cars,
for biodiesels, we won't need as much
petroleum.
Petroleum is very toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just imagine, the Exxon Valdez had
done to melt a load of hemp seed oil in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Prince William Sound there,
you know, 20-something years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have, you know, it would have
been nutrition for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the petroleum wiped out the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to restore hemp, and that's
what this petition will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm really proud and honored that
John Trudell and his bad dog band here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bad Dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are helping support this and give
this word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give some more petitions and
support our campaign and help us restore
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night.
