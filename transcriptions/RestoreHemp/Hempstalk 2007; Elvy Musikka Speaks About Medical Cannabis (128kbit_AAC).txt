[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to be back in Portland doing this
particular event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go back a long ways doing things
together in this state, don't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: For many many years I lived very far from
here down in Florida and you invited me to
[SPEAKER_00]: come and speak to your legislators and you
invited me to come and do some television
[SPEAKER_00]: shows with you Paul and you invited me to
come and get some signatures with you John
[SPEAKER_00]: Sage and there are so many others that I'm
not even going to start the list but the
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing I've learned is that people in
Oregon are the coolest of them all and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are beautiful cool people all over
the planet and the more you know about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis the more you're going to join
them and understand who you really are
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the largest minority in the United
States there are there is no segment of
[SPEAKER_00]: our society no religion no color no creed
no financial background that escapes it we
[SPEAKER_00]: all love cannabis and those who never
smoke cannabis well you got to feel a
[SPEAKER_00]: little sorry for them because they're
they're not in connection with their inner
[SPEAKER_00]: being for the simple reason that there are
receptors in their brain that have not
[SPEAKER_00]: been open for them to understand who they
really are but the most the more you know
[SPEAKER_00]: about this ancient tribal herb the one
that was given to you on the third day if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go by the Bible that's the one that
you dare when we accept mostly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States on the third day he said
behold I've given unto you every seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bearing or remember everyone not just the
ones that DEA likes you are a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: something that goes beyond time and
marijuana has always been in your system
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you never took a puff because it's
been in your system generation after
[SPEAKER_00]: generation after generation and the fact
that too many people don't have it in
[SPEAKER_00]: their system now I suspect contributes a
great deal to all the immune deficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are striking so many different parts
of our bodies I think you all know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: received I smoked 10 joints a day and
Uncle Sam is my supplier you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: right there are five of us in the entire
country who actually walking are walking
[SPEAKER_00]: around with a prescription not a
recommendation you all keep saying your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors are prescribing marijuana and all
the federal government will come very hard
[SPEAKER_00]: on them if they attempt to do such a thing
but there are five doctors that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: approved by FDA DEA and NIDA to write
prescriptions for us you know why because
[SPEAKER_00]: we were forced to exercise our instincts
of self-preservation are you not doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same if you're taking care of your illness
because we understood that a man-made law
[SPEAKER_00]: could not possibly wipe away our common
sense when it came to survival or to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the lovely the beautiful gift of
sight that I am blessed with however
[SPEAKER_00]: limited it may be I see stars and I see
the colors you wear and when you're close
[SPEAKER_00]: to me I see you smiling and I know we're
working together and this earth brought me
[SPEAKER_00]: to you because the person I was before I
smoked it or used it is someone I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even recognize I don't know I was a
different person growing with a different
[SPEAKER_00]: set of values one that said you know you
get the bigger house you get the nicest
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes you look really sharp all the time
and all this kind of crazy stuff and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you realize one day that the thing you
need most is your health in my case my
[SPEAKER_00]: sight and there is a crazy law that some
crazy people have created that says I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the right to self-preservation
or to maintain my sight well I argued that
[SPEAKER_00]: in court because I knew no government had
the right to demand blindness out of me or
[SPEAKER_00]: you or the kind of suffering this
prohibition is maintaining yeah I fought
[SPEAKER_00]: the law and I won I fought the law and I
won do we gotta fight it I am not any
[SPEAKER_00]: freer than you are as long as you're not
free I'm not I'm glad that I was a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these different organizations that
are here in Oregon that when it comes time
[SPEAKER_00]: to vote for something important you put
your personal differences aside and you
[SPEAKER_00]: come to the plate and we do work together
and we do make things happen we'll throw
[SPEAKER_00]: off the hat to all these wonderful people
to all of you in Oregon we hope to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you and to support all your efforts yes
John I definitely want to see dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: where patients can enjoy and relax with
each other's company while they Medicaid
[SPEAKER_00]: and yes I do want to sign your petition
Madeline I think a national petition is
[SPEAKER_00]: well overdue I worked on one in the 90s I
didn't quite get it to the Justice
[SPEAKER_00]: Department like I wanted well I actually
did but I didn't leave everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: addresses there anyway I want to thank you
for letting me do this take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: yourselves make cannabis legal in every
way you possibly can educate your
[SPEAKER_00]: legislators to the fact that when a man
made law is contrary to the law of nature
[SPEAKER_00]: it has no validity anytime anywhere under
any circumstances and let the true spirit
[SPEAKER_00]: of love always be your guiding light thank
you
