[SPEAKER_00]: This is, as you can see, Indian cannabis,
a fluid extract of Indian cannabis from
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyeth and Brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it is a cannabis compound
called Kilikoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really neat bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like bottles, then I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a chloroform cannabis mixture,
and it's called Kilikoff as a cough
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to it, we have this that also came in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also Kirkakal's cough medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a little package here with
instructions in Swedish, Bohemian,
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish, Italian, French, and several
other languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also cannabis and chloroform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that just knocked you out,
right, doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: You take cannabis and chloroform,
boom, you're knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have this one from Eli Lilly,
a one-pint bottle of fluid extract number
[SPEAKER_00]: 96 cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eli Lilly had about eight different
cannabis preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of them pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were fluid extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, powdered extract of hemp,
which was basically hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have this little package of hemp
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken it and lit this lamp to
demonstrate the energy potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, our hemp twine.
