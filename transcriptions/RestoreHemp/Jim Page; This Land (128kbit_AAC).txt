[SPEAKER_00]: This is Woody Guthrie's 100th birthday
this summer in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting thing about that is he
basically defined the art of the ballad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ballad when it comes from the concrete
situational life that you live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was a pretty important character in
our alternative culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took his most famous song,
which is This Land Is Your Land,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I rewrote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come gather round me, you're my sad story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you think you've heard someone sing
it before me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an old song, I had to change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Times ain't what they used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I went walking, a super highway,
below the gray haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so did the sky when I was arrested for
hitchhiking on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said it don't belong to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it ain't my land, and it ain't your
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be a rich land, but it's a poor
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other few that hold it in their
tight gripped hands so that it don't
[SPEAKER_01]: belong to you or me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was younger, and in my schooling,
I learned and followed by all the rulings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never dreamed that they were only
fooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could my teachers lie to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: But as time passed, and I grew older,
and the world around me got a little
[SPEAKER_01]: colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then a voice came calling at my
shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Said it don't belong to you or me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it ain't my land, and it ain't your
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be a rich land, but it's a poor
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other few that hold it in their
tight gripped hands so that it don't
[SPEAKER_01]: belong to you or me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the boardrooms of corporations to the
back rooms of desperate situations,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a confused and disunited mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way from city shining sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the urban war zones of the busted
streetlights to the toxic wastelands of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bad and test sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the open strip mines to the fear-cut
forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a sad sight to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the downsides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the layoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But corporate welfare, politician,
payoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the bread lines that never make the
headlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they are not so entertaining on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they can reduce you to just a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they can knock you down and they can
plow you under.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the only thing that matters is
the dollar, then you know it don't belong
[SPEAKER_01]: to you or me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it ain't my land, and it ain't your
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be a rich land, but it's a poor
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other few that hold it in their
tight gripped hands so that it don't
belong to you or me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a time when this song was
greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was then, and this is later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a hole in my heart just like a
crater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say it's going to be the death of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take this song back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take back our future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stand up tall so that everyone can
see then this land will belong to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: To you and me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be your land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be my land.
[SPEAKER_01]: From California to the New York island.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the redwood forest to the gulf stream
waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: This land will belong to you and me.
To you and me.
And it will be my land.
And it will be my land.
To you and me.
And it will be my land.
To you and me.
And it will be my land.
And it will be my land.
And it will be my land.
