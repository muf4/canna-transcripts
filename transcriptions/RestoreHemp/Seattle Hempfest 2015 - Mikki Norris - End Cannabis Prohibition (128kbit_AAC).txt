[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know who Peter McWilliams
was, Peter McWilliams was a publisher and
[SPEAKER_01]: a writer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote a book called Ain't Nobody's
Business If You Do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very well known in the Libertarian
Party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, unfortunately before he died,
he was a defendant in a court case.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was trying to sponsor some grows in Los
Angeles back in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he did that, they got busted by
the feds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, unfortunately Peter was an AIDS
patient and they would not allow him to
[SPEAKER_01]: use cannabis as a condition of his release
because they were drug testing him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, unfortunately Peter ended
up dying, choking on his vomit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was a hero to us before he died and
we were so happy for many years to honor
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter and his memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we're honoring Kevin Black.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's somebody we're going to miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just passed away this last June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kevin was the head of security here
for HemFest for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he did is he turned the HemFest
security into HemFest safety, making this
[SPEAKER_01]: a very peaceful event.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, HemFest has always been very
peaceful because, partially because
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumers are very peaceful
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we deserve that kind of respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kevin also was a bridge between law
enforcement and the HemFest family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he performed a very important service
here for HemFest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also, and that's important to get along
with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them to respect us because
cannabis consumers are some of the nicest,
[SPEAKER_01]: most honest, decent, intelligent,
creative people that you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than I know, that's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the good people and we really
deserve our equal rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's time that we're treated that way
and end this discrimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin also was a regional leader for the
November Coalition, which brought light to
[SPEAKER_01]: many people in prison on drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to update it and put some new
stories because, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's still way too many people in
prison, still way too many people getting
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested for marijuana offenses all over
this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But meanwhile, I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to Washington for passing I-502.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not perfect and a lot of
people aren't so happy with the way it's
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling out, but it sure sent a wonderful
message around the world that we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize it, that we need to stop this
discrimination against cannabis consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: in the workplace, the discrimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, unfortunately, is still going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: People take these P tests and then they
can't get a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not right, it's not fair,
and it has nothing to do with whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: can do a job or if they're impaired on a
job or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just outright discrimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to say no to drug testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Kevin also started, he was also
involved at the Million Marijuana Marches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are still going on these days around
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year I got to go to Australia and
then been there, which is kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis capital of Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have you know that the world is
watching Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're watching Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next year we're going to legalize it
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we're going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to learn from some of your
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, we still honor you for your
experiment here and for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully you'll all get involved in
demand that our rights are still
[SPEAKER_01]: respected, that we can do it the right
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is all about equal rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always been about equal
rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis consumers deserve equal rights,
don't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Equal rights!
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now!
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Equal rights!
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we want it?
Now!
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not over.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still too many people in prison,
too many people getting arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to stop that and bring freedom
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring freedom to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're watching and we really
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good Hempfest.
