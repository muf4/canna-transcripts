[SPEAKER_00]: I first came here in 1994, I believe,
and I brought this board, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: first modern hemp board that was made of
MDF that was made at Washington State
[SPEAKER_00]: University's labs in 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally, we brought through the first
real modern product at the highest level
[SPEAKER_00]: of credibility way back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Washington, the state of Washington
has been involved ever since as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the truth though, it is like you say,
we still can't grow it here, but I will
[SPEAKER_00]: also say that while I was doing this work,
the first experimental contract was given
[SPEAKER_00]: to the first Canadian farmer to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a proviso in the contract and it
allegedly said that they had to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual raw stock and make a finished
production prototype out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story I'm told is that 20 guys signed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is the stocks, I arranged to
have the stocks sent to our lab at
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created a board with their stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent it back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the farmer put that board in the
hand of the Canadian government
[SPEAKER_00]: representative, hemp became legal in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Washington is directly involved,
Washington State, in the legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And supposedly that's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I did this all because I wanted to
make a product that would show to the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole population what hemp could do and
what we could do in the area of building
[SPEAKER_00]: materials and to save our forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that this takes domestic
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes where we want to put the
factory right in the middle of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that yet.
