[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question for George.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are having a problem in curing our
cannabis to where we're trying to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: fine line between not letting it mold but
yet letting it get too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep them in the glass jars and we do
burp the glass jars because we have had
[SPEAKER_02]: some that did mold and so to prevent the
molding you know we are burping the jars
[SPEAKER_02]: but then we find that if we burp the jars
too much that it gets getting too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if he had any
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah you probably have mold on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably got mold before it goes into
the jar and generally what happens you
[SPEAKER_01]: probably have all kinds of mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big one is a powdery mildew and
botrytis isn't so bad but that's botrytis
[SPEAKER_01]: sinera but you can have this powdery
mildew and this year it's been horrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one year in Spain where it was
horrid two years and now it's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to start controlling it early on
because it's a systemic thing and it could
[SPEAKER_01]: start in your plants already right and you
have to kill it before it gets in if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do it organically because there's
a what is it bacillus subtilis is just one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bacillus you know bacterias and
serinades one of the products that they
[SPEAKER_01]: use right and you have to put that on your
plant before the mold comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to keep that up before
the mold comes and then after that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know keep mold other plants that are
molding away because this year it was
[SPEAKER_01]: horrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything had mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a crepe myrtles where I was growing
this year in California and they had it my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept ahead of it on some of them did an
experiment on the others and they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: look too well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway there's that point you start
there and then after that when you harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants you take all the branches you
know and you put them in a bucket a
[SPEAKER_01]: container like this full of water with
like say a two percent of solution of
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen peroxide yeah H2O2 and then you
soak them in there for a while it sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of funny but you soak them in there
the mold floats up to the top you skim
[SPEAKER_01]: that off might take a couple of times and
then you skim that off and then you take
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants and you lightly spray them
with water with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what it does to the
trichomes it may beat them a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would use like a light spray not
heavy spray just to kind of rinse it off
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you shake that and then you let
it dry or you can put it in a harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: machine or I mean a trimming machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then then you can put it into your
container you know but one that the second
[SPEAKER_01]: control I already gave was you know when
it had mold on it already and that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's hard to see you know once you
see it it's there it's inside the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I've been playing
with I was playing with one of those green
[SPEAKER_01]: lights you know you put on your head and
walk around in the green in the grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: with we were filming in a I'm doing a lot
of videos now and we were filming in a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room and I was looking around with
this green light and you can see the mold
[SPEAKER_01]: it sticks out yeah and so the next thing
I'm going to do is get the UVC light not
[SPEAKER_01]: UVB but UVC it'll burn your eyes but you
can shine it on the mold and it'll kill it
[SPEAKER_01]: right on the plant you know so that's a
big tip please pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something I'd like to say I just
came from dinner with my friend Jeff who
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote this book teaming with microbes and
it's an excellent book wonderful book it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all about growing organically you put a
good biology with your soil and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna grow a lot bigger plants you're
gonna have way fewer problems you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have gosh all of these invasions to
the roots and everything the microbes will
[SPEAKER_01]: help so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the mycorrhizal enzymes
for years that that helps the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: break down and feed the the roots those
what other microbes can the thing is the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is with the microbes they they make
the fertilizer the the the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: are available and they make them available
in the soil there's already a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things in the soil that just are not
available to make it available is a big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing just because something has a big NPK
number you know like 10 20 30 or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: on the on the label doesn't mean that the
plant is going to use it that plant it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't use that always or uses the
fraction of it the main thing is to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the the stuff used and anyway like I say
give this a shot and you'll be much
[SPEAKER_01]: happier and the other thing is to you know
people spend a lot for fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's not necessary you can you can
grow a 10 pound plant in a 200 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: container with good soil and for further
for your flowering fertilizer you have two
[SPEAKER_01]: hands two hands like this full of bat
guano should have gloves on because
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's poop it's not good but you
throw that on there and that's it that's
[SPEAKER_01]: all you have to give for the whole year
that's it you know so if you fill your
[SPEAKER_01]: head with good things you don't have to
put too much on your plants it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing very good point the big plant
video that you produced you're working on
[SPEAKER_00]: some others and you've got that one out
there on how the best way to do that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know I'm gearing up right now to make my
cuttings for this this April excellent you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I always try to make them right
around the first of year so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: they're good three to five feet tall when
they go in in April and you know that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what you have to remember this
plants really really easy to grow you know
[SPEAKER_01]: some people call it a weed it grows
everywhere everywhere it's amazing how big
[SPEAKER_00]: it will grow too yeah exactly it grows
huge 24 plants in an area and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: jam-packed and so now I've cut it back to
nine I've seen you know three plants fill
[SPEAKER_01]: a 60 by 30 greenhouse season yeah that's
totally possible there's people are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing plants you know 20 20 pounds you
know it's very very possible it's not that
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult the main thing is is it takes
time for it to grow that big you know if
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't have time you know the plants
indoors they can grow a meter high and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's it because the light is limiting
and the pot is limiting but when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant that's that has plenty of soil and
there's time for the biology to take place
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil for the for the roots to
absorb everything you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot bigger plant and like I say you're
taking your cuttings right after Christmas
[SPEAKER_01]: first of the year that's what you should
be doing and you're growing cuttings too
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I mean and but the thing is your
cuttings have been acclimated acclimated
[SPEAKER_01]: to this climate this is a Sunset Western
Garden Book Zone 8 8A or B I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember but you know that means the last
average day of frost is April 15th I think
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so I'm in zone 14 where I'm at in
California right now I can start a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier but the main thing is you could
put these plants outside you got to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them from flowering so that means they're
gonna need a little light to keep it from
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering because you know it's a daylight
sensitive plant but the other thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna need heat and that's about
it it can be raining cats and dogs outside
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as they're warm enough they're
gonna grow and they don't need tons of
[SPEAKER_01]: light early on in the year
