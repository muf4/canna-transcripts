[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Dan Herrer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if any of you have lost a loved one,
you know that sometimes speaking about
[SPEAKER_00]: them gets a little tough, so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father inspired people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped inspire the people that started
this event, events in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: helped to change lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helped to protect people's rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fought for the wrongful persecution and
prosecution of innocent victims of the
[SPEAKER_00]: drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went from state to state around this
country, and he taught everybody that he
[SPEAKER_00]: could, spoke to everybody, rich,
poor, old, young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did he try to teach them,
but he also listened to them, listened to
[SPEAKER_00]: what their fears were, listened to what
their hopes would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, you know,
your father left you a great legacy with
[SPEAKER_00]: his book, with his words, with the people
that he inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in all honesty, I think the legacy
that he left was what I see in everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: at every one of these events around the
states that I've been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are my father's true legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's through his words, and hopefully how
he's inspired you to show up at these
[SPEAKER_00]: events, participate, create new hemp
commerce that will create changes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you are the roads to the future
and the bridges that we must create and
create.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us to educate the other side of this
movement, and that is the uneducated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year ago this weekend, my father stood
on this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And expressed his feelings for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That without hemp as our future,
we would have no future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look out across this field and I see
hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see hope in the people that he loved and
cared for, whether he had ever met them or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you are the future of this
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the future of the ways these laws
are gonna change from state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am proud to say that I am his son.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm even prouder of the legacies that he's
created within each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrera everybody.
