[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everybody, friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bonnie King with SalemNews.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm kind of preaching to the choir,
but I just wanted to say a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born and raised here in Oregon,
like so many of you people were too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the daughter of commercial
beekeepers, some real salt of the earth
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of folks, and they believed in
America and they believed in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people that really wanted us to
live the life of liberty and happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sick, old, poor, rich, no matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I became a journalist,
being able to inform people and tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: things that they would not have already
known, to make them informed decision
[SPEAKER_00]: makers, to give them the knowledge that
they needed to do to be able to move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in their own lives is terribly
important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the friends that you all
have known for so many years, Dr. Phil
[SPEAKER_00]: Levesque, he was a real warrior for truth,
wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Levesque fought for the OMMP in the
90s, along with Paul Stanford,
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Loney, so many of you others,
and he was a do or die kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know absolutely, if he was standing
here right now, he would say he is mad as
[SPEAKER_00]: hell that they are doing this to our
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the OMMP, as it stands, is a healthy,
happy, successful program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like Scott said, it's an example for
others all over the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't something that needed to be
messed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Measure 91 was passed in good faith
by Oregon voters, they were obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: boondoggled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were obviously, you know,
somebody, somewhere had a strategy in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind, because this isn't what we voted
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three times in that bill were protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that this is not going to affect
the medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are, after all this time,
fighting for OMMP again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely unconscionable that the
lawmakers of our state would try to
[SPEAKER_00]: overrule the citizens of this state when
we know what is good for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of the sick and dying people of
this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't they the priority?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not just a roadmap for recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not why this program began.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not why we fought so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not why people served time in
prison and have died before this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to protect OMMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, people that have come before
me have said this too, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to stand for something or you'll
stand for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stand for what's right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand for what we voted for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand for the OMMP and stand for Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: OMMP.
OMMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoo!
