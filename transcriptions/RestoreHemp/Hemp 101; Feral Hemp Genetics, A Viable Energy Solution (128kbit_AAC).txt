[SPEAKER_00]: I know, Agra, that you've been working on
hemp fuel projects for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you talk about how feral hemp here
in the Midwest could solve our energy
[SPEAKER_00]: problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know that the feral hemp
genetics could solve our energy problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the feral hemp is a small amount of
the plant growth in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took the feral hemp stock and grew that
agriculturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we want to grow 500 acres of hemp
under the center pivot, and we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at what kind of preparations do we have to
undertake in order to grow a crop of a
[SPEAKER_01]: size that can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And assuming a hundred-fold increase,
you need five acres the year before that
[SPEAKER_01]: of seed crop, dedicated for seed,
not making food out of it, and five
[SPEAKER_01]: hundredths of an acre the year before
that, which is like 20 foot by 20 foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the year before that, two foot by two
foot, which is really one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're four years away from being
able to grow industrial hemp on a scale
[SPEAKER_01]: that can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Agra.
