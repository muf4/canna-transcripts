[SPEAKER_00]: Paul, this is for you if you're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul wanted to hear this song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian
Roulette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about, well, you know,
we're always, America's always posturing
[SPEAKER_00]: and posing and saying, you know,
those people over there, they want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get nuclear stuff going in
their own country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whether it's Iran or whoever it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, America's the only
country, the only country in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: that's ever used an atomic weapon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did it preemptively on a civilian
population twice.
Twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it in Hiroshima and they did it
in Nagasaki.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called Hiroshima Nagasaki
Russian Roulette.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dropped the bomb in 45 to end the
World War.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one had ever seen such a terrible sight
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world watched with eyes wide to see
where it would lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the politics of power passed around the
seat, it was the time to remember that we
[SPEAKER_00]: never can forget their play in Hiroshima
Nagasaki Russian Roulette.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rose like the saviors of a modern
human race with radiation halos that hung
[SPEAKER_00]: above their face with a key to the sure
cure and treatment of our ills.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hot shot of cobalt, a pocket full of
pills speaking armies of the enemy who
[SPEAKER_00]: looked across the seas while they moved in
among us like a carrier disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold up in the hire was hidden secretly
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The warheads and the submarines await to
make their play and the military
[SPEAKER_00]: masterminds improve on their designs while
the soldiers get all doped up and stumble
[SPEAKER_00]: through the lines and the leaks in the
water and get carried by the tide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it national security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it attempted homicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governors and statesmen on congressional
pay, quick to pleased, hand at feeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: careful what they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call out experts to assure us and to
wave their magic wands.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the power of the future,
they say, and the future marches on and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they gather up their favors and
political gains while the spills fill the
[SPEAKER_00]: rivers and settle in the plain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the minds behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are riddled full of holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not to be trusted with their
hands at the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their eyesight is twisted with the glory
of their careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heaped praise of flattery is music to
their ears and to listen to them talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about how it hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like playing
hee-wee-shee-na-na-ga-sa-kee-wee-shee-need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
