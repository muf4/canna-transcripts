[SPEAKER_00]: Here are today at the 20th anniversary
HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me great pleasure to introduce to
you somebody who is a champion of freedom,
[SPEAKER_00]: a champion of liberty, and a champion of
justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who gets it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who says, you know what,
otherwise law-abiding Americans shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: go to jail for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is our own Seattle City attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Pete Holmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him an incredible amount of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's here to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 20th birthday, HempFest.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're from Seattle, say hi to
everybody who's from out of state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Pete Holmes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vivian, thanks for the kind words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your city attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell you a couple of things that
I learned when I came to Iowa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle gets it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle understands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle is very smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, we couldn't explain why,
when I took office of the marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: possession charges that were in the
hopper, ready to go, why we're 59%,
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly 60% of them, against African
Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: This city has a population 8% African
American, and 59% of our marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: possession arrests, when I took office
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the war on drugs is a
failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that Seattle voters recognize
this and want to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And HempFest is where we're getting the
message out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this year signatures are being
gathered for new initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's at least two going now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that I'm sponsoring, 502, is to
legalize, regulate, and tax for adult
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It deals with all of the issues that we're
all confronting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my office, we're working every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to prosecute simple
possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to work to make sure that
until it's legalized for everyone,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we found a way for sick people to get
the medicine they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's good in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good news is, guys, a legislature
this year with Republicans and Democrats
[SPEAKER_01]: passed a comprehensive medical marijuana
bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The governor made a mistake, vetoed a lot
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't let that, don't let that,
we're going to be back in the legislature
[SPEAKER_01]: again, don't let that overshadow the fact
that a bipartisan legislature passed a
[SPEAKER_01]: great bill to get medical marijuana out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's good in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to work on all fronts to make
sure that ultimately adult recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: use is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do that by making sure
we work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we, marijuana reformers, are going to
all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we're trying to get to the same
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see two petitions, sign two
petitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sign one 505, sign 502.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for the same goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, my office is going to
continue to work to make sure that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: sane and rational prosecutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not prosecuting these cases,
and we're going to work to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we change the law in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be safe, be good to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, we're all working together
for the same purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greatest city attorney in the world,
as far as I'm concerned, Seattle City
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney Pete Holmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not prosecuting for possession of
marijuana in the city of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear that?
