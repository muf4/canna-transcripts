[SPEAKER_00]: We've made a lot of progress since last
year's hemp stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they didn't want us to have it
again here today, but we're here and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to comply with whatever rules they
make us comply with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue to push the
envelope until we can grow hemp without
[SPEAKER_00]: regard to its THC content, but with regard
to the most productive seed varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: the varieties that make the most protein
and oil, the varieties that make the most
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber, we shouldn't be judging seed and
fiber production by THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that high THC cannabis makes 20
times more seeds than what I call dwarf
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, the low, less than three-tenths of
1% hemp, and that makes twice as much
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we can restore hemp, the battle
is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The battle is not over, and we'll keep
pushing this envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to have an adult smoking
area right here in the park, just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol events can have their alcohol area
here in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol, as we know, is much more
dangerous than marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana will increase your lifespan for
most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have less stress, lots of powerful
antioxidants, you live longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can they say something so beneficial
is bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to educate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been misinformed in this huge
misinformation campaign we call Reefer
[SPEAKER_00]: Madness after that crazy movie the federal
government funded back in 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're here until we remove the stigma,
the falsehood, stigma surrounding
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, and I want to thank you all for
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go to our vendors, show them some
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see something you like, pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the rules, and we'll be back here
for Hempstock again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all you guys for coming
again and help us restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
