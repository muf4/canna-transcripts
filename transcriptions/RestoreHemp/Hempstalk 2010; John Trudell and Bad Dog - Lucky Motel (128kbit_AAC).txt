[SPEAKER_00]: During times of shadow, in the background
of burst, the sun waits for the moon to
[SPEAKER_00]: torch the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Torch the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the broken neon and faded light,
the lucky motel at the corner of nowhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and the past, where memories go to forget,
to forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laughing to erase, her name is laced in
the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes his crazy kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is want.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants want, but doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sparks of the stars, burnings,
strong heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat is like flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: As her fire awaits, she is a pulse,
a pulse in the charging light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a passion of storm, fiery rain,
lightning carries thunder.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a good girl, coming to understand
that sometimes this is what good girls do,
[SPEAKER_00]: what good girls do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the breath of song, in the magic of
moan, they held them together so as not to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel so alone, so alone, so alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: During times of shadow, in the background
of burst, the sun waits for the moon to
[SPEAKER_00]: torch the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the breath of song, in the magic of
moan, they held it together so as not to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel so alone, so alone, so alone.
Thank you.
