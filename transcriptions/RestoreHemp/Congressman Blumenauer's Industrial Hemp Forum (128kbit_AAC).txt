[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't we in a pickle, really,
to limit to .3?
[SPEAKER_01]: And isn't there, doesn't the department
need to be pushing the feds to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: mellow out and allow a broader definition?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the .3% THC definition is actually not
in federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: In federal law, they don't define
industrial hemp from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is in our state statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the Department of Ag, it would have
to be a legislative action, not an agency
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the .3%, and you guys can
probably talk about this more,
[SPEAKER_00]: better than I can, but I believe that
that's kind of an industry standard for
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp because it cannot be
construed as having any values.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is essentially a political
one, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, so just a little quick
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: The standard was developed in Europe and
then in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's sort of been a de facto
international standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't come up with that as like,
you know, uniquely kind of set up,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, this is what's working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Canadians and Europeans have been
able to develop a hemp industry around
[SPEAKER_03]: that standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, does it limit you somewhat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it might.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, is there a variety of
hemp that, you know, has half a percent
[SPEAKER_03]: THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it might be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that might be something we need to
take a look at down the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we ever see a situation where farmers
are growing hemp at five or 10% THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously doubt it because you're
talking about psychoactive varieties that
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody could pull out of the field and,
you know, and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that you have to make a
distinction there between generally the
[SPEAKER_03]: international, it's recognized as above 1%
you get into varieties that then have
[SPEAKER_03]: psychoactive potential when you're talking
about the THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but, you know, I wouldn't disagree
with you that it might be nice to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit higher or have the flexibility
to be able to say maybe a little higher
[SPEAKER_03]: than three tenths, but it is kind of what
it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a number of crops that have other
levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something like canola has to be below
2% heuristic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not versus industrial rape seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not uncommon to have these kinds
of biological limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are seed certification systems
both in Europe, Canada, here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: that once you've got varieties that are
known to have these low levels,
[SPEAKER_04]: to maintain those is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do cross breeding among the
varieties that are low in the THC levels
[SPEAKER_04]: and you should be able, you know,
there may be the occasional variety that
[SPEAKER_04]: would be useful or may have some useful
characteristic through traditional plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can oftentimes take something like
that, breed it into your low lines and
[SPEAKER_04]: breed something that has the new
characteristic using standard breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we not have any research data on
growing hemp from those years that might
[SPEAKER_02]: help us as we look at this new era of
gloriousness?
[SPEAKER_03]: So to answer your second question first,
we do actually, the picture that Errol
[SPEAKER_03]: showed of the 15 foot tall hemp plants in
Arlington, that was actually a USDA
[SPEAKER_03]: researcher named Lester Dewey who grew
hemp in Arlington Farms, which is now
[SPEAKER_03]: where the Pentagon is located in
Arlington, Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've actually got his diaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: He published a lot of research on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a lot of historical stuff and I
noticed that Rick has a great book here
[SPEAKER_03]: too by Chris Conrad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Hemp Lifeline of the Future.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some other books out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, you know, super technical on the
growing side, but there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: historical information out there on hemp
farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are bulletins.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were, the USDA and others,
other states did research bulletins back
[SPEAKER_04]: in the 40s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of information is available.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a USDA Ag Research Service
breeding program in Wisconsin,
[SPEAKER_04]: had been here in Oregon, down in
Corvallis.
[SPEAKER_04]: in Albany and they pulled it out in the
late 1930s and moved it to Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_04]: because conditions were better there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, as we went through this
whole craze in the 40s and 50s,
[SPEAKER_04]: they dumped all the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So historically where material was put
into a national germplasm repository,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's none of that present these days,
but there are international seed sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has any thought been given through your
organization as a viable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the carbon sequestration is
definitely, you know, that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the building with hemp herd,
where they're basically locking it into,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, mixing it with lime and then
that actually sequesters carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the research they did over in the UK
on that shows that there's actually more
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon captured in the construction
process than what's normally released.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a carbon negative construction
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, I think that's going to be a
huge market for hemp once we get it grown
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense to import.
[SPEAKER_03]: Herd is so light and bulky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just trying to import that from
overseas or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you're growing it here,
you can build homes, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're extremely good thermal properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another, other benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's using lime, you don't
have any problems with mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's a big issue here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think with your weather climate,
that it might be a big significant thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some real advantages there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as the fuel goes, I just think
that the jury's still out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two ways you can get fuel from
hemp that I know of anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, maybe there's more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't claim to be an expert on fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know the hemp seed, I think,
is too high value to be realistic as a
[SPEAKER_03]: mainstream fuel source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe somebody's going to do it on their
farm or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the biomass conversion,
you know, there's been some research on
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that still isn't fully commercialized,
except like with maybe sugar cane in
[SPEAKER_03]: Brazil or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they haven't gotten there yet,
but there's definitely potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed is a part of the statute in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it directs the Department of
Agriculture to write rules about the
[SPEAKER_00]: handling of seed, as well as the growing
and selling of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have regulations already in Oregon
actually for seed dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any agricultural or vegetable seed
producer or dealer has to be licensed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the State Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will fall under a similar
licensing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be something that will come
out in the rules as we develop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third question, I'm sorry,
was about potential cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have OSU sitting on our panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll hope that they can give us some
guidance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the statute sets the limit at
0.3%, that's one of the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned we'll have to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the tolerances and how we will
determine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know, I don't think,
I've seen some research or heard that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-contamination having two fields next
to each other could actually damage
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only the THC level that you might be
shooting for for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also keeping the other one under 0.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not a researcher and don't know
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will certainly be something that
we'll have to look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the statute doesn't direct us
to have control areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to work through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets into quite a bit of different
other laws in terms of right to farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the Farm Bureau sitting on our
rules advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually involved in those right to
farm issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully they can advise us as
well on that issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's typically done, you know,
in a situation like this is there are
[SPEAKER_04]: generations of seed that are produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you start with something called breeder
seed or foundation seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there would be very specific isolation
requirements for where that seed could be
[SPEAKER_04]: grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as you go through the
generations, those tend to ease up a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But oftentimes the commercial crop is not
harvested for subsequent seed use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you could have what would be called
foundation registered seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The certified seed would be sold
commercially produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even there, if there were some small
level of contamination, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: carry into the next generation of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have to figure out what are the
isolation distances that you need to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it would be up to those people to
work with their neighbors to make sure if
[SPEAKER_04]: they're producing early generation seed
that they didn't have medical marijuana in
[SPEAKER_04]: those areas to try to keep the THC under
control.
Thank you.
