[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice to be at the HempFest,
frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me when I first got in
town, why do you still have the HempFest?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you guys won.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we won in the sense that marijuana
is now legal in Washington, but we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: near finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of problems that still
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, people still lose their jobs
every day in Washington, not for showing
[SPEAKER_01]: up to work in an impaired condition,
but because they smoked on the weekend and
[SPEAKER_01]: they got drug tested on the first of the
week and they have THC in their system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously unfair.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have young parents who are having
to fight for child custody, to retain
[SPEAKER_01]: custody of their child, when the only
suggestion is that they're not fit parents
[SPEAKER_01]: is that they smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's left over from reefer madness days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have some problems with DUID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still need the right to grow our own
marijuana in Washington, where
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational users still can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of work to still be done
before marijuana smokers are treated
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly, but I will say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people in Washington deserve enormous
credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You broke the door prohibition wide open,
you and Colorado, and there's no turning
[SPEAKER_01]: back, so we are in your debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: A gallop had first asked the question of
how many Americans support legalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1969, it was the year before we started
normal, and only 12% of the public
[SPEAKER_01]: supported legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: 88% were opposed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, fast forward to about three years
ago, when for the first time, the national
[SPEAKER_01]: polling began to show a slight majority of
the country favoring full legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got five or six polls that show
anywhere from 51% to 58% of the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that they're pro-pot,
it is that they understand prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a failed public policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only about 14% of the country are regular
smokers, 86% are not, but the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: those non-smokers now support our position
of full legalization, so as long as we
[SPEAKER_01]: retain their support, there's no turning
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've known for at least 10 or 15 years
that we were going to win this battle
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the demographics, but all the
surveys showed were that older Americans,
[SPEAKER_01]: people my age and older, were the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew up in the middle of reefer
madness, and it's hard to change people's
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion if that's their whole world
they've known, but we also noticed that
[SPEAKER_01]: younger Americans, whether they smoked or
not, it didn't much matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is no big deal to them,
so we knew eventually our fallback
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy we used to laugh was,
if necessary, we'll outlive the bastards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in some degree, I think that's what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generously, the younger Americans were
always going to eventually legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't sure that I would live long
enough to see it, and I tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am exhilarated every morning when I get
up to have the chance to witness this
[SPEAKER_01]: really happening in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we thank you for putting the lawyers
together into a group that could learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about protecting the laws and just helping
people not see the drug war being so hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to their families.
