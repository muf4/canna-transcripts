[SPEAKER_00]: Monk Shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bad Dog Puppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puppy Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went on tour with Midnight Oil in 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big deal man, so fuck you know everybody
wanted to be part of the band,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the reality was it was poor pay and
hard, it was a hard tour man, it was you
[SPEAKER_00]: know very grassroots man, it was hard tour
and we did like 32 cities you know in 40
[SPEAKER_00]: days or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got, we started losing band
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven members of a band started,
we started losing band members along the
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we got to Midwest there were
three of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Peter Garrett said well hey you know
it's your call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your band's gone man, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway we hung in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how we did this out of
necessity because it was we needed to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we needed to do because we needed to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah we'll just go for it you know
there's no I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to be done you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway I don't know what value that
has, but it has some value somewhere if
[SPEAKER_00]: you really think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a young face, an old face.
[SPEAKER_00]: She carries herself well through the ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: She survives all a man has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some tribes she is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some states she is property owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some classes she is worth what she
consumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some nations she is delicate strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some religions she is told she is weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some classes she is property owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all instances she is sister to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all life she is our necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all conditions she is life-giving.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the woman eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers swaying on scattered hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calling in the bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the woman heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender butterflies fronting the blue
sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the woman beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lightning streaking dark summer nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest of pines mating with new winter
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the woman spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily serving courage with laughter,
her breath, a dream, and a prayer.
Thank you.
you
