[SPEAKER_00]: I love the global cannabis march because
it's my activism or my cannabis activism
[SPEAKER_00]: anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first global cannabis march I came to
was in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came as a volunteer for what was PDX
normal at that time and I registered
[SPEAKER_00]: voters and I created a mailing list of
people who were interested in getting
[SPEAKER_00]: information about cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little did I know that by suggesting that
maybe we send these people a letter I
[SPEAKER_00]: would become the secretary of what was
Oregon normal and a founder of Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: normal and be here 14 years later still
working for cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honored to be here and I think that
one of the things that it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important that we talk about today is to
remember to be grateful for those who have
[SPEAKER_00]: come before us and to remember that
gratitude is the attitude to have moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things not to like
about what the government is trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: around implementing measure 91 and I echo
Madeline's sentiments that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: press our legislature hard this year to
implement measure 91 as it was written.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they leave the medical
marijuana program alone but here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing a lot of people are getting really
mad about that and they're all up in arms
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would say to you this measure 91
they say doesn't go far enough it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: how many plans can you legally have now
any of you that aren't patients none so
[SPEAKER_00]: four looks pretty good to me right I mean
I think I could probably grow four decent
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and they would turn out I mean I
don't know I'm not that good at it but I
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow some weed too so if everybody can
grow just a little then isn't that a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing instead of going to jail instead of
losing your family instead of losing your
[SPEAKER_00]: job I would say yes so how did that come
about well it came about from years and
[SPEAKER_00]: years of people advocating for cannabis
freedom before many of you ever even knew
[SPEAKER_00]: it was happening and I would say we need
to thank those people we need to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: those organizations that stepped up first
that came out first and showed us the way
[SPEAKER_00]: and led the path the way to where we're at
now which is inches from legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: we're two months away from being able to
just smoke a joint at home without having
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about getting busted how cool is
that it's the coolest so remember to have
[SPEAKER_00]: gratitude for organizations like normal
like students for sensible drug policy
[SPEAKER_00]: like CRRH the THCF clinic and people like
Madeleine Martinez Paul Stanford Scott
[SPEAKER_00]: Gordon Aiko and all of those who have come
before us who made it possible for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: be where we are I think that if we
remember our history moving forward we can
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward more quickly because we can
learn from the mistakes that were made in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past my name is Anna Diaz and I am
proud to be a stoner join me and let's end
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis prohibition once and for all
thank you
