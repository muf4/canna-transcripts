[SPEAKER_00]: But let us celebrate House Bill 3460.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is allowing more transparency and
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is helping us in our markets,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks, don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, however, our marijuana law is full
of gray areas, areas that we all have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, possessing and growing marijuana
must be out of public view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of public view means out of public
view, not on your front porch,
[SPEAKER_00]: not in your car with the visor down,
not in the parking lot of the concert,
[SPEAKER_00]: or as Scott says, not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be professional about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to remember how to count,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no such thing as extra plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no such thing as extra plants just
in case your plant's hermy or one dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your plant count is your plant
count no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to know how to weigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive, the police weigh everything,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including that bag of leaves you intended
to compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please remember, your card does not
protect you on federal land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can and will get a citation that will
cost you money and potentially your
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom and your student aid if you're in
college just for simply possessing a
[SPEAKER_00]: single joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, always, always, always remember
the old TV ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never leave home without your card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know when you have to prove that
you're legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, do you want more freedom, folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants more freedom?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, remember to register to
vote and vote to legalize next fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a legalization measure
on the ballot next fall, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have to register to vote and vote
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convince your neighbors to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convince your family to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote for freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't say to folks, hey, vote to
legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote for freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're voting for freedom when we vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, those of you who might have
seen me before, remember I have these four
[SPEAKER_00]: sayings that I'd like people to repeat
after me when I say them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is what you need to do when
you're at a police encounter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your car, when you're walking at your
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll say them and please repeat after
me because we all have to practice these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're brushing our teeth,
we're walking down the street in our car,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of singing to the radio,
practice these sayings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, a little bit louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, folks, and one last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hope you pay attention because
I have t-shirts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who can say one of the four magic
sayings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who can say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Thank you.
