[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to free the people who are in
prison for pot we need to free the
[SPEAKER_00]: children who are held hostage by CPS away
from their loving families And we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: restore the rights of those who have been
stunted by felony drug convictions
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairness equality social justice equal
opportunity Just injustice is here and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's happening Now the human solution is
going to come up and give a message and
[SPEAKER_00]: they may talk about Shana Banda who is
fighting today for her 11 year old son
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana changed her life and she
educated her community and her son and
[SPEAKER_00]: when he corrected the school that was
giving misinformation they took that 11
[SPEAKER_00]: year old in kept him in custody raided his
mother's home took her medicine and her
[SPEAKER_00]: son and she's fighting for him and that's
today and even in Colorado where I remind
[SPEAKER_00]: you marijuana is legal angel price lane
was taken from her parents when she was 11
[SPEAKER_00]: months old because her father said he
recreationally smoked marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally I remind you again it was
legal within a month that baby was given
[SPEAKER_00]: to a 19 year old who had three other kids
and she died that month a blunt force to
[SPEAKER_00]: the head repeated blunt force to the head
there are people who are losing their jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: there are people who are losing their
children and there are people in prison
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is our right to be here to speak
and to exercise those rights but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: our duty to be the voice of those people
who can't be heard because they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: prison or they are held so we need a bill
that automatically causes review of
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody serving time for pot we need
protections for parents so that
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible use is not a reason to take
kids away
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the four states in DC that have
legalized recreational use and in the more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 20 states that have medical law
nobody has protected prisoners yet so make
[SPEAKER_00]: it a part of every cannabis conversation
justice equality equal opportunity and
[SPEAKER_00]: join me join normal normal women of
Washington equal justice and liberty for
[SPEAKER_00]: all yeah you
