[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks you guys I am so happy to be here I
can't even tell you as I say every year
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my activist anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for coming to my party y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy you're here You know I was
one of the founders of Oregon normal and
[SPEAKER_00]: then in 2013 I was approached by a man
named Mickey Martin who was a an activist
[SPEAKER_00]: in California and if you know him you
either loved him or you hated him because
[SPEAKER_00]: he was a man of very strong opinions but
he also became my mentor and my friend and
[SPEAKER_00]: my brother through our work together with
parents for pot and today since we're
[SPEAKER_00]: memorializing the people that we've lost
I'd like to add him to the list because we
[SPEAKER_00]: lost him last June sadly he was the
driving force behind parents for pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: he and now that he's gone I feel compelled
to take up the torch that he left and
[SPEAKER_00]: carry on the work for parents for pot one
of the things that he used to say was that
[SPEAKER_00]: he likes weed and he's a good person I
think that's true for everyone here even
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't consume cannabis you can
still like weed and you're still can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good person the goal of parents for pot is
to remove the stigma of cannabis use for
[SPEAKER_00]: parents and families so that we can
participate in the world like everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else I hear stories from people every day
who are good people who are taxpaying
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have lost their bank accounts
because the bank found out that their
[SPEAKER_00]: money came from cannabis and they closed
their personal bank accounts I hear from
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are working hard making a lot
of money trying to buy houses who can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get a loan because every time they get to
that step where they find out that they
[SPEAKER_00]: work in the cannabis industry they're
denied these this poor family has an empty
[SPEAKER_00]: house brand-new built waiting for them
they're good people who like weed I hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from parents whose children are being
taken away from them even now even in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Russ Belleville just told me a
story today that warmed my heart because
[SPEAKER_00]: the woman won her children back because
why she was a good person who liked weed
[SPEAKER_00]: so we need we still have a lot of work to
do there is so much stigma around cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: use that when I first started speaking at
these events back in 2001 it was
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutionary for me to call myself a
proud stoner I think that all of us here
[SPEAKER_00]: can honestly openly say that we are all
proud stoners we function in this world we
[SPEAKER_00]: pay our taxes we do what we need to do and
we should just be left alone for that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all know that weed is much less harmful
than any other legal substance that a
[SPEAKER_00]: adults are allowed to consume probably
safer than even sex so what is the big
[SPEAKER_00]: deal and yet we're treated we're
marginalized we're treated like criminals
[SPEAKER_00]: parents are being parents are being sent
to child protective services by their own
[SPEAKER_00]: children's doctors for recommending
cannabis instead of the poison that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical company wants to feed them
what is wrong with this people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis as the last resort for their
health issues when if they had used it as
[SPEAKER_00]: their first resort their health would
probably be much better why is that
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are stigmatized because we are
marginalized for our choice of recreation
[SPEAKER_00]: and our choice of medicine parents for pot
works hard to bring this to an end and we
[SPEAKER_00]: need your help to do it too all you have
to do is do like I do stand up be proud I
[SPEAKER_00]: work every day I go to work every day weed
doesn't keep me stuck to my couch I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: totally functioning I'm high right now so
I say this and I want you to say it with
[SPEAKER_00]: me I like weed and I'm a good person I
want everyone here to say it so that
[SPEAKER_00]: Mickey Martin can hear it in heaven join
me now I like weed and I'm a good person
[SPEAKER_00]: what I can't hear you I can't hear you
people way back there I like weed and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a good person right one more for the cheap
seats I like weed and I'm a good person my
[SPEAKER_00]: name is Anna Diaz I'm a proud stoner and
