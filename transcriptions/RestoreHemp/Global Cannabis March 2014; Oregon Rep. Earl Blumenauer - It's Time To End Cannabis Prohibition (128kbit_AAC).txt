[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon has led in innovation nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've protected our beaches, the bottle
bill, land use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty years ago, Oregon was the first
state to decriminalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was an impressionable young
legislator, actually voted on that
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was another debate that occurred
during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that session, it was led by a
conservative Republican pig farmer from
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermiston, Oregon, a remarkable gentleman
named Stafford Hansel, who had a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguished career as a long-term state
legislator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was active in administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped protect the land use system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Stafford gave what I think was one of
the most compelling speeches I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: heard in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here was a conservative Republican,
didn't smoke, drink, swear, who got up and
[SPEAKER_00]: led the state legislature through a
tutorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pointed out a package of cigarettes
that killed 400,000 people a year that was
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a bottle of Jack Daniels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it may have been the only time
he'd ever held a bottle of liquor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he pointed out that for some people,
alcohol was toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it contributed to the deaths of tens
of thousands of people on the highway each
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had a baggie with a marijuana
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he pointed out that people didn't die
from it, that it wasn't as addictive,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't as destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he proceeded to defend a bill we had
on the floor of the House that would have
[SPEAKER_00]: authorized two plants for personal
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm told by knowledgeable people at the
Capitol at that time, if the 19 of us who
[SPEAKER_00]: voted for it had been joined by the people
who voted no, but smoked dope,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it probably would have passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oregon would have been the first state
to legalize adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, Oregon was having this
discussion about a more rational approach
[SPEAKER_00]: to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were watching at the federal level a
war on drugs being launched in the Nixon
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a much different approach to
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legacy of that war on drugs was
classifying marijuana as a schedule one
[SPEAKER_00]: drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consequences of that are legion.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, as you know,
classifying marijuana as being as
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous as heroin or LSD is simply
false.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's false.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telling people that it is more dangerous
than cocaine or methamphetamines,
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule two, the meth epidemic that is
destroying rural and small town
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, suggests we've got our
priorities upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also suggests to me part of a need to
reappraise what can only be described as a
[SPEAKER_00]: failed war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spending $25 billion a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are arresting three quarters of a
million people a year for something that
[SPEAKER_00]: most Americans now think should be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are, as you're well aware,
some of the most egregious racial
[SPEAKER_00]: disparities targeting young
African-American men greater than any
[SPEAKER_00]: other sector of the population,
even though their use is no greater,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even a little less, than white young
men.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people doing time now as a
result of the consequences of this act.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been involved in Congress in the
effort to help rationalize our drug
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, drug approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it is to make sure that the
federal government is not interfering in
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the lie in federal statute as a
category with schedule one narcotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has no medicinal therapeutic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, voters starting in California
in 1996 as the first state followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon in the next election, we now have
21 states and the District of Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: representing over 100 and 6 million
Americans who have access that's legal
[SPEAKER_00]: under state law to medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: A million Americans now are legally
authorized to have access, and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard countless stories about the
difference that it has made in their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of what we're doing in Congress,
and I will tell you I'm encouraged because
[SPEAKER_00]: we now have 13 pieces of legislation,
most of it bipartisan, to try and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: some sense into this upside down world
that is marijuana regulation in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have legislation and bipartisan support
to stop the lunacy of making legal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana businesses be all cash
enterprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the logic here?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you care about money laundering,
if you care about tax evasion or just
[SPEAKER_00]: burglary, forcing perfectly legal
enterprises to pay their taxes with a
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping bag full of $20 bills,
doesn't make any sense at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or because of a quirk in the tax law,
forcing them to pay two and three times
[SPEAKER_00]: higher tax rates, again for perfectly
legal businesses, is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell you, some of you are
familiar with a conservative Republican
[SPEAKER_00]: tax advocate, Grover Norquist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grover was with me at a press conference
for my bill to allow legal marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses to deduct their business
expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how far we're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how far we're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday, on the floor of the House,
I had an amendment that would have allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: our veterans to be able to talk to their
VA doctors about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should our veterans be treated as
second class citizens in those states
[SPEAKER_00]: where medical marijuana is legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should they not be able to talk to
their primary doctor about whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: right for them or wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't successful, but we got 195
votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including two dozen Republicans who said,
this doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was told by one of my Republican
co-sponsors of the legislation that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced that there were 12 or 13
Republicans who, if they better understood
[SPEAKER_00]: it, would have voted with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the move in the United States
Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed an amendment that allows
research agriculture institutions to
[SPEAKER_00]: research industrial hemp, which passed
with a significant yes vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have a dozen states that are poised
to allow industrial hemp production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have signals from the
administration that these are part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller fish that the administration's not
going to fry, that we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: proceed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you have been involved with trying
to promote not just the use of legal hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: products, which of course they are,
and they're sustainable and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that Oregon farmers and ranchers
can't grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky tobacco farmers can't grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be imported from outside the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're turning the corner on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do a better job, I think,
of breaking the stranglehold of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pernicious classification that prevents
research into marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up on the hill, I met with neurologists,
people who are dealing with problems of
[SPEAKER_00]: our children.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked about those with violent
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These parents are willing to move their
families to be able to have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana that will prevent these
violent seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the scientists cannot get marijuana to
study what works and why.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an outrage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon was a leader 40 years ago in
decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon has a chance to be the explosion
that breaks the dam on marijuana policy
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great what we have in Washington and
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that we've got 21 states in the
District of Columbia with medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're just on the cusp right now of
changing national policy once and for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be great in Alaska if this summer
they legalize adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Alaska is sort of up there and out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the land of the Midnight Sun
and Sarah Palin is going to start a
[SPEAKER_00]: national trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that medical marijuana is on
the ballot in Florida this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 700,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But given the Florida Constitution,
it'll require a 60% less yes vote to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Oregon, we have an opportunity to
cast a ballot for a rational marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: policy that will be followed across the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll open the floodgates in California in
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get down to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tax it, regulate it, keep it out of
the hands of the kids, and stop
[SPEAKER_00]: interfering with people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd ask you to study it, get involved,
sign a petition, and spread the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can have success this November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
