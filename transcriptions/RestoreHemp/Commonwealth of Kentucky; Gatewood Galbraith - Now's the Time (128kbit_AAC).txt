[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a hell of a chance of winning
in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our primaries are this coming Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not in the primary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're totally independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what interest you may have in what,
how I do out there in that race is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to take a giant leap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a giant leap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go all the way to find out
whether America still has a pulse or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do it constitutionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States Constitution does not
provide you the right to life,
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an independence, Declaration of
Independence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't officially have a right to
that under federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Kentucky has a constitution also,
just like all the other states do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just so happens that Kentucky's
constitution is the most pro-people
[SPEAKER_00]: constitution ever written.
[SPEAKER_00]: That our people back in 1890 got so tired
of being raped by the railroad companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that they wrote a constitution that
protected the people and kept corporations
[SPEAKER_00]: from running roughshod over everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even now, that's beginning to fracture
as our legislature keeps summing out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the folks that I call the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: transnational, corporate fascist elite son
of a bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going to happen is that the very
first section of Kentucky's constitution
[SPEAKER_00]: ensures that its citizens constitutionally
are endowed with the right to life,
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the number one section in
Kentucky's constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel obliged to make it the number
one basis of policy for my relationship of
[SPEAKER_00]: government to the people and state of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get it off of their backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take it out of the bedrooms
and the bloodstreams and the brains and
[SPEAKER_00]: the bladders and the billfolders and back
pockets and the internet bulletin boards
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them back in the little box where
they belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make government not a burden
on the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the role of government to
uplift, enlighten, educate, and endow
[SPEAKER_00]: people with an appreciation of life,
appreciation of the social compact,
[SPEAKER_00]: their civil duties, their civil
responsibilities, and make sure that we
[SPEAKER_00]: address them as sovereign human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: People making their own decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could do this, if I can win this,
it's going to be bigger than Ventura.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be next to Obama's election because
there was an independent elected governor
[SPEAKER_00]: of Rhode Island in this past one,
the first one elected in 150 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he had been a state senator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had been a US senator from state of
Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had that base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but we'll be the first truly
independent ticket ever to win governor in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Kentucky in the last 150
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, I've got a website called
gatewood.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a criminal defense attorney out in
Lexington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I handle criminal cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to represent a lottery winner or
two if any of y'all know who you are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a big dog and you're hanging out
on millions, there's a good place to give
[SPEAKER_00]: me a fee and let me get on down the road
on this campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can drop something, five,
10, 20 bucks in on gatewood.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you a copy of my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ex governor of the state of Kentucky
said it was the best statement of freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: in America that he'd ever read.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the same day, an 18 year old girl from
the middle of the mountains called me,
[SPEAKER_00]: said she had read it twice previous week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the number one seller at Joseph
Beth, the top independent bookstore in
[SPEAKER_00]: America for 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left out 100% of the sex and 8% of
the drugs, but it's still a kick ass read.
Thank you.
Thank you.
