[SPEAKER_01]: You inspired so many people with your
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a book first on rating cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years before high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years before high times, like 1970 or
so?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy-three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy-three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, when I first met you,
I'd seen an article in the Yippee
[SPEAKER_01]: newspaper, Overthrow, called the CMI White
Paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of about three pages
long and laid out kind of the gist of what
[SPEAKER_01]: was the outline of your future book,
The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dana Beale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took them for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, oh, that's some wonderful
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in Overthrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how that got published there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got mad at Dana for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't blame you, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: He deserved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that then in 85, you wrote the
first edition of your book right here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland, in River City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, for a while, it was the
CMI-OMI White Paper, the California
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Initiative, the Oregon Marijuana
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first few editions were like
newsprint editions.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were handed out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first edition and the second edition
were a 110-page book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third and fourth edition,
they've got 90,000 copies for the campaign
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Oregon Marijuana Initiative in 86.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember every neighborhood they handed
those out in, I think, oh, am I one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 15 cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Precincts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 15 precincts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's handed out twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three times and four times,
it's got handed out because the guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90,000 people, and about 30 of them,
30,000, got once, twice, three times and
[SPEAKER_00]: four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won those by 60 or 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many copies have been sold now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many languages is your book,
The Emperor Wears No Clothes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's the number one seller in
Germany, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 100 magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 750,000 copies in the United
States and about 500 or 600,000 copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is about 10 or 15
companies, Japan, Korea, Hungary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in all these different languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but they don't pay me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess your copyright is only as good as
your ability to enforce it.
