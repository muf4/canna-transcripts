[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like everything was cooler in a
different way before Parker, Shane,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Neville came home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope was such an echo that it seemed
finally nobody would let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running back and forth looking to my
mistake believing it's only one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: When everyone I know seems more hungry in
his house just ain't no home.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's nowhere to run to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like everything was easy when we
were to hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these days they seem to evil roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bumping through the problem like a wharf
is steeped.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way support and cheer we all
decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running back and forth looking to God and
faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every corner seems to lead to the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: When time is so constricting that you want
to escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the tracks just won't let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's nowhere to run to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only what comes are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's work from home too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just sit back and watch it explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's nowhere to run to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only what comes are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's work from home too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just sit back and watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's nowhere to run to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only what comes are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's work from home too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just sit back and watch it explode.
When there's nowhere to run to.
