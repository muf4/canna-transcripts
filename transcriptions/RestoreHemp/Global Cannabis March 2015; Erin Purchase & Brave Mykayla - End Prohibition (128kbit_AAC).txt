[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Brave Makayla and I kicked
cancer's butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the help of cannabis oil,
I have finished treatments six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for the love and support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace, love, care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you so much for being here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Erin Purchase and I am
Makayla's mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been an activist long before she got
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I knew to give her cannabis oil
ten days after she was diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important that all patients
get this oil right when they are diagnosed
[SPEAKER_00]: because she never even lost a single pound
going through chemotherapy and never had
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a Tylenol and had a smile on her
face every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important that every child
and adult have that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do that, we have to get
our doctors on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do that, we need to change
the law at a federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, Oregon, for legalizing at
a state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get more states to do that,
maybe we can overturn federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very, very, very important to my
family that we overturn this federal law
[SPEAKER_00]: and research has began.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makayla has a very rare form of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a low survival rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to worry about that because
I had cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most families don't have that and they
have a lot of anxiety as they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do they have a lot of anxiety,
they're dealing with a child who's
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering with a feeding tube in their
nose and they have to stay in the hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes over a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 14 days in a hospital and the only
reason my daughter ever had to stay in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital was because they gave her,
forced me to give her drugs that put her
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had two allergic reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them almost killed her because of
their medicine that she did not need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to prove that she did not need
it, we have to change the federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, at a county level and a local level,
you are all very important because Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: has legalized cannabis, but they have also
imposed a lot of regulations that affect
[SPEAKER_00]: patients like Makayla.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have limited our medical marijuana
grows now inside city limits to 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from being able to grow from four
patients to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not passed that bill yet,
but they're very close to passing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to Salem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there Mondays and Wednesdays right
now at 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you to tell them we don't want to
change things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do is go to your
county and city commissioner meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to Clackamas County commissioner
meetings every single month and I'll tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you what, as you guys are rushing out
finding warehouses, they're imposing
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations to zone you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to your county commissioner meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop looking for a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop looking for commercial property and
get to your legislators and your
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives and start talking to them
about what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only what you want to do for the
marijuana industry, but what you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do for our community because if you don't
support your community, they're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to support you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please support your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Present yourself appropriately and support
this plan and let's get somewhere because
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want kids to suffer and I just
proved that they don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people need to know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: More doctors need to support this.
[SPEAKER_00]: More politicians need to be on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's support the other industries,
the other movements, the other civil
[SPEAKER_00]: rights movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help our industry make it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say thank you so much to Sony
Girl Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving me the opportunity to speak
on your behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also made the oil that saved my
daughter's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, I can't thank them enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jen and Mike Mullins,
Jennifer Valley and Mike Mullins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sony Girl Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys mean the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
