[SPEAKER_00]: I have a rare brain disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna use cue cards, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a gram and a half of FECO today
already just to be here with ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you can bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, fellow freedom fighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Janice Patton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have idiopathic intracranial
hypertension.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been successfully treating this
rare brain disease by using large amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of full extract cannabis oil or FECO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not be delivering a speech today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more like an impassioned plea for
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to pay homage to those
people that have fought so hard for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long to get cannabis where it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I want to talk about the importance
of education and awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing up to events like this helps show
community support and unity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also shows that we are peaceful and
organized people.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be aware means taking advantage of
times you can talk about your positive
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences with cannabis to your doctors
and nurses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important there, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even government officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I want to talk about compassion and
human suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many average everyday people
just like you and me that have serious
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people deserve a quality of life the
same as everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to show the people who make the
laws in this country that we care about
[SPEAKER_00]: the suffering of others and write them an
email or even phone call to your state or
[SPEAKER_00]: federal representative reminding them that
people are in need of this medicine and we
[SPEAKER_00]: want research for cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done such great work so far and
now we need to press for the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: research to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I want to talk about human rights
and the fact that we are all created
[SPEAKER_00]: equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about our right to choose
what medicine works best for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying all pharmaceuticals are
bad or harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying I should have the same
right to choose natural grown and made
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine as everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about the average everyday
person just trying to get by day by day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk about the average
person living with a serious illness in a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-legal state trying to make it day by
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about community that works
together to change laws and help each
[SPEAKER_00]: other out when we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: To show kindness and respect for each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here as a reminder that there are
people with certain illnesses that have no
[SPEAKER_00]: choice as to what medicine works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, as it turns out, is the only
thing known to man that successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: treats the rare brain disease I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be judged for it, not human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell as many people as you can that
cannabis is viable and important medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, vote for pro-cannabis choices and
contact your state and federal
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives and push them for federal
legalization and funding for research
[SPEAKER_00]: using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make this our best march ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for supporting this amazing
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really don't need a miracle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need is human understanding and
compassion to show up and light the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: a better tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate every one of you for
supporting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
