[SPEAKER_00]: All our supply chains are certified
organic and fair trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We super-fat our soaps with hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp seed imparts a real smoothness to the
lather, makes it less drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been fighting since 2001 to
re-commercialize industrial hemp farming
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just incredible that we can't grow
non-drug industrial hemp in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This country is the largest consumer
market for hemp seed and fiber products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to hand the largest market for
industrial hemp to the Canadians,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Chinese, to the Europeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a president who alleges that he
bases his policy on science and reason
[SPEAKER_00]: unlike his predecessor, but we have the
same drug warriors driving policy under
[SPEAKER_00]: this administration as the previous,
as every other administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an incredibly disappointing timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our family sponsored and successfully
fought off the DEA's attempt to shut off
[SPEAKER_00]: the imports of hemp seed oil 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Jack Harris' stroke in 2010,
me and some comrades dug up the DEA's lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: in Washington D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: and planted hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at that online just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are, the fourth year of Obama's
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still no hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I locked myself in a steel cage in front
of the White House and harvested 12 hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent three hours haranguing the
president, about 30 cops, and a huge crowd
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: About how ridiculous it is that our
government is making my family send over
[SPEAKER_00]: $100,000 every year to Canadians in the
middle of a recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: How retarded is it that we are still not
re-commercializing industrial hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our family also, we don't just concentrate
on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give a lot of money to Americans for
Safe Access, the primary group advocating
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just gave them $100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been supporting them from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just dropped $50,000 on the Colorado
legalization effort and on the Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we believe it's an earthquake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get the states to go,
if we can get Colorado and Washington to
[SPEAKER_00]: end cannabis prohibitions, it will be
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I realize there's
controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the larger picture is,
you know, don't let the perfect be the
[SPEAKER_00]: enemy of the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it'll be just such an
earthquake heard around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also just gave $100,000 to MAPS,
Multidisciplinary Association of
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelic Studies, an amazing group,
you know, working to re-commercialize,
[SPEAKER_00]: to integrate psychedelics, MDMA,
LSD, back into society in a responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, myself personally, and,
you know, a lot of people here have found
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and psychedelics to be huge
allies in our paths, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to help us be more compassionate and
conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge goal of Dr. Bronner's to,
yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're, you know,
our end game is, you know, we want in four
[SPEAKER_00]: years' time to put another zero on those
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're growing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a $5 million company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years ago, we're 50 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cap all executive compensation,
five to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't make any more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes back into movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all in God's faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
