[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where our numbers stand in
all of this initiative drive, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of up to each one of us to get out on
the street here and at least, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the people around us energized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, get some petition signed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's that time, we've got to get
it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a song for all the people who
love marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'd love you to take me with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swish me up a bud.
So I can rub this stuff.
Crank us up a loop.
We'll be rocking in the groove if you just
roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to get yourself up on this wave
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your heart beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your heart do the pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're speaking for this feeling,
so what the, what the, anyway?
Hey, don't ask us this.
Yes, we'd love you to take me with.
Swish me up a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can rub this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crank us up a loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be rocking in the deep, deep groove.
If you just roll it.
Swish me up a bud.
So I can rub this stuff.
Time
[SPEAKER_00]: to get yourself up on this wave length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your heart beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're speaking for this feeling,
so what the, what the, anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll us a spliff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'd love you to take me with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swish me up a bud.
So I can rub this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crank us up a loop.
