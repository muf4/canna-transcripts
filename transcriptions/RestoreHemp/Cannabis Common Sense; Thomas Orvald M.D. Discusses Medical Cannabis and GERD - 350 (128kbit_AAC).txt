[SPEAKER_00]: And tonight we're going to talk about a
strange disease called GERD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gastroesophageal reflux disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of people that have
this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very distressing because when you
swallow your food, normally you feel no
[SPEAKER_00]: untoward effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people who have GERD, they have severe
indigestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, indigestion is one thing,
but severe indigestion secondary to GERD
[SPEAKER_00]: has some ominous implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bear with me for just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to draw you a quick picture of
the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you swallow, food comes down the
esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes through a little valve that is
positioned right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that valve allows the food to go into
the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't allow any of the gastric
acid that's in the stomach that is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for breaking down the material
that you've swallowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, food comes down,
but it doesn't go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In people who have gastroesophageal reflux
disease, they have a valve that is
[SPEAKER_00]: non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as food hits the stomach,
the stomach agitates the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cells along the lining of the stomach
are called parietal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they secrete acid that helps break
down food products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's above the little valve here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same tissue as your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if acid from the stomach goes up into
the esophagus, it burns the esophagus,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like it would be if you poured acid
on your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is the flaw in gastroesophageal
reflux disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are surgical procedures that are
helpful in controlling this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many times, the symptoms themselves
can be ameliorated with the judicious use
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this area here is sedated,
is not functional, and acid gets flushed
[SPEAKER_00]: up into your esophagus, you experience the
burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can control that, the patient feels
a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, the cells that are
lining the esophagus right here are skin
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a long period of time, acid being
flushed up into those skin cell areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: burned can cause a bad problem called
cancer of the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer of the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the so-called Barrett's disease of
the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can discourage the ongoing flush
of acid into that area and discourage the
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, we have helped the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
