[SPEAKER_00]: Last night, in a dream, I interrogated
God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it the good die young?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the reason for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk, we argue, we cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did get any answer, but God knows
I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions already have an answer for
the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is it took the creation story,
claimed it, then took it apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: glorifying obedience and fear,
rampaging through the heart, stamping
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainty into the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's that original sin,
and something about the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've nothing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning was thought, and the
thought is to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that has to do.
An idiot.
Last night in a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the reason for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for anybody out there that gets what
we're doing, we really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get it, just put up with it,
right?
Thank you.
