[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can expand on why it's seen as a
good thing that the OLCC regulates
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana when presumably
they don't have any experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be particularly interested on the
consumption side of it as far as the
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the OLCC, you know, they have
experience with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have experience with licensing rules,
regulations, audits, sting operations,
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have experience dealing with,
you know, a relatively similar product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as all the government agencies go,
they just happen to be the best one for
[SPEAKER_01]: this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Health Authority, with some
experience dealing with medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: really made it clear that they only wanted
to stick with medical cannabis and didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to move into adult use over 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really didn't want to have an
antagonistic relationship with a
[SPEAKER_01]: government agency that didn't really want
the regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting a brand new regulation
unfortunately, there are startup costs
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you start off with the state
saying this brand new agency is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: cost $22 million a year, whether that's
true or not, that really puts you in a
[SPEAKER_01]: tough position to win the election.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the OLCC, you know, has experience with
these type of rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are definitely looking to be
educated from patients, consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the industry, how Washington and
Colorado is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're definitely looking to have,
you know, work groups around the various
[SPEAKER_01]: issues to educate themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the reasons why we give
the OLCC a full year to develop the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: and regulations so they have time to learn
about cannabis, bring in experts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and pass the, you know, common sense rules
and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things that was
impressive for me is ensuring that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have an agency that actually has some
expertise in regulations of substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, from my perspective, what New
Approach to Oregon was able to do is come
[SPEAKER_02]: together with an existing facility so you
would not find us needing to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: start from ground zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Anthony says, one of the things that is
very important to myself and many people
[SPEAKER_02]: that serve in the legislature is that we
do away with the black market or the
[SPEAKER_02]: underground market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by having the taxing structure that
they have placed in order to move forward
[SPEAKER_02]: actually will give us that best
opportunity to undercut.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen historically, when you look at
what happened with alcohol when it was
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibited and when it came back,
you can actually have the impact of
[SPEAKER_02]: undoing the cartel type of philosophies by
actually having a well-regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also believe that the OLCC, knowing my
discussions from the executive director,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not waiting until this passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already there, as Anthony says,
working and watching and seeing from those
[SPEAKER_02]: who are actually implementing in Colorado,
as well as what's happening now in
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, to be ready for what is going
to come forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess not saving grace, but I think
the part of having a deep breath and
[SPEAKER_02]: ensuring that we move forward in a
positive light is that there is a one-year
[SPEAKER_02]: incubation to actually have it up and
running.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clearly, I can tell you right now that
Steve Marks, who is the executive director
[SPEAKER_02]: of OLCC, has been on the phone with me,
and he has made it very clear that he's
[SPEAKER_02]: working with the Department of Ag as well
as the Oregon Health Authority because the
[SPEAKER_02]: measure itself deals not only with the
recreational part, but also brings forward
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the stuff I've worked on in
industrial hemp and also where you have
[SPEAKER_02]: the medical part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we'll get into some of the
questions that will go into greater detail
[SPEAKER_02]: why it's so important that this measure,
the new approach Oregon has put forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually calls out that we're going to
maintain a separate system for the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not going to be blended into the
retail, such as what has been discussed at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen to the Oregon medical
marijuana program if this passes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if OMMP continues, will there be
separate dispensaries for medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational purposes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess starting off from where
we're at, yes, I expect that there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: one OMMP is going to stay in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new approach measure, IP53,
calls that out distinctly, says it will
[SPEAKER_02]: stand alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The important part of that is because I
think the needs are very important for all
[SPEAKER_02]: of us to realize as to exactly what that
program was set up for and what it
[SPEAKER_02]: addresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fortunate to be able to help move
forward after the measure passed back in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had about 10 years that ran and
actually showed how the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: program was working, how efficient it was,
and how it was actually helping patients
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually get the relief they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing that and knowing that the citizens
actually passed that measure, which was,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I'm not mistaken, was ballot measure 67
back in 1998, what we basically have seen
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it has actually worked to the
point of where we wanted to give the
[SPEAKER_02]: patients in Oregon more control,
more assurance, and protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2009, I was able to get my
colleagues to actually support changing
[SPEAKER_02]: the scheduling of marijuana from a
schedule one, which is identified as
[SPEAKER_02]: having no medicinal purposes, to a
schedule two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we are one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the only state that I know that has
actually taken the step to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize what the people of this state
have said, that we believe it does have
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal purposes and use, and it should
be clarified and classified.
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a schedule two drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is something that,
for me, is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And clearly, as long as the federal
government is, let's say, behind in coming
[SPEAKER_02]: up where the people of this state and 20
other states in the District of Columbia
[SPEAKER_02]: are at, as it pertains to medical
marijuana, until they make the change from
[SPEAKER_02]: a schedule one to a schedule two,
we have to do everything we can to protect
[SPEAKER_02]: our patients in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've addressed this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could expand on what impact this
legal ization might have on the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my goal is to put it out of
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the reality is we have an
opportunity to have an industry become
[SPEAKER_02]: more legitimate and out from underneath
the rocks and from behind closed doors and
[SPEAKER_02]: alleyways and everything else,
to the point of where you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have a viable industry that's actually
going to be producing revenue that can go
[SPEAKER_02]: into the state general fund to pay for
education, human resource issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: health and wellness, as well as for public
safety needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do, in fact, think that you're
going to see the turning away and the
[SPEAKER_02]: drying up of the black market as it stands
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that you will, in fact, many of the
people I represent in the district I
[SPEAKER_02]: represent are looking forward of coming
out and being more public and being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually be a accountable for what they
do and not be behind the scenes and being
[SPEAKER_02]: concerned as to who might be knocking on
the doors, be it law enforcement or the
[SPEAKER_02]: bad guys trying to get in and take what
they're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that spans beyond
urban areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I represent a lot of rural areas of
Douglas Lane counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you that there are a lot of
people who have spoken to me about this
[SPEAKER_02]: topic and they think that this is
something that's right for the state and
[SPEAKER_02]: it will make us all better for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have the accountability and the
responsibilities will be in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we actually will see revenue
coming forward that will help us as a
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
