[SPEAKER_00]: 1959, many years ago, I was a sophomore in
medical school, and I was smitten by an
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate stroke of curiosity when I
read a selection in a textbook called
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodman and Gilman about cannabis,
which whetted my curiosity because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited, but medically, it sounded as
if it was pretty benign.
[SPEAKER_00]: This curiosity led me to read everything
in the medical school library,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then eventually permitted me to
infiltrate to the heart of the beast,
[SPEAKER_00]: the National Institute of Mental Health,
where I was hired as a research
[SPEAKER_00]: psychiatrist to study cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, cannabis was seen as a real
threat to society because in 1967,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was there, all hell was breaking
loose with Lyndon B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnson trying to keep up the pretext of
patriotism as he moved forward on the war
[SPEAKER_00]: in Vietnam, and the anti-war
demonstrations were just tremendous in
[SPEAKER_00]: scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish we would see these kinds of
protests again, but marijuana was seen as
[SPEAKER_00]: something dangerous that was being adopted
by subversive organizations like
[SPEAKER_00]: California communes, and they saw the end
of civilization coming near because the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal governance was breaking down as they
sent more and more young men off to be
[SPEAKER_00]: killed in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I came out to California
and ended up defecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There I fled and did my practice of
psychiatry until things started happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened starting in the Haight-Ashbury
and in the Castro in the response to the
[SPEAKER_00]: AIDS epidemic, where different kinds of
effective medicines were unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was discovered was cannabis would
prevent nausea and vomiting and permit the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of different kinds of medicines for
treating AIDS and the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this snowballed, and what started in
the Castro was taken under the wing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: political pros, and we went statewide,
and we passed proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years later, same kind of thing passed
up here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, I've had opportunities to
evaluate over 11,000 patients for their
[SPEAKER_00]: use of cannabis, and what has impressed me
is cannabis is both safe, effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a viable substitute for many
medications used to manage chronic illness
[SPEAKER_00]: that's far safer and free from adverse
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the forces of evil,
namely the greed of the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies coupled with the criminal
justice sorehead losers, don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: admit this to be a medicine and will do
everything they can to suppress it.
