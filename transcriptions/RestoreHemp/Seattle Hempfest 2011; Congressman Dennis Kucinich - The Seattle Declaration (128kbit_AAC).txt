[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me great pleasure to introduce to
you right now a champion of truth and
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the most honest politicians
we've had in my lifetime, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congressman Dennis Kucinich is here to
speak to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear a warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your love to Dennis Kucinich.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this day, in this place of great
beauty, we celebrate the beauty of nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm also here to celebrate the
wondrous nature of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence that we have here today binds
us as a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It empowers us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It strengthens us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must become visible en masse if we're
going to bring about the change that we
[SPEAKER_00]: want in the society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do that, we extend our reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring about new possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the creative spark that births action
can usher in a new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to say to America, open up
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time for mass action.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why and how recent movements for
freedom in Tunisia and Egypt gained
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how Gandhi cast off the British
Empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how America's suffragettes ended
up getting for women the right to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how Dr. Martin Luther King's March
on Washington became a pivotal moment in
[SPEAKER_00]: the civil rights history of this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: People become visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to the streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They link arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They march.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, we shall overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk the uplift path of social and
economic justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been on this path,
and it's time for us to begin to walk that
[SPEAKER_00]: path, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: People then march to glory, but not for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the benefit of generations to
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gather here today in a common
determination for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sense of commonality of purpose awakens.
[SPEAKER_00]: A purpose, a sense of awareness grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment arrives to exercise a new
commitment to cast off an old order of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This same awareness brought America's
founders to write the Declaration of
[SPEAKER_00]: Independence and to proclaim a new order
follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, it is not a financial deficit that
will bring America down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a deficit of public action.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people discover what happens,
when one person determines to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference and then merges with the many
like-minded, it becomes visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: New possibilities unfold, and a new order
follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Seattle, you understand it,
because in 1999, Seattle hosted the World
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade Organization rally, and Seattle was
the host to the Teamsters and the Turtles
[SPEAKER_00]: marching arm-in-arm, not too far from this
area, demanding, once and for all,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have enforceable workers' rights,
human rights, environmental quality
[SPEAKER_00]: principles in all of our trade agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They marched, and they chanted,
and they said, not only we shall overcome,
[SPEAKER_00]: but solidarity forever, solidarity for
workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Seattle WTO cast light upon the
workings of the WTO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattleites, union members, trade
activists, helped spark a worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness, helped spark a worldwide
awareness that workers had to have rights
[SPEAKER_00]: and that there had to be environmental
quality principles, and it was the people
[SPEAKER_00]: of Seattle who identified that child
labor, slave labor, and prison labor had
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in trade, that prohibitions on that
had to be in trade agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle brought that forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kept that alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've nurtured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large, intentional gatherings like this
one can be a catalyst for powerful change,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: As George Bernard Shaw once wrote,
to dream things that never were and ask
[SPEAKER_00]: why not, and let us dream about the
America that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us give our dreams some firmament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let our dreams and our thoughts become
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the words become deeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let our deeds become action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let our actions build a new America and a
new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle, you shook the world once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you shake it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready here, Seattle?
[SPEAKER_00]: To declare once and for all that it's time
for America to end the wars in Iraq,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Afghanistan, and Libya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared to demand that our troops
be brought home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared to demand that America
end its worldwide military presence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared to demand that America
must lead the way to nuclear abolition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared, Seattle, to demand that
we have to repeal the Patriot Act?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared, Seattle, to demand that
government spying, eavesdropping,
[SPEAKER_00]: and wiretapping of law-abiding citizens
must end?
[SPEAKER_00]: That our sister's right to privacy be
protected and decisions about women's
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive health be made between a
woman and her doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared, Seattle, to say that our
brothers and sisters who are gay,
[SPEAKER_00]: lesbian, bisexual, transgendered have all
full rights, including the right to marry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared, Seattle, to demand the
decriminalization and legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and demand hospitalization,
not incarceration, for those with broad
[SPEAKER_00]: problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared to demand not-for-profit
healthcare for all, education for all,
[SPEAKER_00]: retirement security for all, jobs for all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared to rescue our federal
government from corporate interests by
[SPEAKER_00]: calling for a constitutional amendment
which establishes only public financing of
[SPEAKER_00]: federal elections?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared to summon the energy to
rescue our planet, to protect our air,
[SPEAKER_00]: our water, and our land from further
exploitation by demanding an end to
[SPEAKER_00]: drilling the earth, cracking the earth,
cracking the earth, and an end to the
[SPEAKER_00]: poisoning of our seas and our skies,
and to make sure that we end this
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon-based solution and bring forward a
rapid transition to an environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly, socially responsible,
green economy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle, Seattle, this day, here and now,
you, through your responses, have voiced
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would call the Seattle Declaration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the sound of your voice today be heard
wide and far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your affirmations give birth to new
actions, a new nation, and a new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your voice once again cause America to
march.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your voice once again cause America to
sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your voice cause America to seek new
freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your voice call America to seek a new
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours is a restless quest for freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know wars make us less free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know fear makes us less free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social and economic insecurity makes us
less free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is for freedom's sake that we
gather, so then let us be for freedom's
sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: For freedom's sake that we act
courageously because it is our desire for
[SPEAKER_00]: change that carries extraordinary power to
become more than we are, better than we
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forged in a human heart, ignited by love
and a passion for transformation,
[SPEAKER_00]: our common unity, our common purpose,
and our common action can carry the power
[SPEAKER_00]: to change everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the power of human unity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the power of our oneness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Own it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act upon it, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congressman Dennis Kucinich, give a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
