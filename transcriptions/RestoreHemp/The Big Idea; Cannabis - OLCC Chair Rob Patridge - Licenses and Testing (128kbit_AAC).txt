[SPEAKER_00]: So Noel, we've had two years ago
Oregonians passed the measure that was
[SPEAKER_00]: measure 91 that made recreational
marijuana legal in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then we've had two legislative
sessions which substantially changed big
[SPEAKER_00]: portions of the bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Oregon Liquor Control Commission
was tasked originally with measure 91 to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate marijuana in Oregon and we've had
some major shifts and changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're on target to meet what our
goals were as we address the legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: with those as changes were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently there are about 407 licenses
that have been granted in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 50 of those licensees have not yet
paid here in the state of Oregon so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be licensed as soon as they pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those 357 licenses then that remain,
about 50 of those are retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about a half dozen of those that
are processors and then there's four
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have been licensed in the state of
Oregon and then the remainder of those are
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see we've got a big front-end
market going on and that's how we've tried
[SPEAKER_00]: at OLCC to try and prioritize things as
they move through the system because
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana that's going to be sold in the
recreational stores had to first be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: and then be processed or dried or whatever
form it's going to take and then be put
[SPEAKER_00]: out to retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're certainly on target on the
licensing parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly been some things
bouncing around and you've written about
[SPEAKER_00]: and others have written about and there's
been articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you re-test those a little bit for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the things that the
issues that have come up?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big issues that we're hearing
about really is the testing that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon put a pretty rigorous testing
program in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that there is a lot of the
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is on the flower side of marijuana,
I don't think that there has been a large
[SPEAKER_00]: issue related to testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of that product has been able
to move to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on the processing side of
marijuana, the oils and the other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are substantial costs that I don't
think some of the people were prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testing methods and the amount that
had to be tested were not anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Liquor Control Commission
doesn't control what those tests have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the Oregon Health Authority is
the one who controls what those are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they went out to third party groups to
get that testing regimen and it's tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is that it's tested just
like other food and agricultural products
[SPEAKER_00]: that move through the system, but it's
expensive and we're trying to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: that capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: OLCC, when the market came to us,
we convened with OHA and the governor's
[SPEAKER_00]: office and tried to meter out some of the
capacity that exists in the pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: testing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get our arms around it,
but when you go from a system that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of testing really, that was
regimented testing, now, and you saw your
[SPEAKER_00]: first reports I think this week related to
some product failing on the Oregon Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Authority side that actually got out to
patients, it's problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slowing down that process to some
degree, but I think we're all trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're convening and talking to the market
and trying to be flexible, but at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time, protect public safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
