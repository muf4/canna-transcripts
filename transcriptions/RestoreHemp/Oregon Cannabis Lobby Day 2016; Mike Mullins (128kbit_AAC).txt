[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon and thank you everyone for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important beginning of a
session for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all important that we all be
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Mike Mullins and I'm with
Stoney Girl Gardens, Stoney only
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and we have our Portland,
Amsterdam University.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I'm not here to talk about my
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to talk about my right to
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to talk about my right as a
patient to qualified medicine and to have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to that medicine wherever I live in
the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shame that we now have gone
backwards and gone back to putting
[SPEAKER_00]: patients on the east side of our state and
in many other areas and denied them
[SPEAKER_00]: access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those patients cannot afford to
grow for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them patients cannot do for
themselves whatsoever and depend on people
[SPEAKER_00]: such as myself to be a caregiver and a
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately we're hearing stories that
this has become so over-regulated and so
[SPEAKER_00]: costly that our patients are going to lose
access to qualified medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already lost access to the places
where they used to get their qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michaela would never have gotten her
medicine in a Hermiston store if it were
[SPEAKER_00]: closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's alive today because she was able to
access that medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that first of all cannabis is
medicine and to attest to that fact I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you that our healthcare industry is
the largest ones in the state of Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: who provide the health insurance for all
of the people who are in this building
[SPEAKER_00]: have already approached us and are looking
for an integrated path to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutics because their doctors know
that cannabis is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is is that they've already
approached us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already looking for an avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already given them a five-year
integration path to be able to utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: this for their own purposes to recommend
it to the patients as they are now doing
[SPEAKER_00]: through licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is is that our lawmakers and our
need to know that they have never been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to legislate the black market and
that trying to do it now will accomplish
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing but reinforce the black market
that we've worked so hard to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to say I'm very proud of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the second oldest state in the
nation to have a medical marijuana program
[SPEAKER_00]: and have one of the most successful
medical marijuana programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate that the lawmakers in
their fury and are trying to push
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have one thing to say to our
legislators and that is instead of taking
[SPEAKER_00]: this program back to prohibition and
creating failure they should be focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: building the success of Oregon's future in
the advantage that we may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
