[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's reasonable to talk about the
malady that most of our patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: complaining of in the clinic, and that is
back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are a lot of reasons for back
pain, but by far the most frequent reason
[SPEAKER_00]: for discomfort is degenerative disc
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you all know that at one time,
at least most of us believe, that at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time we were swinging in the trees and we
ultimately came down and stood up on our
[SPEAKER_00]: hind legs, and this was one of the
problems that encountered the problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: disc problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stand in a vertical position,
you have vertebral bodies that have shock
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbers between them, which are called
discs, and I'll show you a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: diagram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are vertebral bodies, and in between
the vertebral bodies as shock absorbers we
[SPEAKER_00]: have discs, and this just gives you an
idea of what our problems are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the discs are, as we said,
shock absorbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very thick and fibrous around the
periphery, and very tough, but as time
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on, as we age, we start to have
degenerative problems in the disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a disc looking down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside is fibrous tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside, strangely enough, is
gelatinous, so it's like jello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what happens to these discs as they
degenerate is, in some cases, they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: weak spot and they bulge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they bulge, they have a tendency to
cause pressure on nerves that originate
[SPEAKER_00]: from this area, and it can cause pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem is when one of these
ruptures, it actually breaks open,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this gelatinous material is forced out
and sits outside in this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and once again causes pressure on these
nerve roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the thing that we see with most
frequency, and there are many ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: treating this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I am surgically oriented,
I am most happy with a surgical approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not always possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we can treat them surgically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can treat them with some injections of
lidocaine, or material that will decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, but we end up, most of the time,
using our proverbial cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis helps these people incredibly
with handling their discomfort,
[SPEAKER_00]: and once again, this is the thing that we
see with most frequency in our clinics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you, Dr. Roy.
