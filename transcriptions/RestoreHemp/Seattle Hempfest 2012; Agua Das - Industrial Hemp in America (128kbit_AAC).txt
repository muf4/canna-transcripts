[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're on the verge of some very
exciting changes and people's awareness is
[SPEAKER_01]: growing steadily.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to have hemp agriculture in the
United States, we've been working on a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of projects so that we can hit the
ground running when we have hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on developing processes and
products so that we are ready to have hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with materials that were
grown in Canada and we're using these to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop these processes because we do not
want to hold our breath waiting for
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody to change a law.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't bet on an uncertainty but there
are certain parts of it that are quite
[SPEAKER_01]: certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organically grown in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get hemp herds by the bale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can transport them without restriction
to our research centers here in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all materials that are certified
non-controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking with a number of
agricultural research stations who are
[SPEAKER_01]: very interested in working with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pressing oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing the same processes and analyses to
analyze hemp seed oil to compare them with
[SPEAKER_01]: the canola oil and the sunflower oil and
the soybean oil that are being used to
[SPEAKER_01]: make biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out that hemp seed oil with all
those double bonds in it stays liquid at
[SPEAKER_01]: lower temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problems of biodiesel is that
it tends to gel in cool weather so hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: seed oil biodiesel is more resistant to
gelling in cold weather with all those all
[SPEAKER_01]: those EFAs all those polyunsaturated fats
they stay liquid even at freezer
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a bottle of hemp seed oil when you
get it at the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put it in the refrigerator put it in
the freezer and watch it still stays
[SPEAKER_01]: pourable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other oil will do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at how how do we prepare for
hemp agriculture on a scale that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: truly make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real farmer may not take a crop
seriously if he cannot grow 500 acres of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we need in order to be ready
for a 500 acre crop of hemp seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Making the assumption that you get a
hundred fold increase with each crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The year before we need to have a five
acre seed crop dedicated to producing the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed for our 500 acre crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The year before that you need five
hundredths of an acre which is roughly 20
[SPEAKER_01]: foot by 20 foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the year before that you need a
hundredth of that which is two foot by two
[SPEAKER_01]: foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means that we are four years away
from selecting one plant that meets our
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to having enough seed to where you
can have a 500 acre crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to move forward in ways where we
build on our foundations and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared for the successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandmother always said success is what
happens when preparation meets an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've spent much of my life
preparing for various successes that have
[SPEAKER_01]: shown their face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is yet another one.
