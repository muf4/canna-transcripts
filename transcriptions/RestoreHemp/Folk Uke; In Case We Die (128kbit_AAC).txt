[SPEAKER_00]: Of all the world, dear, you are the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite human under the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: What brings tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: We never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd better kiss me before you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's you and me, dear, among all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sooner or later, there is goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kiss me once more, dear, in case we
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Death could be waiting outside of this
room, anticipating yours and my potential
[SPEAKER_00]: doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be walking, trip on our own feet,
not even to mention all the psychos we
[SPEAKER_00]: meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sooner or later, there is goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kiss me once more, dear, in case we
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a solo for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither do I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could think of something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just take it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just strumming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to screw that one up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it out of key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Death could be waiting outside of this
room, anticipating yours and my potential
[SPEAKER_00]: doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be walking, trip on our own feet,
not even to mention all the psychos we
[SPEAKER_00]: meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sooner or later, there is goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kiss me once more, dear, in case we
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss me once more, dear, in case we die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
