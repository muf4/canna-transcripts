[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bear in mind that that's our former
police chief that you heard taking that
[SPEAKER_00]: position, by the way, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it's great to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really exciting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very optimistic about Prop 19
passing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start off by saying what the state
of California law is, to give you a grasp
[SPEAKER_00]: of where things stand right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, marijuana is illegal in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a qualified, limited immunity
that people have if they get a doctor's
[SPEAKER_00]: approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an immunity that allows them,
theoretically, to have eight ounces or six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and be immune from arrest if they
have the right paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, they're in court fighting it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, the problem is the
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cop doesn't like the doctor,
doesn't believe it's done in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever their issues are that they have
against the paperwork becomes a big factor
[SPEAKER_00]: in this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Prop 215 created the limited qualified
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: SB 420 created an opportunity for
collectives to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also set up the safe harbor for
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, it created a legal defense
against sales of marijuana, which right
[SPEAKER_00]: now we have this dispensary system in
California, which is not based upon them
[SPEAKER_00]: saying it's legal to sell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to say that if you get it busted,
that you have a legal defense in court for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, it is a felony to furnish
people below the age of 18 in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a misdemeanor to possess marijuana,
to transport marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a felony to cultivate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That felony can be mitigated by a PC-1000
deferred entry of judgment, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that if the judge is nice to you,
that you might be able to get out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: without having a permanently scarred
record other than having been arrested
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can dispose of the PC,
excuse me, of your cultivation bust.
[SPEAKER_00]: As was mentioned earlier here,
something like 56% of Californians think
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana should be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the poll in what we have
right now, the average of the last seven
[SPEAKER_00]: polls comes to 51.3% who are in favor of
the initiative as written.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this means is that our opponents
are now in the position where they will
[SPEAKER_00]: say that they're not in favor of the drug
war.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in favor of marijuana being
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just think this is the wrong
initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they will give you two reasons of
why they think it is wrong or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make up fake stuff as much as
they want, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to pass on that for a moment
and get back to that in a minute because
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want to go to next is how do we
arrive at Prop 19 in the form that is
[SPEAKER_00]: written right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The origins and concept come from the fact
that there were four initiatives that were
[SPEAKER_00]: being crafted in California last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was California Cannabis
Initiative, which was a full legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other was the California Hampton
Health Initiative, Jack Harris Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one was called the Common Sense
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of guys in Long Beach who just
said it's time to do something and they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know or they didn't have a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wrote something that said it's
common sense to legalize marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: so therefore we should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it was their initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Proposition 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you notice, only one of those is
called Proposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because of the four, one made it
onto the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife, Mickey Norris, here, who's a
co-publisher of the West Coast Leaf with
[SPEAKER_00]: me, she and I were engaged in the writing
of three of those initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what people said to us, so which one
do you support?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we said is we support the one
that gets on the ballot because the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, you know, they're great ideas,
maybe, but they're not on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seems pretty clear to me how you
have to address that kind of a situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, not everyone felt about it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm here to tell you that this
initiative was very, very, very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very carefully written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was initiated from material that was
put together by criminal lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it went to constitutional lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it went to election lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a group of citizens,
such as myself and Mickey, and many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders of the movement were invited to
participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said they did not want to because
they felt this was the wrong year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they held off for two years,
then they would get involved, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we took the different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, if there's something on the
ballot, I want to have something to input
[SPEAKER_00]: on what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then a lot of people are resentful
to us because of, well, how come we were
[SPEAKER_00]: consulted and they weren't?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is because we took the time
and went to the meetings and they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those meetings were extremely
interesting because this initiative was
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to do several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to preserve the existing medical
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The attorneys had told us originally,
as long as you don't mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said, as long as we didn't mention
the medical marijuana laws, that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as we didn't put them in the
section that says, these are the laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: are changed, it would not be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we said, that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in the purposes three times that it
protects the medical marijuana laws in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the ballot argument, it says one
time that we're preserving those laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that it's changing those is
completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was written to protect the medical
marijuana laws and, in fact, to go beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: it because the current medical marijuana
laws do not make it clear that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: sell medical marijuana, whereas Prop 19
says you can sell marijuana if the city
[SPEAKER_00]: authorizes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question of the dispensaries
will be resolved clearly that you can sell
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in California for medical uses
after Prop 19 passes, which is not clear
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still being fought out in courts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that it's a modest
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than legalizing unlimited amounts
of marijuana for anybody to use all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time in any place and share with anybody
of any age, they wrote something that said
[SPEAKER_00]: it limits to one ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have an affirmative defense if you
have more than an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legislature can increase the
quantity as available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legislature can continue to make
further changes to improve the initiative
[SPEAKER_00]: by reducing penalties and reducing
restrictions, but not by going the other
[SPEAKER_00]: way, not by adding new penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't give them that authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also makes a very small personal
grow legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means changed during the course
of our discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, it was a reasonable amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it became maybe 100 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it went down to 50 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it went down to 32 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found out is that the people
who don't grow marijuana think that that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Richard came to the 25 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legislature can increase that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, I was very against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that with the affirmative
defense that you can defend bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not really going to be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just means that if you can stay
within 25 square feet, you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is that it allows
local regulations without putting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: state law that regulates the sales of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what our constitutional lawyers
told us we had to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said if we made a law that California
had to break federal law, that that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be ruled unconstitutional immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can do is say that the state is
stepping aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to allow the cities to do
the same kind of regulation that they do
[SPEAKER_00]: over the gas station, the barbershop,
the grocery store, the drugstore,
[SPEAKER_00]: the liquor store, the tobacco outlets,
the same kind of regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that offended a lot of
people because they felt like marijuana is
[SPEAKER_00]: not supposed to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our sense of what we got to through
the polls was this, that the voters were
[SPEAKER_00]: in favor of legalization, but they don't
like the alcohol model because they think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not controlled well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted more controls over marijuana
than over alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might say, well, marijuana is
safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what the voters want to
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to hear that we have written a
law that produces more controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those controls were put in there
specifically to do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them being that it would make 18 to
20 years old equal, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: sales or transfers to people between the
ages 18 and 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept all the criminal penalties for
sales to minors below 18 and 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those remained intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as they always have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no new felony in this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it did do is it made it tougher
penalty for selling to people between the
[SPEAKER_00]: ages 18 and 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made it equivalent to the alcohol model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said that we have to keep it away
from kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did it in kind of an ambiguous way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said it doesn't legalize smoking around
people around minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't make a new penalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't change the law about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said that it didn't specifically make
it legal to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, so you still have your
misdemeanor furnishing charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the medical, it's still protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're distributing to people under
the age of between 18 and 21, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have possibly a prison time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a guaranteed prison time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, jail time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no prison time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not create any prison time at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that people were
concerned about, let me reiterate that,
[SPEAKER_00]: no prison time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that's going to come back
and haunt me, the fact that I said the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong word.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that it works in this
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the financial argument resonates very
well, although people don't really expect
[SPEAKER_00]: it to pay off the way it sounds like it
will because they removed the lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't pay off the way they thought
it was going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug cartel argument is extremely
powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the fact that 60% of the drug
cartels in Mexico's money, and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there were more cartels being abused here,
but I'm just going to go with the common
[SPEAKER_00]: usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug cartels in Mexico had about 60%
of the money from selling marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if we take the California market away
from them, that that's going to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: their ability to slaughter people in
Mexico and to do that kind of criminality
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are really concerned about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two things that are really
important to California is that they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want people driving under the influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want people in the
workplace smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is in an initiative it
protects the employer's right to say what
[SPEAKER_00]: people can do on the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It protects the federal drug-free
workplace laws, which, by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't change federal law anyway,
as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also makes sure that the
driving under the influence laws are
[SPEAKER_00]: intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it preserves those because,
again, you can argue that people may drive
[SPEAKER_00]: safer on marijuana than other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But voters don't want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to hear that people are not
going to be driving under the influence of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana any more than they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the way the law was
written based upon polls.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we were looking for is the middle
ground, in other words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're getting hit from both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's talk about that for the next
moment here, which is that we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: backlash we were expecting from the right
wing, which is that they say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is creating a situation and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marijuana is this great danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people begin driving under the
influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are going to be smoking at
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had dealt with all that within the
initiative itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of their claims don't have a lot
of traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you actually read the initiative,
only if you don't read the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we were not necessarily
expecting was that Dennis Perrone and
[SPEAKER_00]: another group, a woman called Dragon Fart
or something like that, is out there
[SPEAKER_00]: making up false stories about the
initiative and spreading it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not really counting on that
because we were hoping for this what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call, we're doing 51.3% with what they
call the likely voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want the unlikely voters out there
too, the young people who aren't expected
[SPEAKER_00]: to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it's going to be important
for the Democrats and for the progressive
[SPEAKER_00]: agenda in general to have this happen as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, so just to basically say
it, there are no new felonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do basically anything that they
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the new issue of the West Coast
Leaf, we did an investigation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: claims that were made by those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go on forever, though,
because they can make up conspiracy
[SPEAKER_00]: stories like you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can spend your whole life trying
to dispute their conspiracy theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we looked at the things that they said
were likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out that basically it was all
wrong what they had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the historical context is that
this is 38 years since California had
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing non-medical marijuana on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coincidentally or inextricably,
it's the same ballot number, Proposition
[SPEAKER_00]: 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, the big funders have not
come through with the money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to count upon people like John
said for here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you could take one month's
supply of money that you spend on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and give a third of it to
normal, a third of it to Prop 19,
[SPEAKER_00]: a third to Prop 74, that would be an
extremely good use of your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, I would say that
you have the information here to donate to
[SPEAKER_00]: the campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the West Coast Leaf gives you a
full rundown on how these things look and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that Prop 215 is the best
thing that happened to California since
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Prop 19 passes, it is going to far,
far surpass anything that Proposition 215
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need every one of you out there
telling people in California, register,
[SPEAKER_00]: vote, get people to vote absentee,
get them out to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to win on November the 2nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get everybody out on behalf of
legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it lawful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just a legal defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This law says it is lawful for people to
possess, cultivate, and use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the difference because that's
the beginning of the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: discrimination, which is all based upon it
being illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
