[SPEAKER_00]: So the political mantra this season is
jobs, jobs, jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hearing at least Democratic
candidates everywhere in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went down to the picnic at the Labor
Temple in Madison last Monday,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know that's always full of
political candidates chasing the union
[SPEAKER_00]: vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I caught members of the
legislature where we'd had a half bill
[SPEAKER_00]: clear the Agriculture Committee with a
comfortable margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never got a floor vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you guys are talking jobs,
jobs, jobs, let me show you some jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled out these cards, come and
grab one, with a photo of the employees of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Fairwater Hemp Company of Fairwater,
Wisconsin in 1917.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Fairwater Hemp Company has another
unique place in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first place the hemp was ever
used as an energy crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the Grand River was the Fairwater
Water Wheel, the largest of its kind,
[SPEAKER_00]: generating electric power for the nearby
villages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as demand grew, as they got more
distribution line laid, there came a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where in the fall, during the dry season,
there wasn't enough hydropower to supply
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole customer base they'd built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the owner of the water wheel was the
son-in-law of the guy who owned a hat mill
[SPEAKER_00]: across the river, and he noticed his
father-in-law had this kiln that was
[SPEAKER_00]: burning all of the waste products of their
rope manufacturer, the herds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, let's get a steam engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the dry fall months, for at least
two years, the villages of Fairwater and
[SPEAKER_00]: Markison and surrounding countryside were
indeed powered by hemp for electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my belief that at this point,
until we get really good technology for
[SPEAKER_00]: making liquid fuels from low-density,
solid biomass like hemp stalks,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we really will actually be seeing
hemp playing a role in electric generation
[SPEAKER_00]: before it's really viable as a liquid
fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that you can't grow enough
biomass, it's that the conversion to the
[SPEAKER_00]: high-density liquid that you can haul
around in a car is still very energy
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Donnie and I were first talking
about this stuff in 1992, the lab guys
[SPEAKER_00]: were saying, oh, cellulose to ethanol is
right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's turned out to be a very soft
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are closer, but I'm not going to
say it's something happening as fast as we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get the laws on hemp change.
