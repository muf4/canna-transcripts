[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Andrea Herman and I've come to
Oregon State University as a co-lecturer
[SPEAKER_00]: for WSE 266 eCampus course on industrial
hemp underneath the College of Forestry's
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable materials section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last couple of days I've learned
that here in Oregon there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: press board factories and of course since
you have ample amounts of wood here but
[SPEAKER_00]: we're also focusing on how we can change
the dynamics of how we're using those wood
[SPEAKER_00]: products and looking at what other
products we can incorporate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I've learned that there's been a
decline in the need for the grass seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production here so that opens up acreage
for hemp cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have companies here that are
already milling products into powders and
[SPEAKER_00]: food grade products so that's something
that Oregon can readily pick up and
[SPEAKER_01]: include in their production and market
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think here in Oregon particularly you
know you want to call up Senator Wyden and
[SPEAKER_00]: Merkley's office and tell them thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you're a constituent
and that you care about this issue and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them know if you do have any concerns
about industrial hemp in your area and
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond that if you have family and it's in
any other state call them talk with them
[SPEAKER_00]: start talking about this at lunch at the
supper table make that communication flow
[SPEAKER_00]: start to open up and I think we're never
going to have that federal bill passed
[SPEAKER_00]: unless people voice their opinions so like
I say if your if your senator is already a
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor call them and say thank you if
they're not a sponsor call them and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them know and don't just call once call
more than once have your family your
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues your husband your kids make the
phone call the more phone calls we make
[SPEAKER_00]: the better and the more difference it will
end up making in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give up yeah don't give up I think
you know I mean for me this is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know was a dream for me I felt
passion and I had a lot of desire to see
[SPEAKER_00]: where hemp was going to go it became a
passion it became my dream it became a
[SPEAKER_00]: goal internally and externally and
fortunately enough I stuck with it and and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's led me down this path so I
hope that other people will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow in my path and through this course
being offered at OSU it's really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: open the opportunity for people to really
follow their dream academia wise and then
[SPEAKER_00]: be producing professionals coming out of
the universities that are ready to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp marketplace and provide
background and institutional knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: that otherwise we don't have right now in
the sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
