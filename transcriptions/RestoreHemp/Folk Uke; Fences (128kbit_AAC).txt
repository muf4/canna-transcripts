[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way you hurt me without trying
And the way you speak to me with your
[SPEAKER_02]: embrace Sometimes when you're asleep and I
am crying I can just make out the smile
[SPEAKER_02]: across your face Crashing cars,
loving you and busting fences Destructive
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I've been known to do So if I
never do come to my senses This reckless
[SPEAKER_00]: heart will go on loving you, loving you
I'd rather be a broken heart that's
[SPEAKER_00]: running Along a road that's sure to take
me down Than a heart that's never broke
[SPEAKER_00]: but knows it's right It's coming We were
born to love and love is trouble bound
[SPEAKER_02]: Crashing cars, loving you and busting
fences Destructive things that I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: known to do So if I never do come to my
senses This reckless heart will go on
[SPEAKER_02]: loving you, loving you What
[SPEAKER_01]: happens when my ego takes over?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't go on living Can't go on dying I'm
feeling blue Can't get over you There's no
[SPEAKER_02]: use in trying I never tried and I don't
want to Someday when I am wise my mind may
[SPEAKER_02]: wander To a better place, another point of
view Maybe then I'll have the time to sit
[SPEAKER_02]: and ponder And that's what I'll do When
I'm through I'll go back to crashing cars,
[SPEAKER_02]: loving you and busting fences Destructive
things that I've been known to do So if I
[SPEAKER_02]: never do come to my senses This reckless
heart will go on loving you, loving you,
[SPEAKER_02]: loving you Wow!
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you!
