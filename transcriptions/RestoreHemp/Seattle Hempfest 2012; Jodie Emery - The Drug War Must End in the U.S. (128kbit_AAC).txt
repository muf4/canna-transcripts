[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm going to bring up Jodie
Emery, the incredible wife of Mark Emery,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's serving time in a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: federal penitentiary for selling seeds
over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a disgrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: No seeds ever hurt anybody in the history
of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an incredible, tireless campaigner
for her husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an incredible activist and a
tremendous person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up to Jodie Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Vivian, and thank you
so much to HempFest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my fourth year here, and every
year I am filled with hope because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: our movement is winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're here in the world's largest
cannabis celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people worldwide right now who
are so envious of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would give anything to come to
Seattle HempFest, and you're lucky enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to be here because there are tireless
activists working day in and day out all
[SPEAKER_01]: year long to make this happen for you for
free to attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you owe it to everybody here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give a dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've all got at least a dollar,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please donate to HempFest because this
event is free to attend, to speak about
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom, but it's not free to put on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So show them a little gratitude for that
when you leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband's name is Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was called the Prince of Pot by CNN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Rolling Stone and Wall Street
Journal, media all over the world covered
[SPEAKER_01]: my husband because he did something no one
else would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1994, Mark Emery decided to start
selling marijuana seeds to people
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide, no matter where you lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the United States, California
passed medical marijuana laws,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there was a need for medicine in the
form of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my husband decided to be brave to sell
those seeds to Americans and people
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only did Mark Emery, the Prince of
Pot, provide millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana seeds to people worldwide to
grow their own medicine and save their own
[SPEAKER_01]: lives, but he promised that every dollar
spent on those seeds would go to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He financed ballot initiatives for medical
marijuana in Colorado, Washington DC,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada, Arizona, Alaska, many places where
it passed or failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark helped make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark founded the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Party.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a Canadian citizen.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never even left Canada, but he knew the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is where the drug war begins and where it
must end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he financed the marijuana movement with
millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the money from those seeds went to
activism in this country, in this state,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this city and places worldwide to help
the activists on the ground become leaders
[SPEAKER_01]: in their own right and take forward the
torch of victory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mark Emery was the most famous
activist for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, plant the seeds of freedom to
overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are today where the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: has made so much progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beacon of hope for the rest of the
world because the drug war started here
[SPEAKER_01]: and it spreads around the world like a
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills people with the drug war in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills people worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It imprisons people, ruins families,
takes away fathers from their little
[SPEAKER_01]: babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts people who hurt no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You aren't hurting anyone, but the law is
designed to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, like my husband and every other
activist, taking a stand, owe it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people in prison and the people who died
to change this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Washington this November,
legalization is on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote yes on I-502 for legal stores selling
legal marijuana to protect you from going
[SPEAKER_01]: to prison and to send a message worldwide
that we need freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And legalization starts here so it can
then spread throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my husband, who was imprisoned for his
activism, the DEA admitted it was all
[SPEAKER_01]: about the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tracked all the money and they said,
yeah, he gave it all away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave it all away to political activists
and campaigns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Emery was a threat to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: drug war and that's why they took him
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They brought him into this country when he
never even came here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Emery, the principal, is a Canadian
who planted the seeds of freedom to
[SPEAKER_01]: overgrow the government, to save people's
lives, and he's a hero like all the heroes
[SPEAKER_01]: in prison because of this drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we owe it to them because you're here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're free today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: You owe it to all of those people
suffering worldwide to change this,
[SPEAKER_01]: to legalize marijuana and prohibition and
support everybody who's taking action to
[SPEAKER_01]: make that happen today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you Seattle Hemfest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This smoke signal goes worldwide and it
should be followed by yes on I-502,
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization this November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote yes, make a difference, save lives,
and legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dodie Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband is Mark Emery, the prince of
bombs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
