[SPEAKER_00]: This is, let me get you to close in just a
little bit farther, camera two,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is old money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 1914 series $10 bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you note that it's Andrew
Jackson, who today is on the $20 bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way back then, he was on the $10 bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the signature of the Secretary of
Treasury right here is Andrew Mellon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can get you to close in kind of
on a half bill there on camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Mellon was the head of Standard
Oil, what is today ExxonMobil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and was the world's largest oil company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was his first stint as Secretary of
Treasury.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the Secretary of Treasury for five
different presidents, between Woodrow
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson to Herbert Hoover.
[SPEAKER_00]: He controlled a lot of the Treasury
Department, a lot of economic policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: also the head of Mellon Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a nephew, and his nephew was Harry
Anslinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harry Anslinger was the first head of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
started in 1931.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in place until 72, when under
Richard Nixon, they changed the Federal
[SPEAKER_00]: Bureau of Narcotics to the Drug
Enforcement Administration in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substances Act of 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Harry Anslinger is the father of hemp
and cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one who made up the reefer
madness stories and said it caused people
[SPEAKER_00]: to go insane and kill their family and
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Andrew Mellon was the head,
as I said, of Standard Oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Mexico, in 1911, there was a
revolution, as many of you may know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pancho Villa led the revolution,
and they overthrew the Mexican government
[SPEAKER_00]: and established a new government that
continues today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pancho Villa's soldiers had a
revolutionary war song called La
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucaracha.
[SPEAKER_00]: La Cucaracha, in one line in La Cucaracha,
says that the cockroach, which is what La
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucaracha is, the cockroach, smokes
marijuana and then falls down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Pancho Villa, when they became the
revolutionary leaders and took over the
[SPEAKER_00]: government of Mexico, they nationalized
the oil industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the oil industry magnates,
such as Andrew Mellon here, did not like
[SPEAKER_00]: that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he is the one who directed,
actually the first marijuana laws in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country were enacted in 1914, right about
the time this $10 bill was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this $10 Federal Reserve note is
printed on 100% hemp paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is made out of hemp paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, close in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back even larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it even larger, because I'm going to
flip this thing over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows what's on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see industries, which are really
important, but even more important,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see them harvesting hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: See those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are hemp bundles on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Don Skakie pointed out a couple of
weeks ago, it's right there on the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is this made out of hemp fiber,
it shows hemp harvesting on the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this bill in particular has a lot of
historical notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful bills done, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the artwork is just stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right on the money, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that enlarged on your HD screens at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they march into Congress and make
all these silly laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this bill is particularly historic in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great teaching tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I decided to bring it back and
talk about those various aspects of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis prohibition.
