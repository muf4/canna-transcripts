[SPEAKER_00]: It really blows my mind to understand that
this war started a hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearst started their false propaganda,
the lies, renamed the plant hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: renamed the plant cannabis, and called it
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he lost a lot of timber to the
Mexicans, he wasn't too happy with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but California started the law in 1913.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several states followed quickly,
and before you knew it, the conglomerate
[SPEAKER_00]: of the industrial complex had managed to
pass a bill that was the marijuana tax act
[SPEAKER_00]: of 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was proven unconstitutional by 1969,
and Nixon didn't have much time to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: this law going, so he gathered his
conservative friends to give him advice
[SPEAKER_00]: and find nasty things to say about this
plant, but they found the opposite as
[SPEAKER_00]: usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found it does not have it forming,
it does not lead to other drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't do any of the things that they
said they do, and so he didn't like that
[SPEAKER_00]: report.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tore it up, threw it in the garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the Schaeffer Commission report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schaeffer Commission report, but here's
the tragedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually the only federal law,
you law enforcement, listen carefully,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you took an oath to uphold that
constitution too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lie, which disrespects my fourth and
fifth amendment rights, that lie that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kept me from getting a job since the 80s,
so now I live with a miserable income and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to support me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same lie has put over 20 million of
us under arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one time or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how many of us are there here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people smoke marijuana in this
country?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the percentage of what you arrest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 1%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 10%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 4%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whatever you think it is,
multiply that by 25 million and you might
[SPEAKER_00]: get a clue, a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we forced to follow, this is the
federal law they try to put on the states
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone else, to follow the legacy of
a man who left the presidency in disgrace
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the main reasons I'm asking
everybody to vote for 80, to vote to help
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in Colorado, in Michigan,
and send a clear message to the
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will not be tolerated any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there are millions of us
breaking your law every day, has no
[SPEAKER_00]: respect for us, it doesn't deserve
respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now change it, please change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote on 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in other states, help those
ones in Colorado and Michigan and
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely contact your legislators and
your president and remind them that this
[SPEAKER_00]: man changed these laws all by himself with
no help from the Congress or the Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just an order that he gave that
we're living under this lie and this lie
[SPEAKER_00]: has to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five generations of lies and
misinformation has rendered us a nation
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very incapable of making rational
decisions, mostly because our system is
[SPEAKER_00]: not satisfied, the endocannabinoid system
that opens our mind and expands our
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking and allows us to be real human
beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
