[SPEAKER_00]: The other day, I was on a TV program when
the moderator came on, he looked into the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera and said, while other candidates
for governor are running on better schools
[SPEAKER_00]: and more roads, Gangwood Gap was running
on legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hold it right there,
Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get something straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like these other candidates,
I envision better schools and I envision
[SPEAKER_00]: more roads and I envision delivery of
health care to the rural areas and feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: our hungry and housing our homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference between me and these
other candidates is that I figured out a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to pay for it without putting it on
the shoulders of the already overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: First day in office, I'm going to ground
every helicopter the state of Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: owns.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not going to be helicopters ever
going over the fields and gardens of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people of the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is America, not Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not an occupied territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is obscene if we have 66 out of
Kentucky's 120 counties that can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: afford to educate their own children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the Kentucky public is sending out
hundreds of millions of dollars and the
[SPEAKER_00]: American public is sending out billions of
dollars in tax-free income to the
[SPEAKER_00]: international criminal syndicates in South
America and Mexico for a plant my
[SPEAKER_00]: granddaddy used to grow by the thousands
of acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to redirect that money out
of the hands of these international
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal syndicates and I'm going to put a
million of them into the capital tax
[SPEAKER_00]: coffers of Frankfurt so I can lift the
people of Kentucky out of poverty and out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the misery and out of these last
places.
I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to redirect this money but I'm going
to redefine the role of government in
[SPEAKER_00]: policing private behavior in the state of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in a police state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave here, go out and get in your
car and they can set up a random roadblock
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of you, make you get out of your
car, bring a dog up to sniff you,
[SPEAKER_00]: your car and all his belongings take blood
out of the yard and make you pee in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle and stick their hands where the sun
don't shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a police state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a police state on the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's ride these horses down the trail and
they drop the log in front of us and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: John, get off that horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take blood out of the yard
and got to pee in this bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick our fingers up your
butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think John Wayne would say, I'm afraid
not, pilgrim.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I draw my line in the sand
and this is where we're drawing the line
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to turn privacy and individual
dignity and freedom each and every
[SPEAKER_00]: individual in the state of Kentucky and
get the police out of the business of
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting morality and put them back in
the business of promoting law and order in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
