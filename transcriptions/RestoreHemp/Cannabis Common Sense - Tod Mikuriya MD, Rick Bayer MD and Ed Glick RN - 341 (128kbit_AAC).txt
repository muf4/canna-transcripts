[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to now run a film clip from
Oregon Normal's Medical Cannabis Award
[SPEAKER_01]: panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this one has some physicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll discuss it when we come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy the clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The psychiatry that I used to know does
not exist anymore, which is talk therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all pill pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to that end, we really don't know what
is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this extends not just to
psychotropics, but I'm going to read you a
[SPEAKER_00]: short letter to John A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kitzhaber, MD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Director, Center for Evidence-Based
Policy, Oregon Health and Science
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is who I suggest, if you want to
contact to embarrass a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On February 25th, I have the view of panel
presentation by your organization on
[SPEAKER_00]: C-SPAN on the cost benefit study of
different pharmaceuticals contracted by
[SPEAKER_00]: AARP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sum total of that panel was they could
not develop any cost benefits analyses,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in analyzing the pharmaceutical
literature, they discovered it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: promotional rather than objective and
scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything masquerading as science is
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based upon California clinical
experience with a range of chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, our findings indicated
significant advantage over other
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals conventionally utilized
because of improved quality of life and
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consequently, we request the opportunity
to discuss our findings with you attached
[SPEAKER_00]: as a list of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what the response was?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad this is going over cable TV in
the Portland area, and hopefully somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: out there in the viewing audience can give
the center a call and ask them to include
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in their studies, and especially
about the mental health issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be fascinated to hear the
response, but I won't hold my breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: So may I interject just very briefly that
obviously there's so much reduction in
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical use that it's an enormous
opening for research, which unfortunately
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians who are taking care of patients
in a primary care setting, they don't seem
[SPEAKER_02]: to be monitoring the change in
prescription drug patterns of their
[SPEAKER_02]: patients before and after they become
members of the OAS.
[SPEAKER_02]: OMP and it's remarkable because these
patients are reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically reducing opiates
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually there's research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you guys are all aware of about
the synergistic effects of the receptor
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of opiates and cannabinoids where
they basically are hitchhiking with each
[SPEAKER_02]: other and small much smaller doses of both
medications create the same benefit with
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, much less side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are really remarkable findings and I
really regret that there aren't physicians
[SPEAKER_02]: who are just monitoring the reduction in
the prescription patterns of their
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they doubt that cannabis is useful,
I would encourage them to please do so and
[SPEAKER_02]: just I mean a before and after evaluation
of their prescriptions will show how much
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction or how much change there is,
but it's really a lost opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you just said, you think
that's new?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read marijuana medical papers in
the Ohio State Medical Society meeting on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in 1860, a Dr. Frombiller from
Ohio reported that using an alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: alternating courses of opiates and
cannabis for treating chronic conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced dependence on opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1859 this was written.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, this is something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about the takeover by
Big Farm and ruining policy through their
[SPEAKER_00]: special interest money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, the fact that this whole
system, this, can I use my favorite
phrase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Monomolecular mercantile madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all patent office driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look back to what it was before the
single molecule ascended to its role in
[SPEAKER_00]: current commercial medicine, you'll see
that it's all secondary to what can get
[SPEAKER_00]: patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they claim that the newly
patented material is increasingly better,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah, but then you see what's
happened to the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten thoroughly corrupted and
perverted so that you don't know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have now a drug seeking,
drug hungering public convinced that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need all sorts of combinations of
patentable materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really sickening our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they started directly advertising
to the public for psychotropics,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, ask your doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social anxiety disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these kinds of influences to influence
you and their bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that was Dr. Todd Micaria,
who wrote medical marijuana papers back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And directly to his left, that was an RN
by the name of Ed Glick.
[SPEAKER_01]: To his right was Dr. Rick Baer,
the chief petitioner on Oregon's ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: measure 67, the medical marijuana law that
passed in 1998.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other fellow off to the side
there that wasn't talking much in that
[SPEAKER_01]: clip was Dr. Cohen from Oregon,
another physician who helps medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Don?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm great, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to see you, Don.
[SPEAKER_01]: DuPay here is currently a social worker,
but he's also a retired Portland police
[SPEAKER_01]: detective.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, what is it, a 17?
