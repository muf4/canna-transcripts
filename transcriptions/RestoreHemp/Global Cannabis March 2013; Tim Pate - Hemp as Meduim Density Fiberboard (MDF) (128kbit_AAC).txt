[SPEAKER_00]: I met a group of people out in Harrisburg,
Oregon, who decided that they would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to import hemp, excuse me, from Spain
through France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did and we had to get the DEA's
permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we imported this hemp and then we took
that hemp and we made boards out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a nice guitar and this is a
really old piece of wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wood is older than the guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on is I've got this piece
of wood that's 20 years old and it has an
[SPEAKER_00]: age today, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was made out of hemp fibers that we
imported from Spain through France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to prove through this
piece of wood right here, or actually
[SPEAKER_00]: medium density fiberboard, that we could
actually create medium density fiberboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that because of that, we have the
ability to change the dynamic in the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we proved this 20 years ago,
but because we didn't do not have,
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere in the world, we do not have
enough adequate supply to actually do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nobody's growing hemp fields in
the United States unless you run out in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska and get some of the ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we just don't have a real
supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ever had a supply, I mean tomorrow,
we could be producing boards out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be turning all the herd in the
inside of the stock into viscose and
[SPEAKER_00]: making, you know, chairs for astronauts
that will never break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we could do things that you
couldn't, you can even imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we actually can't because we got a big
imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons that I keep fighting
and I've been doing this for over 30 years
[SPEAKER_00]: is I believe, I believe, I believe.
I believe we can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it.
