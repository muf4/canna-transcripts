[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, how you feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming at you from southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a long, long drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I heard the ducks won.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a green day.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see your brother, man,
don't put me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, you know that little thought will
stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on to me until we walk at the steps
of Zion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see your brother, I'll be
marching like a lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive vibration's got to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the rising of the moon, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive vibration's got to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it low, yo, PDX.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mikey Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see your sister, don't put
her down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you know, Jalica, children will be
running around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on to her until she walks the steps
of Zion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll see your sister shining with
her light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive vibration's got to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all are in tune to the state of
Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive vibrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It now makes me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time.
