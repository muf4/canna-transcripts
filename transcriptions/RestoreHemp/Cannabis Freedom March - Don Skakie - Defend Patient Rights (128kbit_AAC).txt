[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to hear Doug and the attorneys
are fighting it for us in the courts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know that you have hope in
the referendum system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have referendum 76 against 50-52.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done is removed the most
damaging parts that cut patients access,
[SPEAKER_00]: that shut down authorization clinics,
that shut down access points, and
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate all our testing from labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need only 123,000 signatures to put
this on the ballot for a vote of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people ask us why we didn't do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to remember it's just not just
us voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mainstream voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did as little as we felt was
necessary to achieve the goals of Savvy
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out r76no.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to volunteer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to donate your time,
your talent, or your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we only have 76 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 76 days to get 123,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you, when this
initiative came out, sponsored by Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: William Kurtz, who fought for you by going
to appeal, going to the Supreme Court,
[SPEAKER_00]: and being remanded back to Thurston
County, and they quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill was a convicted felon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill lost his right to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill was paying money out of his pocket
that he needed to put food on his table
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Doug Hyatt stood up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Susan Elliott stood up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the courts agreed, and they sent it
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Thurston County was too embarrassed to
fight on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill returned his right to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he signed to register to vote and then
filed 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a lot of people and a
lot of patience to get signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cannot depend on our people alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need professionals out there to make up
the difference between what we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves and what they're able to do as
professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need money, but we're getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down for $1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I make $12 an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was down in Portland last weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stanford is putting down $1,000 on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear today that Paul is going to
write a letter, put a referendum sheet in
[SPEAKER_00]: an envelope, and mail it to every THCF
clinic patient in Washington state to
[SPEAKER_00]: support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all you can do is sign it, sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all you can do is take a sheet to your
friends and family and bring them back,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a grower, if you're a
medical grower making your living,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting your bread on the table,
grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an access point serving patients
and want to be there next July,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're an authorization clinic and you
go on the road and take care of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have primary care physicians,
that don't have access to these people,
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have the resources,
then we've got to save us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep us open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once that's done, I've got to tell you
that the money interest came out as hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see it in 50-52.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to stop fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to come together and do what the
legislature has failed to do since 1998,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's to codify our best practices as
they exist now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have patients that come into our places
because they are clean, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: respectable, because they're honorable and
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want patients to be forced under
50-52 to go and get their medicine at a
[SPEAKER_00]: 502 store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides are not good medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must keep medical cannabis safe and
separate, separate from recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want patients to go into the store
when they finally have a few dollars and
[SPEAKER_00]: only be able to buy a little bit instead
of what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want any patient to go into
any store and not get their medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: because somebody else got there before
them and bought it just to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happens, you cannot obtain your
medicine at any price, and this is why we
[SPEAKER_00]: must keep medical separate from
recreational demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please check out the referendum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Northwest Cannabis Market is having a
patients rally on the 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be hot dogs, there'll be
some speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get petitions in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own an access point, if you're a
grower, if you've got an authorization
[SPEAKER_00]: clinic, get us your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can volunteer your information on the
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will mail you petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to ask you to print your
own or run to the printer or become any of
the other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to ask you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is send us your
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll send you the envelope, put it out in
front of your people, get it out in your
[SPEAKER_00]: community, and we will get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This must happen by July 23rd to vote in
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we go into the next legislative
session with legislation in hand that
[SPEAKER_00]: saves us, it'll be because we wanted the
polls in November that's the people,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just our people, but everybody in
Washington is going to have a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: say the legislature did a great job,
let's make that the law, or no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we must keep medical separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that they will agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
