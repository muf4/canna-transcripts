[SPEAKER_01]: We still need a long way to go before
cannabis is treated like the relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: benign and harmless herb that we know it
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: How will we get there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How will we get to that point,
that place where we can live freely and
[SPEAKER_01]: peace without, with our plant that has so
much to offer to our community?
[SPEAKER_01]: How will we get to cannabis freedom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we will not get there via circular
firing squads where we in-fight and attack
[SPEAKER_01]: each other, ignoring that the root cause
of our misery is prohibition, not each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not get there by finger pointing
or insults or dividing ourselves at every
[SPEAKER_01]: chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not get there by depending on our
state legislators to protect us and
[SPEAKER_01]: protect our patients and empower our
community to serve its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not get there by expecting the
federal government to protect us from the
[SPEAKER_01]: insanity and the injustice and the
persecution of federal prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know that prohibition every
single time treats us like criminals and
[SPEAKER_01]: creates criminals where they don't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not get there by smashing windows
and turning under cars and lighting trash
[SPEAKER_01]: cans on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, our path has always been, the cannabis
reform movement's path has always been and
[SPEAKER_01]: always will be the high road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, we are stronger than prohibition
and what we're showing is that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger than the United States
government, we're stronger than,
[SPEAKER_01]: than the strongest government in the
history of the world because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: changing it and it's freedom and justice
and liberty that's making it possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, we've been stereotyped,
we've been scapegoated, we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: targeted, incarcerated, stolen from,
denied basic human activities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and locked in by our society with some of
the world's most dangerous criminals and
[SPEAKER_01]: most dysfunctional citizens in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not daunted, we're a
steamroller, we're victories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a tsunami of conviction and
determination, we're in this for the long
[SPEAKER_01]: haul, this movement was built to last.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will, we will get to our victories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get there by understanding the
value of each other, by uplifting everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: around us, by embracing the values and
principles of unity and cooperation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get there by being a united
community despite our differences,
[SPEAKER_01]: by tailing the common ground that joins us
in our struggle for liberty and our
[SPEAKER_01]: endless quest to simply be left alone when
we're not harming anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get there by putting our focus not
on personalities but on issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: not by demonizing people but exposing
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get there by changing bad
policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get there because everything is
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting there, we're waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be experiencing a few steps
forward and one step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be disappointed by the setbacks
and the speed bumps on the path to
[SPEAKER_01]: victory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are changing the world right now before
everybody's eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back when we started,
when we started, you know, we did the
[SPEAKER_01]: first march here in 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the way back in 91 we started the
Hempfest and of course this movement's
[SPEAKER_01]: been going on much longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many people laughed at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They laughed!
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, you'll never get there,
you're wasting your time, you're pissing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fromish will always be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not laughing at us anymore!
[SPEAKER_01]: The same people who said we'd never do it
are now rushing to capitalize and make
[SPEAKER_01]: some money off of this new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we worked so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We marched for workers' rights and we got
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We marched for the vote for women and we
got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We marched for civil rights legislation
that had happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We marched for gay rights and they're
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We marched to get to Vietnam and it ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because history is often made in the
streets of America.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Frederick Douglass noted in a run-up to
the Civil War, power conceives nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: without a demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We demand our freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: We demand equality!
[SPEAKER_01]: What we need to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Resist, oppose, and educate!
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we'll never be stopped until
victory!
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
