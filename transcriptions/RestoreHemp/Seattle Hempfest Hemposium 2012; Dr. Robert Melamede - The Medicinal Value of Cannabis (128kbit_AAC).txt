[SPEAKER_01]: The White House put out a statement that
there's no medical value for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet, we know from the studies and from
the work of patients at a time,
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that you've unearthed and do,
that that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know from Elvia Masaiki who's getting
her medication from the government that
[SPEAKER_01]: they realize that there is some truth to
what we say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we take a bright mind like Obama
and the White House administration and
[SPEAKER_01]: make them realize publicly, publicly,
that there is a medical value to this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What they always resort back to is the
lack of peer-reviewed studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are literally, I've got about
10,000 peer-reviewed studies on my
[SPEAKER_00]: computer dealing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, they're not dealing
with smoke marijuana other than early
[SPEAKER_00]: studies from the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a few and more coming out
now dealing with smoke or with extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one just came out last week from
Germany, basically challenging the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what the federal government is
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is documented medical value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only thing that really makes
politicians listen is when their
[SPEAKER_00]: constituency contacts them directly,
phone, email, more importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes postcards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they start to see or visiting
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they start to listen to when
they realize that their positions are in
[SPEAKER_00]: jeopardy if they don't follow the correct
direction, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's starting to happen
more and more because having spent too
[SPEAKER_00]: much time this summer in Washington,
DC, I now understand much more of how the
[SPEAKER_00]: game is played.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can all learn how to play the
game better, then we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: magnified impact on changing things
quicker and easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's up to the voice of the
people to make it happen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
