[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp.net is an internet service provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has done all of the web design for
Seattle HempFest website.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people have seen our website?
[SPEAKER_00]: www.seattlehempfest.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I introduce you to my good friend and
colleague, Robert Lunde, owner and
[SPEAKER_00]: operator of HempNet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here in the middle of Westlake
Center, you guys look awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who attended some of the
marches against prohibition last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you can appreciate the numbers we
see here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prepare a little something to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we've been marching and speaking out
against the numerous injustices brought on
[SPEAKER_01]: the American people by the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may be a diverse group of people with
differing opinions on the issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one thing is common amongst us all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The war on drugs has affected the lives of
every one of us enough so that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to get in the streets and march
and say that things have got to change and
[SPEAKER_01]: the drug war is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the drug war is wrong because it's
fraught with injustice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forfeiture laws are unjust because they
allow a home or car to be taken without an
[SPEAKER_01]: individual to be charged with a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandatory minimums are unjust because
there's no room to consider the
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances that go along with the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judge should have that option.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legislature should not be saying you
go to jail for 10 years because you are
[SPEAKER_01]: related or heard about a drug bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis prohibition is unjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our laws are hypocrisy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hypocrisy that we can drink alcohol
which kills hundreds of people every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hypocrisy that you can legally smoke
nicotine and yet it kills hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of people every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet I'll stand here and say you have
the right to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should as a free American be able to
consume nicotine, to drink alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the result of this unjust war?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for example, there's a Mr. Gray who
was a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marine for five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went off and served this country in the
Gulf War.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came back with numerous unexplainable
illnesses, uncontrollable vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to the VA hospital 20 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They prescribed numerous legal drugs,
none of them which could help him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally he turned, like many sufferers
of the Gulf War syndrome do, to marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: and he found relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we thank him?
[SPEAKER_01]: We steal his fucking house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another injustice is the East Side
Narcotics Task Force.
[SPEAKER_01]: We allow them to engage in terrorist
tactics, destroying homes, and
[SPEAKER_01]: traumatizing children house after house
after house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unjust that Will Foster, who grows
marijuana for his own personal medical
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, should be sentenced to 93 years in
jail in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drug war needs to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eighty percent of our forfeitures occur
where no individual was charged with a
[SPEAKER_01]: crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is such an injustice and we
don't have to look farther than our own
[SPEAKER_01]: law of Washington to see the problems with
this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to read the three pillars of
the Washington State Forfeiture Law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tenet number one, and this is in the HIPP
Voters Guide if you saw this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, in cases involving personal
property, the burden of producing evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: shall be upon the person claiming to be
the lawful owner of the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they plan something, it's up to you to
prove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your friend has a joint in your car and
they take your car, it's your
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility to prove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no due process in that and
there's no justice in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why does it happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at the next two pillars of the
Washington State Forfeiture Law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two is each seizing agency shall
remit to the state treasurer and about
[SPEAKER_01]: equal to ten percent of the net proceeds
of any of the property forfeited.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the final pillar, what happens to the
other ninety percent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Forfeited property and the net proceeds
not required to be paid to the state
[SPEAKER_01]: treasurer shall be retained by the seizing
law enforcement agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an invitation for corruptness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer a balanced justice system
that we're supposed to have in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forfeiture laws and the drug war needs
to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're stealing it!
[SPEAKER_02]: We're stealing it!
We're stealing it!
We're stealing it!
We're stealing it!
We're stealing it!
