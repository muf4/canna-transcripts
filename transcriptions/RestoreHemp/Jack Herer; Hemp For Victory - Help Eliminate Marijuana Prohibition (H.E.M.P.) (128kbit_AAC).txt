[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Jack Herr from an
organization called HEMP, which is Help
[SPEAKER_00]: Eliminate or End Marijuana Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show you a movie called
HEMP for Victory that was made by the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States Department of Agriculture in
1942 for encouraging the war effort to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow 350,000 acres of cannabis,
of hemp, of marijuana, cannabis sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: each year for the next three years for the
war.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than they had grown in the preceding
50 years in the United States combined,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly importing their hemp from the Far
East and Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this movie is on, you may not
realize that hemp was the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: product in America and in the world for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All commerce was carried by hemp and
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, the word canvas, as you'll see in
the movie, comes from the Arabic word and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dutch word for hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canvas is the Dutch pronunciation of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movie you're about to see,
for the last 20 years, the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: government says that no such movie was
ever made by any department of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States government.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we know that from at least 1981 on,
that reporters for magazines, newspapers
[SPEAKER_00]: have been told, and you'll see actual
letters denying that this movie was ever
[SPEAKER_00]: made by any department of the United
States Department of Agriculture or by any
[SPEAKER_00]: department of the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl Packard, Maria Farrow, myself,
Jack Herrera, after going all through the
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture library at
Beltsville, Maryland in April and May of
[SPEAKER_00]: 1989, went to the Library of Congress
Motion Pictures and Film Strips to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: we could find any documentation that this
movie that the newspapers were telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: that they couldn't run as being affirmed
by the government, that the government
[SPEAKER_00]: said that they'd never made this movie
that I was showing to television
[SPEAKER_00]: reporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were other people, activists all
over the country, who were showing this
[SPEAKER_00]: movie and were being told that this movie
was never made by the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl, Marie, and I went into the Library
of Congress through the Motion Pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: and Film Strips and we did a search with
their librarians as we had done at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture library in
Beltsville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found no trace of this movie in
their electronic searches, in their
[SPEAKER_00]: catalogs, or in any of their card files.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were convinced that even though we
believed the movie was totally genuine,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was no record and that these
people weren't deliberately lying,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just didn't have, somehow,
somewhere it had been omitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, as we were about to leave the
building after leaving the room where the
[SPEAKER_00]: film strips and motion pictures were
housed, we thought, well, let's go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and give it another try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked Mrs. Catherine Longby,
I believe her name is, the librarian to
[SPEAKER_00]: assist us again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, what if we had come here 30 or
40?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really know what we were going
to say when we got back into that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, what if we had come here 30 or 40
years ago, and in the 1940s or 50s,
[SPEAKER_00]: and asked for the movie Hemp for Victory?
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't have gone to the electronic
searches or the current catalogs or any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other things that you use today,
the card catalogs to file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would those catalogs be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you throw them away?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she says, no, they're over by the
copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep all the old catalogs, and you can
go over there and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they would have been here,
they would have showed up on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it would have been in any of those
books, it would have shown up already
[SPEAKER_00]: today in our searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'd like to show you a typical letter
that was sent out denying that this movie
[SPEAKER_00]: was made by the United States Department
of Ag Culture or any other division of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Mr. Jim Evans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dear Mr. Evans, now this is from the
United States Department of Ag Culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Oregon State Office, from John
Valcalcar, the information officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dear Mr. Evans, we contacted the
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: office of the Department of Ag Culture and
also the federal audio center,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have been unable to locate any film
with the title Hemp for Victory that was
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by any department of the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're reading the certification by
the photo duplication service from the
[SPEAKER_00]: chief of photo duplication service of the
Library of Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said that there is now in the
collections of the Library of Congress a
[SPEAKER_00]: publication entitled, The National Union
Catalog, volume 28, Motion Pictures and
[SPEAKER_00]: Film Strips, 1953 through 1957.
[SPEAKER_00]: I further certify that the attached
photocopies are true copies of title page
[SPEAKER_00]: and page 367.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in testimony whereof, I hereunto
subscribe my name and cause my seal of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Library of Congress to be affixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you can see, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next you see the front page of the
National Union Catalog, the title page,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1953 to 57, volume 28, where we discovered
Hemp for Victory, Motion Picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Ag Culture, 1942,
14 minutes, black and white, 16
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then summary explains that the war cut
off the supply of East Indian coarse
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers and stresses the need for American
grown hemp for military and civilian uses,
[SPEAKER_00]: portrays farm practices of hemp growers in
Kentucky and Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this went out to, supposedly,
into the archives under Hemp, U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: also the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Ag Culture, they give you
their number there, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Office of Education, and the Visual
Education Service, all of which this
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next we have the certification from the
same chief of photo duplication service of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Library of Congress that there's now
in the collections of Library of Congress,
[SPEAKER_00]: publication entitled Educational Film
Guide, Annual Edition, 1945.
[SPEAKER_00]: I further certified that the attached
photocopies are two copies of the title
[SPEAKER_00]: page, the reverse title page, and page
331.
[SPEAKER_00]: In testimony whereof, I hereunto subscribe
my name and cause the seal of the Library
[SPEAKER_00]: of Congress to be affixed, this 12th of
July, 1989.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, as you can see, on page 331,
under 677.7, Hemp Twine and Knots is Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: for Victory, 14 minute, 16 millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says here, a USDA production shows
how the war cut off our supply of East
[SPEAKER_00]: Indian coarse fibers and the urgent need
for American grown hemp for our Army and
[SPEAKER_00]: Navy as well as civilian use, portrays
farm practices of hemp growers in Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: and Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof now is that this movie does
really exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government for years have been telling
all of our media that this movie didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: exist, and all of our activists were being
impugned on their integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think, let the movie speak for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please watch all 14 minutes of this film,
because every bit of it is memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right up to when you see the parachute
webbing that George Bush jumped down over
[SPEAKER_00]: the Pacific with was made out of marijuana
that saved the poor boy's life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long ago, when these ancient Grecian
temples were new, hemp was already old in
[SPEAKER_04]: the service of mankind.
[SPEAKER_04]: For thousands of years, even then,
this plant had been grown for cordage and
[SPEAKER_04]: coarse cloth in China and elsewhere in the
East.
[SPEAKER_04]: For centuries prior to about 1850,
all the ships that sailed the western seas
[SPEAKER_04]: were rigged with hemp and rope and sails.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the sailor no less than the hangman,
hemp was indispensable.
[SPEAKER_04]: A 44-gun frigate, like our cherished old
iron sides, took over 60 tons of hemp for
[SPEAKER_04]: rigging, including an anchor cable 25
inches in circumference.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Conestoga wagons and prayerist
schooners of pioneer days were covered
[SPEAKER_04]: with hemp and canvas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, the very word canvas comes from
the Arabic word for hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: In those days, hemp was an important crop
in Kentucky and Missouri.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then came cheaper imported fibers for
cordage, like jute, sisal, and manila
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp, and the culture of hemp in America
declined.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, with Philippine and East Indian
sources of hemp in the hands of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Japanese and shipment of jute from India
curtailed, American hemp must meet the
[SPEAKER_04]: needs of our Army and Navy as well as of
our industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 1942, patriotic farmers, at the
government's request, planted 36,000 acres
[SPEAKER_04]: of seed hemp, an increase of several
thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal for 1943 is 50,000 acres of seed
hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Kentucky, much of the seed hemp acreage
is on river bottom land such as this,
[SPEAKER_04]: along the Kentucky River Gorge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these fields are inaccessible
except by boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thus, plans are afoot for a great
expansion of the hemp industry as a part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the war program.
[SPEAKER_04]: This film is designed to tell farmers how
to handle this ancient crop, now little
[SPEAKER_04]: known outside Kentucky and Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful how you use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For to grow hemp legally, you must have a
federal registration and tax stamp.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is provided for in your contract.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask your AAA committee man or your county
agent about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget, hemp demands a rich,
well-grained soil such as is found here in
[SPEAKER_04]: the bluegrass region of Kentucky or in
central Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be loose and rich in organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor soils won't do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil that will grow good corn will usually
grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp is not hard on the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Kentucky, it has been grown for several
years on the same ground, though this
[SPEAKER_04]: practice is not recommended.
[SPEAKER_04]: A dense and shady crop, hemp tends to
choke out weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a Canada thistle that couldn't
stand the competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead as a dodo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thus, hemp leaves the ground in good
condition for the following crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: For fiber, hemp should be sown five pecks
to the acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: With drill, the closer the rows,
the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: These rows are spaced about four inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: This hemp has been broadcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, it should be sown thick enough
to grow a slender stalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an ideal stand, the right height to
be harvested easily, thick enough to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: slender stalks that are easy to cut and
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stalks like these here on the left,
they yield the most fiber and the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those on the right are too coarse and
woody.
[SPEAKER_04]: For seed, hemp is planted in hills like
corn, sometimes by hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp is a dioecious plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The female flower is inconspicuous,
but the male flower is easily spotted.
[SPEAKER_04]: In seed production, after the pollen has
been shed, these male plants are cut out.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the seeds on a female plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp for fiber is ready to harvest when
the pollen is shedding and the leaves are
[SPEAKER_04]: falling.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Kentucky, hemp harvest comes in August.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, the old standby has been the
self-rake reaper, which has been used for
[SPEAKER_04]: a generation or more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp grows so luxuriantly in Kentucky that
harvesting is sometimes difficult,
[SPEAKER_04]: which may account for the popularity of
the self-rake with its lateral stroke.
[SPEAKER_04]: A modified rice binder has been used to
some extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: This machine works well in average hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, the improved hemp harvester,
used for many years in Wisconsin,
[SPEAKER_04]: has been introduced in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: This machine spreads the hemp in a
continuous swath.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a far cry from this fast and
efficient modern harvester to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Armstrong model of yore.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's one kind of harvester,
at least, that doesn't stall in the
[SPEAKER_04]: heaviest hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Kentucky, hand cutting is practiced in
opening fields for the machines.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Kentucky, hemp is shocked as soon as
safe after cutting to be spread out for
[SPEAKER_04]: retting later in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Wisconsin, hemp is harvested in
September.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, the hemp harvester with automatic
spreader is standard equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Note how smoothly the rotating apron lays
the swath preparatory to retting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, it is a common and essential
practice to leave headlands around hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: These strips may be planted to other
crops, preferably small grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thus, the harvester has room to make its
first round without preparatory hand
[SPEAKER_04]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, the machine is running over corn
stubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the cutter bar is much shorter than
the hemp is tall, overlapping occurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so good for retting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The standard cut is 8 to 9 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The length of time hemp is left on the
ground to ret depends on the weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: The swath must be turned to get a uniform
ret.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the woody core breaks away readily,
like this, the hemp is about ready to take
[SPEAKER_04]: up and bind into bundles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well-retted hemp is light to dark gray.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fiber tends to pull away from the
stalk.
[SPEAKER_04]: The presence of stalks in the bowstring
stage indicates that retting is well
[SPEAKER_04]: underway.
[SPEAKER_04]: When hemp is short or tangled,
or when the ground is too wet for
[SPEAKER_04]: machines, it is bound by hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: A wooden buck is used.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twine will do for tying, but the hemp
itself makes a good band.
[SPEAKER_04]: When conditions are favorable,
the pickup bander is commonly used.
[SPEAKER_04]: The swath should lie smooth and even with
stalks parallel.
[SPEAKER_04]: The picker won't work well in tangled
hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: After binding, hemp is shocked as soon as
possible to stop further retting.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 1942, 14,000 acres of fiber hemp were
harvested in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal for 1943 is 300,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thus, hemp, cannabis, sativa, the old
standby cordage fiber, is staging a strong
[SPEAKER_04]: comeback.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Kentucky hemp going into the dryer
of a mill at Versailles.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the old days, breaking was done by
hand, one of the hardest jobs known to
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the power breaker makes quick work of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spinning American hemp into rope,
yarn, or twine in the old Kentucky River
[SPEAKER_04]: mill at Frankfort, Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another pioneer plant that has been making
cordage for more than a century.
[SPEAKER_04]: All such plants will presently be turning
out products spun from American grown
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twine of various kinds for tying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Winding armatures and a poster's work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rope for marine rigging and towing,
for hay forks, derricks, and heavy duty
[SPEAKER_04]: tackle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Light beauty fire hose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thread for shoes for millions of American
soldiers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And parachute webbing for our
paratroopers.
[SPEAKER_04]: As for the United States Navy,
every battleship requires 34,000 feet of
[SPEAKER_04]: rope and other craft accordingly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here in the Boston Navy yard where
cables for frigates were made long ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: crews are now working night and day making
cordage for the fleet.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the old days, rope yarn was spun by
hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, even the rope walk is mechanized.
[SPEAKER_04]: 160 fathoms to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rope yarn feeds through holes in an
iron plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is manila hemp from the Navy's
rapidly dwindling reserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: When that is gone, American hemp will go
on duty again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp for mooring ships.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp for tow lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp for tackle and gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp for countless naval uses,
both on ship and shore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as in the days when old Ironside
sailed the seas victorious with her hempen
[SPEAKER_04]: shrouds and hempen sails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp for victory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I received a letter of vital importance
from a member of the narcotics bureau.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read this letter to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dear Dr. Carroll, the suppression of
the use of marijuana and of the forces
[SPEAKER_03]: lurking behind it are the most important
jobs this department is now engaged in.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the outset of this letter, there is one
vital fact I would like to submit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a powerful agency.
[SPEAKER_03]: I speak of the school parent associations
of this country, which can be invaluable
[SPEAKER_03]: in stamping out this scourge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their help, their eternal vigilance,
could be the deciding factor in our fight
[SPEAKER_03]: against it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weed marijuana is grown in every state
in the union.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, in the city of Brooklyn,
New York, a field of marijuana was found
[SPEAKER_03]: behind a tenement court.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weed was here being cultivated,
regularly stripped and dried and sold in
[SPEAKER_03]: schools and at government army posts in
and around New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dried leaves and berries are ground up
and made into cigarettes by a simple hand
[SPEAKER_03]: machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The deadly narcotic is thus quickly and
easily prepared for its market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sale of marijuana is even more
difficult to detect and halt than the
[SPEAKER_03]: trafficking drugs such as opium,
morphine, and heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are hidden in fake jewelry cases,
in the heels of shoes, women's shoes
[SPEAKER_03]: especially, because the drugs can be
secreted in false heels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hollowed shavages are another medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Books with false centers are often used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch cases are convenient hiding places.
[SPEAKER_03]: The value of drugs thus seized is
enormous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, a huge supply of heroin was
taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was concealed in an apparently harmless
shipment of 35 barrels of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The deadly drug was burned in the
incinerator of the Bureau of Engraving and
[SPEAKER_03]: Printing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And more vicious, more deadly,
even than these soul-destroying drugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the menace of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt, many of you do not believe that
these things do happen, but they cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may also believe that the facts have
been exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you what's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Library of Congress themselves has
accepted these movies, or has recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptance, as you can see in the letter,
from the assistant chief of the MBRS
[SPEAKER_00]: Division, gift of videocassettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Paul C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spear, S-P-E-H-R.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, two half-inch videocassettes
were brought to the MBRS Division on
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday, May 19, 1989, their bearer,
Jack Herrera, Hemp Pac, California
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Initiative, Fan Eyes,
California, of the Help Eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Prohibition, Hemp Pac Political
Action Committee, wishes to donate the
[SPEAKER_00]: tapes to the Library's collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spoke with Mrs. Catherine Longney.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tapes are duplicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each contains the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp for Victory, produced in 1942 by the
United States Department of Agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Reefer Madness, Excerpts, produced in
1936, originally 67 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this material is excerpts only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that we accept them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from Paul C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spear, assistant chief of the MBRS
Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief of that gift division of the motion
pictures and film strips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'd like to ask you to send $20 to the
Help Eliminate Marijuana Prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp Pac, 5632 Van Eyes Boulevard,
Van Eyes, California, Suite 210,
[SPEAKER_00]: Zip 91401, Van Eyes, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our phone number is 818-377-5886.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd like you to know that we'll send
you a copy of Hemp for Victory with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the documentation you just saw,
as well as a copy of the book,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please use this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send away for more of this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like one of our t-shirts,
they're $12.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the Hemp for Victory t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have new t-shirts coming out all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want you to do is support normal,
support Hemp, and get this information
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really a grassroots organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have one big message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that your government,
for whatever its reasons, lied about the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one product probably on earth for
paper, fiber, fuel, and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it did it at a conscious level or
an unconscious level, they've been sending
[SPEAKER_00]: people hundreds and hundreds of thousands
to prison and taking away their
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, their children, their cars,
for marijuana that, in any sane society,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would reward people for using in
comparison to alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: The national drug control strategy
proposed by President Bush and drug czar
[SPEAKER_00]: Bennett isn't worth the environmentally
disastrous and unnecessary sulfuric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: and dioxin-laced wood pulp process paper,
which it is printed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, the continued prohibition of
hemp marijuana cultivation prevents our
[SPEAKER_00]: society from utilizing nature's premier
renewable resource for the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: earth's paper, fiber, fuel, food,
paint, and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, at the time of George
Washington, he and all American farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: were required to grow and could even pay
their taxes with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hemp was used for the majority of
colonial Americas in the world's paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing, towels, diapers, lace,
sails, canvas, Dutch pronunciation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, rope paint, varnish,
lighting oil, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, as recently as World War II with
Philippine and Asian hemp cut off by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture in 1942 produced
a 14-minute black and white film,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp for Victory, encouraging and
instructing patriotic American farmers to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow 350,000 acres of hemp per year by
1943 to be used for civilian and military
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes, rope, fire hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the parachute webbing that George
Bush held onto when he bailed out over the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific was made from cannabis hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp uses the sun more efficiently than
virtually any other plant on our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, on a planet-wide, climate-wide,
and soil-wide basis, hemp, grown annually,
[SPEAKER_00]: would produce approximately 40 times the
biomass that is living organic matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: the next best annual rival biomass crops
that can be grown on earth, such as corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: cunuff, and sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have the ability and the
mechanized technology to use hemp biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: and other biofuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ability to use hemp biomass
for energy farming and produce all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, renewable fuel we would need for
all of our cars, homes, and industry with
[SPEAKER_00]: a net reduction of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretical computer models have shown
that reversing the greenhouse effect will
[SPEAKER_00]: only be possible if possible at all,
if hemp and other biomass wastes are used
[SPEAKER_00]: again, as they were until 130 years ago,
for making the overall majority of earth's
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, fiber, fuels, paints, and now
everything from plastics to dynamite.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for marijuana, the blossom of the hemp
plant, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: government clinical studies as well as
studies of the Jamaican, Costa Rican,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Greek marijuana using populations
indicate statistically that you will live
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a year longer if you smoke
marijuana every day than if you use no
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs at all, and eight to 24 years longer
than regular tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1987, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: government statistics reported 395,000
Americans died from tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: 87% of all lung cancer cases were caused
by tobacco use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the National Institute of Drug
Abuse, that's NIDA, reports 125,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans died in 1987 from alcohol use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same agency and the Surgeon General's
mortality statistics report zero ZERO
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths ever due to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of October 1988, no case of lung
cancer has ever been attributed solely to
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we at hemp are seeking a
Marijuana Hemp Armistice, that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate nationwide moratorium on the
personal medical and industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression of hemp, and for the President
and Congress to immediately appoint a Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Advisory Commission to oversee and
expedite reintroduction of hemp to
[SPEAKER_00]: American agriculture, business,
and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our justifications for this moratorium and
commission are that with few exceptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the American public, especially
our politicians who should have known when
[SPEAKER_00]: they made these laws, the judges who
should have known when they enforced them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the police, and even the teachers who
should have taught them and all the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of us in the first place, knew virtually
any of the preceding history, facts,
[SPEAKER_00]: information, or the vast potential of hemp
as Earth's premier natural renewable
[SPEAKER_00]: resource, biomass, and life extender.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have to go to jail for fighting for
that, or give up any other part,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you should, you should be proud to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, such a sweet thing as marijuana to
go to jail for, put there by people that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even know this information,
haven't the foggiest idea, and yet
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals, petrochemicals, fossil fuels
are totally legal in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the greatest things, if not the
greatest natural growing thing on Earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every damn politician out there should be
ashamed of themselves forever if they
[SPEAKER_00]: continue this now that they know this,
and don't check it out if they've heard it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't believe it, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's true, you better change your
ways, because if a world would accept you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to live in that world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the world doesn't accept you,
you should be proud of a world that would
[SPEAKER_00]: teach you how to behave like adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you want kids to behave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to be responsible to control their
uses?
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect you to control the abuses of the
power of legislating stupidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: ignorance, and the end of my planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
