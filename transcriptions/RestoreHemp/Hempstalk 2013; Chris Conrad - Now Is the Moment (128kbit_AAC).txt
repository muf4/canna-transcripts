[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, hemp stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to be here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You enjoying this beautiful day today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm enough for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you better get used to it because
when I wrote my book 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp Lifeline to the Future, I said that
if they didn't legalize hemp soon and make
[SPEAKER_00]: a situation where we changed our
industrial base away from fossil fuels and
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemicals and taking it out of the
hands of the multi-corporations and
[SPEAKER_00]: returning it to the hands of the farmers
and the workers of this society,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can pretty much count on increased
desertification, rising tides,
[SPEAKER_00]: rising temperatures, and climate change in
a way that comes in the term of extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what didn't happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: The government did not step in and do the
right thing, and guess what has happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ocean has risen eight inches since I
wrote that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polar ice caps have melted away to a
large extent, more in the North Pole than
[SPEAKER_00]: the South, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that the multi-corporate
national corporations are running things
[SPEAKER_00]: more than ever, that Monsanto is trying to
dominate the food lines, the seeds that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all need, that this generation has gotten
from our ancestors and forebears who
[SPEAKER_00]: worked so hard to bring us to this point
in history where we stand today at a
[SPEAKER_00]: pivotal epochal moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question today is not will cannabis
survive because hemp has been around for
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been side by side with humans for
10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is will the human race,
is the human race smart enough to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: use hemp to make sure that we survive,
that you survive, that your children
[SPEAKER_00]: survive, that our economy grows in a way
that doesn't require constant increases in
[SPEAKER_00]: consumerism and constant destruction of
our forests and pollution of our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the moment where we stand today
and as I'm here at the stage here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempstock, I'm reminded that the last time
I came and stood on the stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking onto the stage to speak and
a good friend of mine was walking off the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage having just spoken and that guy was
named Jack Herrer and he went off the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and I saw him sit down next to a
tree and I went on the stage to speak and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the last time I saw Jack alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spirit of Jack Herrer is here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in this land like nowhere else
because this is where Jack poured it out
[SPEAKER_00]: and you are the people who remember him
and who remember the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I edited the book The Emperor Wears
No Clothes, it was a moment where I saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: diamond in the rough, a book that I
thought could change the world and now
[SPEAKER_00]: today we're at a moment where John McCain
has come out favorable for legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, where the Tea Party candidates
led the charge to get industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: restored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not saying this because these are
the people that I agree with on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: political things, I'm just saying look how
far we have come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how far the information is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon and California, we have a big
problem on our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State kicked our ass last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They legalized marijuana in a way that we
don't necessarily like all the details but
[SPEAKER_00]: they did it in a way that does allow for
the restoration of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado likewise, the state of Kentucky
decriminalized up to eight ounces of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and has a policy program in
which they have a statewide commission to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate how to bring hemp back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the conservatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the area that's supposed to believe
in saving the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the liberal, the progressive group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they getting ahead of us?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because history has taken a step
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because when Barack Obama said to us
we have to force him to do the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, that we came back and we have done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that the Department of Justice
has announced a new policy to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of people who go to prison on
mandatory minimums is not because the
[SPEAKER_00]: prison industrial complex wants it,
it's because we, the people, have demanded
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that we have these advances
happening and that the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice has announced that it's going to
respect the marijuana laws in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington is not because Barack Obama is
such a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is because the people of the
United States have moved ahead of our
[SPEAKER_00]: government and they're too darn slow at
catching up with us and so that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're here to do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm not trying to steal the thunder
of my next speaker, a good friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stanford, but one of the reasons that
wild horses cannot keep me from being here
[SPEAKER_00]: today is because I believe that the great
state of Oregon will legalize marijuana at
[SPEAKER_00]: the next election in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm more confident than ever because
of what Paul is going to tell you about
[SPEAKER_00]: three initiatives that have just gotten
approved to be circulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's anybody out there who
really thinks that you want a future where
[SPEAKER_00]: your children can grow up in an
environment that is not toxic,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a world that is not controlled by
Monsanto, and international corporations,
[SPEAKER_00]: you better register, you better get your
petition and get out and collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures to put this thing on the ballot
because we can't keep waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go and visit the HEP Hut and learn about
how important HEP is to our ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: to our economy, in fact, to our future and
the future of our children and their
[SPEAKER_00]: children from here out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a child of the baby boomer generation,
I'm embarrassed at the condition which my
[SPEAKER_00]: generation passed the world onto your
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I beg you, do not make the same
mistake we made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not become complacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not become self-indulgent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our human race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're gone, HEP will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's do this right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take that hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bash it into a lifeline of rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can grab onto and pull ourselves
into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Chris Conrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: HEP for victory!
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Conrad, passion dedicated after
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do no less?
[SPEAKER_00]: Show passion, show dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go hard for weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you understand where I'm coming from?
