[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with where I represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I represent South Jackson County,
everything from the Green Springs to
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashton Town, Phoenix, into Jacksonville,
into the Applegate Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the House Democratic co-chair of
the Ways and Means Committee, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: budget committee in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always, I have favored
legalization for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think prohibition has not worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had decades of evidence that says
prohibition does not work and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what really spurs me on now is having
spent the last three or four years on the
[SPEAKER_00]: budget committee, signing my names to
budgets that cut education for our kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: that cut healthcare for seniors,
that make our communities less safe by
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting back public safety programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't in good conscience continue to do
that work of trying to rebalance the state
[SPEAKER_00]: budget through cuts when I know there is a
source of revenue that is reasonable,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is rational, it's the right policy
choice, and it's the right economic choice
[SPEAKER_00]: for our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the legalization of marijuana
and the legalization of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if all of you follow
this, but in 2009, the legislature passed
[SPEAKER_00]: a bill confirming the state of Oregon's
policy is to have legalized industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government still says we
cannot grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've passed legislation on industrial
hemp that as soon as the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government comes to a rational decision on
that and allows the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp, our state will be ready
to move into production of industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that proposal, just so you know,
passed almost unanimously, Republican and
[SPEAKER_00]: Democratic, urban and rural.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the representatives and the
senators from Eastern Oregon were some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most enthusiastic backers of having
industrial hemp as a crop for our state
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes economic sense for jobs and their
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes economic sense for the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will get there on industrial hemp,
and we are going to get there on
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can liken this to the effort through the
initiative system of when women got the
[SPEAKER_00]: right to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon was the first state to put that on
the ballot and have it passed by our
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took three times to get on the ballot,
three times on the ballot to finally pass,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, the law of the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This effort has been building,
and we have people here who have worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: it for many, many years, has been building
for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a point now where making a major
leap forward by having this on the ballot
[SPEAKER_00]: for the voters of Oregon to give their
view on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will render their verdict next
Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll know what it is, and if it passes,
we sincerely hope it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work with it to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep putting pressure on the feds to
make sure that becomes the law for the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Oregon and hopefully influence
the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the ballot in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the ballot in Colorado as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will watch how those elections turn out
as well, and we'll build off what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: here on Tuesday no matter what,
but I just wanted to be here today to,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, express my strong support for
legalization, my strong support for
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp as well, my strong support
for ending prohibition, having rational
[SPEAKER_00]: drug policies in the state of Oregon and
in the United States of America to move in
[SPEAKER_00]: a totally different direction,
and the other, the last issue I'll touch
[SPEAKER_00]: on is one that I think called the press
conference here today to emphasize as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, is expansion of the medical
marijuana program to include
[SPEAKER_00]: post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me is a reasonable and,
again, totally vital step for the state to
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people in the state right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon can and should be a leader in the
research of how marijuana impacts ailments
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the growers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the medical community here,
and we obviously have the people in need
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should put that together, put the
people who are suffering from ailments
[SPEAKER_00]: together, the people doing research on
marijuana, and the growers, and come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the data so we can say with great
confidence that someone who is suffering
[SPEAKER_00]: from PTSD with this strain of marijuana or
that strain of marijuana can expect
[SPEAKER_00]: certain results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone with chronic pain with this strain
of marijuana or that strain of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: used in this way can expect these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical marijuana program,
in my view, needs to be professionalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we need to make sure that it's having
the best possible outcomes for the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who are on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I will just turn it over to
you.
Thank you.
