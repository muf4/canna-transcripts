[SPEAKER_02]: The Israeli scientist, I think his name is
Raphael Nakhon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one who discovered THC about 25
years ago and then discovered the receptor
[SPEAKER_01]: sites, or at least worked on the T-move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worked on those and has also been involved
in some of the endogenous cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: the natural substances we all have in our
brains and bodies as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, are those comparable to
endorphins or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're a different group of
chemicals, also endogenous though,
[SPEAKER_01]: that use different receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different receptors for the
opioids, morphine and codeine,
[SPEAKER_01]: those two substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the endorphins are among these agents
that help energize the neurons to put out
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitters in various centers of the
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabinoids, or the components of the
marijuana leaf, are yet another system,
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacological system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that endogenous system, I think they
call it the endorphin-like substance,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's ananamide, is that the proper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anandamide is the one that is best
developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also uses the so-called CB1 receptor,
cannabinoid 1 receptor, such as THC does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another one that's 2AG,
arachidoneal glycerol, which is another of
[SPEAKER_01]: these endogenous cannabinoid-like
substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they identified the primary action of
this receptor system?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many actions, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: The receptors have been identified and
cloned, actually, and they can be sighted
[SPEAKER_01]: or located in various parts of the brain
that have to do with pain perception,
[SPEAKER_01]: with movement control, with control of
vomiting, with warm and pleasant feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: With sedation, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very common throughout the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that there is a definite, what shall we
say, therapeutic action of these
[SPEAKER_00]: substances, would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: The actions that you mentioned seem to me
to be therapeutic, or could be
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they might be exploited for
therapeutic uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct, because there are these
systems in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reason, I'm sure,
that people have found some utility for
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of these cannabinoid substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the president of the Institute of
Medicine asked you to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: co-investigator, can you tell us about the
process that led up to the Institute of
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicine conducting this inquiry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy, which is directed by
[SPEAKER_01]: Barry McCaffrey, asked the Institute to
consider such a study and was willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: fund it.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the same time, a major foundation
also thought this would be worthy of
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Institute thought it better,
and so did apparently General McCaffrey,
[SPEAKER_01]: if only the one sponsor were responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a proposal was made to his office
by the Institute staff, which led to a
[SPEAKER_01]: statement of task, so-called, and then the
funding of the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the mandate from the Office of
National Drug Control Policy on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they exclude, they just wanted the
medical report, nothing to do with science
[SPEAKER_02]: or social science?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, the science, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted the scientific basis for any
benefits or harms that might come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical use of marijuana or its component
substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were not restricted, but we were
not picked, either, to address issues of
[SPEAKER_01]: social, legislative, regulatory,
et cetera, kinds of considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would have been a very
different statement of task and a very
[SPEAKER_01]: different group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not have included me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you involved at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the Institute of Medicine
produced a report 15 years before
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding marijuana, not specifically as
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must have reviewed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in 1982.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was frustrated by the lack of clear
science, rigorous experimentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and called repeatedly for research in
various fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, there's been an explosion
of knowledge in the basic science field.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these anandamide and receptors and
neurotransmitters and sighting of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things in various control areas in the
brain have been elaborated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were at a distinct advantage over
the people who did that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope we carried things a bit
further because of that new science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you address that explosion in
science and discovery of the receptor
[SPEAKER_02]: system a bit for our audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it really was the identification of
the receptors themselves, cloning them,
[SPEAKER_01]: sighting them wherever they were found,
both in the brain and peripherally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CB2, the cannabinoid 2 receptor,
is primarily in the immune system and more
[SPEAKER_01]: peripheral nervous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CB1 is primarily in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: These endogenous cannabinoid-like
substances that I've mentioned were
[SPEAKER_01]: elaborated and a good deal of just
straight pharmacology done on them so that
[SPEAKER_01]: we had the advantage of, oh, for example,
showing the effects in animals on pain and
[SPEAKER_01]: showing the effects on control of motion,
things of that nature from these basic
[SPEAKER_01]: science advances.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really quite remarkable and
pretty exciting to an internist clinician
[SPEAKER_01]: like myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea they had existed.
