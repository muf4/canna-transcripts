[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons I love the West Coast
is people here ask me if I want marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than if I have marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere else I go, people are like,
man, you got any weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I don't know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all right, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a brownie right now because
I'm talking to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I no longer have to talk to people,
I will eat all of your brownies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll have crazy hashish-laced
dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed, for me, weed is the umami flavor of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed is the soy sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed is the ketchup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed is the ranch dressing of doing shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shit is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put some weed on it, it's a little bit
cooler, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not cool at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dip it in some weed, it's all right,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care to wash dishes, but I don't
mind getting high and washing dishes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually very pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes an extra hour because I have to
make a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for New Jersey Weed Man,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who says people in New Jersey are rude?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought me a joint and a lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's going to smoke it for me,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pass to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a...
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some purplene and some sizzling
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can taste the Listerine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to make your breath great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has great effects on breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all these older people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all getting old, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us have been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed keeps you cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old stoners are way cuter than old drunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's like, oh, cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandpa's hitting the bong again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to, Grandpa's hitting your mom
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a completely different... That's
why I like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can figure out where it's
from with my Kronosaur palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't do Kronosaur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't sit around with your fancy
pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give some tasting notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from New Jersey, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Toledo... Toledo window box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the old George Carlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody from Bellinghams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the old elephant and castle weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Bella Spare Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone swam over the river from Canadia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how you get to Canada
from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody's fancy with the weed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all like, oh, you know, everybody has
tasting notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This delightful train wreck has notes of
limonene and munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just make shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's in charge of naming weed,
by the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need weed named Green Crack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want weed that makes you act like
crack?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naming weed after people is also weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: My boy called me up the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, hey man, I crossed a white
widow with a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it Courtney Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That joke always kills in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But people, there was weed named after
Charlie Sheen for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlie Sheen is not a weed head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlie Sheen is a crack head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you smoke weed that makes you act
like a crack head?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good on the Charlie Sheen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some Willie Nelson in the
back, perhaps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get an eighth of the Miles Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A half ounce of Sanjay Garcia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of grams of Snoop,
because I'm going to a party later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't love these hoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's Obama Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit gets you so high, you stare off
into space like a president.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more minorities in the cannabis
industry, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys work on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we work on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help me fund my new business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a new business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a minority staffed cannabis
concentrates extraction company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Lives Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote that joke Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kiss my ass if you don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm hogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody hand that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden you get the weed,
the joint, and the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm really just like, no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That joint, I'll give you your lighter
back too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will take your lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I leave the house with three lighters,
I come home with three lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not always the same three
lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the conservation of lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighters are neither created nor
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just spontaneously generated in
liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Costco's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting to that rambly point.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, there's probably some hash happening
this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever ramble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, see, I can smoke weed and come out
and tell jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I practice that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hash makes me rambly like an old
hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever hang out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those cats digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets tangential.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask him how to make a pie,
he'll tell you how to grow a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want my apple pie recipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been friends long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first ingredient is love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I know it sounds corny,
man, but people don't say it enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody acts like it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't start with love, it's never
going to taste right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So write that shit down first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with love, and then there's two
cups of apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend a cross or a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a mix of the Fuji and the Pink Lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fuji comes from Japan, which is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the older variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in Kazakhstan, which is the
birthplace of all apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Kazakhstan one time after
college, because I followed the Silk Road
[SPEAKER_00]: on my vision quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was there in this little hut that I
met this cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was like a Uyghur or a Uyghur
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all brown and crumbly and delicious
and kind of spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two teaspoons of cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just went on and on for days and days
and days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about crust, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you these seeds I got from
my friend Running Bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him at a rainbow gathering in
Wyoming in 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we stayed up all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did psilocybin and mescaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hybridized these gluten-free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they keep a flaky crust, because the
government's fucking up the food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look, what are your intentions with
this pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a pie of wooing or a pie of it
affects the nutmeg?
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me five years to actually make
that pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the best pie I'd ever had in my
life, because I was finally ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My tree had grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you sellers could hang on for the
end of that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it gets hard out there sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wade, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much cinnamon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a good cook, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a good cook because of weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will invent some shit to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have Bisquick and peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got peanut butter rolls coming in 10 to
12 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 to 14, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked in the pantry one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have marshmallows, margarine,
and top ramen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making ramen treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hella good, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use the flavor packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a savory dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you guys know what top ramen is,
because sometimes you get an upscale crowd
[SPEAKER_00]: in Bellevue or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to walk around Bellevue.
[SPEAKER_00]: People stare at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he a seahawk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recognize him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he's a coach.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of old to be on the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I say something about top ramen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just stare at me like, brrr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to break it down to a crowd once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, y'all know Cup of
Noodles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't afford a fucking cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to get old noodles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is day three of the Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been pretty much high for 72
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are like, woo, it's good for the
arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps my pretendinitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my stress levels down,
because getting arrested fucks with my
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me from inflaming on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are always like, pot smokers never
do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I always like to get high and
then do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always not like you get high and go
to Hempfest, or you get high and tell some
[SPEAKER_00]: jokes, or you get high and get some booty,
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Smokey Pokey is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm saying, I'm on the golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highest shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the secret about the golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golf course is like a little tiny
Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do pretty much whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever said, even in states where
weed is illegal, no one has ever said shit
[SPEAKER_00]: to me about my incessant use of marijuana
whilst on the links.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would they say?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go over to the gay
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that black guy with dreadlocks has a
bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a whiskey and a cigar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a blood and a diet coke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all having a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your head down.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time, I'm out on the links in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got paired up with this random
middle-aged white dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me and him on the golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right around the third hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was trying to smooth it out,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial it in, lock it down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pulled out a fat hoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the neighborly thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, you want a hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you have any crack?
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And might I add, I find your
presumptuousness somewhat off-putting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's how I talk when I'm mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, who the fuck smokes crack on
the golf course?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to help your swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right drug for the right activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed in golf makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Booze in golf makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack in golf don't make a lick of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't do a bunch of crank and go to a
chess tournament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't eat a bunch of mushrooms and try
to run a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean I'm off course?
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole planet is off course.
[SPEAKER_00]: See through your whole thing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I wearing a number?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't run a marathon on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take you three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laughing and crying the whole time,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Crying because your feet hurt and laughing
because you're happy to have feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how mushrooms work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They teach you the dichotomy, the
necessariness of the yin and the yang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why one must have a hint of the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it taught me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you just dance around like
assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is also cool.
