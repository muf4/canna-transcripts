[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to many events with thousands of
people and I have never seen such a
[SPEAKER_00]: community in my life and I thank you for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna pass it down so you just,
you don't get the whole bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you're thinking something about
what's in this bag and I know what's on
[SPEAKER_00]: your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State and Colorado have done
amazing things and it's not Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: State, for instance, it is the people of
Washington State, it is the people of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado who have moved forward with
legalization of marijuana in these two
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I applaud the people for coming out,
coming forward, making their voices heard
[SPEAKER_00]: and being organized in making it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, because that's key.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be organized if you want to
get something done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to reach out to your legislators
and your politicians and you have to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them do what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do that you have to be
organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have much more to say but two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, we all come here from many
different perspectives and for many
[SPEAKER_00]: different reasons for ending the
prohibition of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have one goal in mind and it's to
remove marijuana from the scheduling
[SPEAKER_00]: system in its entirety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not down one or two levels but completely
out of the scheduling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all come here for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to come together, work
together, make that happen and I know we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it in Washington, we've done it
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I ask of you as I close is to
help me take this steamroller because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it is completely across the
country all the way to my hometown of
[SPEAKER_00]: Baltimore, Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you with me on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will be here until it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it takes me to the age of 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you, each and every one of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Major Neil Franklin from Law
Enforcement Against Prohibition.
