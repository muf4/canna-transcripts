[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to prohibition, you have the
right not to remain silent, and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: we do Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: No man had guns or tanks or jails or
prisons ever going to stop the march of
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom and the song of justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with all the warts and all the
problems that we have here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States of America, us Americans,
we love our freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love our liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by golly, we haven't got enough of it
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 years ago, we used to hear this
thing that terrorists hate us for our
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not necessarily sure that's true,
but our answer was, well, if they hate us
[SPEAKER_00]: for our freedom, then let's really piss
them off and give us some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's legalize cannabis for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means repeal prohibition on the
federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean highly tax it,
restrict patients, close down
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, that doesn't mean piss
tests, be discriminated at your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not our version of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year we had two adult lounges here,
out of public view, where children
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't see people, fenced off,
where people 21 and over could go behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the fence and smoke their pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the view of kids, totally legal in
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our state legislature passed 2136,
Senate Bill 2136.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making it a Class C felony to have any
place for the purposes of using marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means no marijuana clubs,
no private clubs, no pot parties,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not legalization, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the state legislature that treats
cannabis like it's OxyContin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day I walk down the street,
the sidewalk, people smoking cigarettes
[SPEAKER_00]: like nothing with impunity everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though 400,000 people die directly
from using cigarettes this year in
[SPEAKER_00]: America, 400,000 people directly from
their use, even more from second-hand
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive down the street, you see people in
front of bars, on the patios, drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though over 40,000 people die from
alcohol-related illness, who knows how
[SPEAKER_00]: many people die from alcohol-related
violence, car accidents, suicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound like legalization to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure don't to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're going to keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I've asked probably 10
times for the media this week,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, why have a hemp vest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't pot legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is hemp vest really a need for it
anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really relevant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it ain't legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government could shut this all
down at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over in Germany last year in October,
they had Oktoberfest, where two million
[SPEAKER_00]: people celebrated the culture of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beer has always been legal in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when pot's completely legal,
we're going to keep doing hemp vest
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is a big cultural
celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our community, our family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deserve to have our own festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bud of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Tokleif.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bombershoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is THC Fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the most peaceful, nonviolent,
non-threatening culture on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are artistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make awesome music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make beautiful art.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make wonderful movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have beautiful families.
[SPEAKER_00]: We raise wonderful children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are one of the most beautiful cultures
on the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been pissed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been shit on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had our doors knocked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people pull us from our naked feet
on the ground, stick their foot on us,
[SPEAKER_00]: jackbooted people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in riot gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a laser bead on our chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a laser on our children's chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot our dog in our house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill our pets in our front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take us and throw us in jails and
prisons and cages like common thieves and
[SPEAKER_00]: criminals and murderers and rapists and
pedophiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have 50 Americans serving life in
prison for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life in prison for a herb that's never
killed anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can rain on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can come up hundreds of thousands of
dollars short in our donation bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make 18, 20 cents per person for
the whole weekend in our donation bins for
[SPEAKER_00]: 140 bands, 120 speakers, 400 vendors,
all for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, we can have all kinds of pot
organizations and magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they throw an after party or they do
something to try to profit off a hemp fest
[SPEAKER_00]: the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, how about a convention in
Tacoma on the same weekend as us,
[SPEAKER_00]: busing people to and from our event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of support we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this isn't freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have to sell our kidneys,
we're going to have hemp fest year after
[SPEAKER_00]: year after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can rain on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cars can break down on the way here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our staff can kill themselves 16,
18 hours a day in the drenching hot sun
[SPEAKER_00]: and then in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be here all night long freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as bad as being on chemotherapy
and not having pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as bad as being in a prison cell
and losing your freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as bad as seeing the old growth
forest destroyed needlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
