[SPEAKER_01]: We have a wonderful, fantastic speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's one of the, what are there,
four people left?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four people left in the United States that
actually gets her marijuana from the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the government tries to say,
well, marijuana has no medicinal value,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can say, bullshit, you got people on
the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to put your hands together and
welcome to the stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show your hip-stalk love for Elvie Musica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for putting on this wonderful
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you that have participated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to get a whole lot more
people here before 4 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came for a little ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that I was going to be
speaking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to see all of you and just say
hello and, and enjoy the fact that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of our cocoons and getting
together and expressing ourselves about
[SPEAKER_00]: God's most beautiful gift to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beautiful plant that should be our
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clothes we wear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my purse in this case should be is
my nutrition that keeps me healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention that it is my medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my eye pressures go up, when I
revisit all injuries that make me not walk
[SPEAKER_00]: so well for the summer that put us into
tons of marijuana rubbed on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two months later, I'm at the festival
and just to get inside here, you better
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you better walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got doors opening everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a governor that has he signed the
hand bill, which now are the seventh state
[SPEAKER_00]: to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stated that, you know, that was a good
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, they would be Oregonians would not
be far behind, but ahead of the curve
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he said that he expected other
aspects of this plan prohibition to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're all behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited that Oregon is thinking of an
I-28 and it is doing the other initiatives
[SPEAKER_00]: for regulation and taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's doing the hemp initiatives and I
will be out there hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's positive about cannabis
that gets on the ballot, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out there and we're going to vote for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, I guess it's getting into the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you will all participate in
whichever initiatives you're most familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with and want to help the most with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find time to work with all
three and I hope all three make it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really looking forward to that
kind of excitement next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that should and could and
ought to be happening now is that because
[SPEAKER_00]: we have doors opening, doors are open in
Washington DC, there is no excuse for a
[SPEAKER_00]: single one of us not to have contacted our
legislators and express our urgency in
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to end this hideous prohibition
that's unconstitutional, immoral,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a law against the creator's work,
which makes it a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for me, to arrest an adult for choosing
a wiser bud is the epitome of hypocrisy
[SPEAKER_00]: and we no longer have the time,
much less the money, to support such
[SPEAKER_00]: insanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your legislatures need to express to you
that they're not ignorant and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: change the course of history because,
as Jack Haier says, this plant has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: here to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The destruction we have done, cutting down
all those trees from paper, worthless
[SPEAKER_00]: paper that will disintegrate within 100
years, even if you keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the real paper, back to the real
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis hemp is a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will realize before this decade is
over, before even the next five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully the next year all over this
country, and Oregon could take the lead
[SPEAKER_00]: flag again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And show the world how this is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with California, the Northwest is
blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you, I thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the Northwest now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take good care.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the true spirit of love, I'll always be
your rockin' and guiding light wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
