[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what kind of energy we have
here tonight, collectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no use in wishing, hoping, and wanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those, if only, and those coulda,
shoulda, wouldas are just troubles for
[SPEAKER_01]: their head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And crying around about most anything is
just a waste of tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life doesn't put anything in front of us
that we can't handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in the handling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coherent or incoherent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clarity or chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing, everything that ever
happens is there to make us stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we understand, our strength gets
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we don't understand, our
weaknesses get stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an inevitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when falling down, falls down.
[SPEAKER_01]: When falling down, falls down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when getting back up, gets back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting back up, gets back up.
It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality waits for human recognition to
recognize the power of clear thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way of curing, healing,
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about whether we can or can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about whether we will or we won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blamers and the blames play a
dangerous game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making responsibility another one of their
casualties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Desperating.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the light cast by our shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life holds its breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Waiting for us to recognize the gift we
have been given.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a decision we make.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: No use wishing, hoping, wanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those, if only, and those coulda,
shoulda, woulda's are just troubles for
[SPEAKER_01]: the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And crying around about most things is
just a waste of tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It is what it is.
