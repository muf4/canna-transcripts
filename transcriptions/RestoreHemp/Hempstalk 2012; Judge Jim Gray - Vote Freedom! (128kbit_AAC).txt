[SPEAKER_00]: I am, as you heard, running for Vice
President of the United States of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to win this election with your
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most qualified person to be President
of the United States that I know of is a
[SPEAKER_00]: fellow by the name of Governor Gary
Johnson from New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor Gary Johnson has actually done
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: While he was governor, he stood up in 1999
and said the obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nation's war on drugs is not working
and it must be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The man has courage, he has insight,
he has integrity, and he goes for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support Governor Gary Johnson for
President.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's not enough, and it should
be, but if that's not enough, understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can elect Romney, you can elect
Obama.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them Robomney.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do elect either of them,
there won't be any medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries in our country within a year
or two from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: None.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to elect Governor Gary Johnson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only chance for survival for
medical marijuana dispensaries in our
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, something hugely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as a candidacy have endorsed the
initiative here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative 80 to treat marijuana like
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get this word out and we can't
do it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it alone, but together we can
get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure 80 has got to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not loud enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, did you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure 80 has got to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have endorsed both of those
initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've endorsed that initiative there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put it right to the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people of these states demand that
they be allowed to choose the way to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, let's treat it just like my drug of
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's treat it just like wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the answer to go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure you're convinced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need to go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: For heaven's sake, let's treat hemp like
cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just treat hemp which has valuable
uses and industrial uses all around the
[SPEAKER_00]: nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually squandering this
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're importing a billion dollars worth of
hemp every year from that radical country
[SPEAKER_00]: north of us called Canada, and we're
cheating our own people.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're at it, let's treat hemp like
cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: For heaven's sake, let's get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit our website, garyjohnson2012.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will like what you see, and if you do,
and when you do, take it personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pass that link onto your email world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take it personally, endorse this
candidacy, vote away from Grobomny,
[SPEAKER_00]: and vote for somebody that you actually
can vote for, understanding that voting
[SPEAKER_00]: for the lesser of two evils, you still get
evil, don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote for Governor Gary Johnson,
someone that you can vote for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your acquaintances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your family to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here to tell you, help is on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote for 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote for these initiatives in Colorado and
Washington, and for heaven's sake,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll always be proud to have voted for
Governor Gary Johnson and Judge Jim Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
