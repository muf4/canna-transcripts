[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with the safer shirts
ever since I read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is safer, so why are we driving
people to drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: By Steve Fox, Paul Armantano, Mason
Tavert, with Forward by retired Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: Police Chief, Norm Stamper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an occupational safety and health
professional, and I believe an employee
[SPEAKER_00]: who comes into work after a night of
drinking is more dangerous than an
[SPEAKER_00]: employee who comes into work after a night
of smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the reason why I'm working
with real legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the short sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably seen a petition that can
hold 20 signatures, somebody standing out
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of Walmart asking you to give the
chickens the larger cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with our petition, we also have
another option called the short sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only holds four signatures,
but it also folds into a its own envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a couple of signatures from
your friends, put a stamp on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mail it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instant activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out reallegalization.org and look
for safer shirts on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of information to be found
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the book, Marijuana is Safer,
so why are we driving people to drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming to Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.
