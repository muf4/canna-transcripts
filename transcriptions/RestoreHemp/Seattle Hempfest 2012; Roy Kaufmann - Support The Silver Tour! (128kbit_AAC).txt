[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather be here listening to Bobby
Plattschor and talk than to be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: here on his behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, our prohibition
policies are such that you cannot even
[SPEAKER_00]: educate as to an alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot even teach people there's
another way to think about this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, I'm here and Bobby's
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what Bobby's message is, is critical
to winning this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you care about this, if you care about
being able to come outside, go by the
[SPEAKER_00]: waterfront, use marijuana publicly with
your friends, with your family,
[SPEAKER_00]: without fear of provocation, without fear
of harassment, then you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the issue of ending
prohibitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are a senior, you need to be
involved in this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say it once, we cannot win this
issue without seniors on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot win this issue without seniors
on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, right here, if you have
grandparents, if you have parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have family friends, you cannot be
afraid to approach them and talk to them
[SPEAKER_00]: about this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to educate your parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to educate your grandparents
because they vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: They donate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they get on board, this thing will
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen in Colorado and it will
happen in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after this November, we'll go after
the rest of the states in this union.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll legalize marijuana in the United
States of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to thesilvertour.org, thesilvertour
.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Bobby Plattshorn is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he can't be here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's reaching out to seniors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put together a road show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the hippest road show on the senior
circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes to senior citizen homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes to retirement centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes to community centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes to churches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you have been misled your
entire lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have been lied to your entire lives,
and you have believed it because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: not your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the Silver Tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the Oregon Measure 80 website,
octo2012.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an issue battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a war we are fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we cannot win right now,
we are going to be set back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an absolutely critical time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are living in historic times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are living in a moment of history in
the United States of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended prohibition of alcohol last
century because of the bad policy that
[SPEAKER_00]: created organized crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to end prohibition of marijuana in
the 21st century because it's a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's bad for Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to thesilvertour.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to octo2012.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out to your parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out to your grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show courage, they'll show courage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together we can legalize marijuana in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Go to octo2012.org.
