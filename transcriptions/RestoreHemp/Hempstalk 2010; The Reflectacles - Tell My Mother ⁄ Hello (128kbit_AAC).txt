I'm not beaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not dead just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell my mother, if you see it,
I'm alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so pleased to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you should see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me standing alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wave goodbye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll smile like I didn't need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't give it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be on my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a ghost.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the signs that I'll leave and
never see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could stitch up my whole heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still fall apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so pleased to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you should see me standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standing alone.
Just wave goodbye.
And I'll smile like I didn't need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't give it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll pass on
[SPEAKER_01]: these stars and storms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're all for a song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so pleased to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you should see me standing alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wave goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll smile like I didn't need to.
And I'll be on my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't give it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be on my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see what you're missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it could get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're still afraid.

[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, because we could get out there.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're still afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll step out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, step out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see what you're missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it could get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're still afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're on in a song.
