[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is a song about us,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are many, and we are strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are many, and we are strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can so many be so wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving in to many lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't anybody really care why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it be that we are right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we be peaceful through this fight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we really want to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Humanity set free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just one big family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once united, we are free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the time to make a stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the best that each one can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one big family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once united, we are free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the time to make a stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the best that each one can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once awakened, we will see the potential
of infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And abundance will be the norm when we are
finally through the storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it be that we are right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we be peaceful through this fight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we really want to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: This humanity set free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one big family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once united, we are free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the time to make a stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the best that each one can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one big family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once united, we are free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the time to make a stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the best that each one can.
Now's the time to make a stand.
Now's the time to make a stand.
And abundance will be the norm when we are
finally through the storm.
