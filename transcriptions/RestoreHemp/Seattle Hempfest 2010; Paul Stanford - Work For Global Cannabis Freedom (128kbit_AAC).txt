[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready for 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys ready for 420 now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, T-minus 45 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to stop the lies about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused so much suffering in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of our brothers and sisters are in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know Mark Emory?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got his picture right up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Roger Christie, a Reverend who is
doing religious work in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's being held without bail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying he's never been arrested
for cannabis before or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's 61 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying he's a danger to the
community and they won't let him out on
[SPEAKER_00]: bail and they're holding him until next
April for a trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll probably be out for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoken on this stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been held for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to let our people go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 32 years ago, I went to a rally that
was much like this one right in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: the White House.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the White House smoke in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organized by the Yippies and Dana Beale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got me motivated and involved in the
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 30 years ago, I was Washington State
Normal Coordinator and helped organize the
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 1984, I moved from Washington,
Oregon to help the Oregon Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put an initiative on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost pretty overwhelmingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 84 as well, Jack Herr moved to
Oregon from Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put together his book while working
on the Marijuana Initiative in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave one of his last speeches here last
year in the heat of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Jack's book basically
catalyzed us all, changed us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack's book motivated untold scores of
people to get out there and work for
[SPEAKER_00]: global cannabis freedom and restore
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book brought the whole picture into
focus about hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now we know and can see
marijuana catalyzed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana motivates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I studied Chinese for a couple years and
went to school in China and started
[SPEAKER_00]: importing hemp fabric and hemp paper back
in the early 90s and had a company,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree Free Eco Paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sold hemp paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started and continue to produce a live
weekly television show, Cannabis Common
[SPEAKER_00]: Sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plays on cable here in Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also started and today run THCF,
the Hemp and Cannabis Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to being the sponsors
here, perhaps most importantly THCF has
[SPEAKER_00]: helped almost 150,000 people all across
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Detroit, Michigan and Marquette,
Michigan out to Kapa'a, Hawaii and
[SPEAKER_00]: Honolulu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Become legal medical marijuana patients
where they can legally possess,
[SPEAKER_00]: use and grow their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know why it goes much deeper than
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis hemp is deeper than its
incredibly long taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis hemp catalyzed human
civilization itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana jump-started human civilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: All archaeologists agree that cannabis was
a much of the first crops purposely grown
[SPEAKER_00]: by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 12,000 years ago, people began
growing hemp and its cultivation spread
[SPEAKER_00]: from the high Himalayas of Tibet and Nepal
and Pakistan and Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it spread down to the valleys,
the Yellow River Valley in China,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Huanghe Valley and to the Tigris and
Euphrates Valley in Iraq.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the cradles of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, marijuana could very well be the
whole reason that our ancestors gave up
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting and gathering and started
agricultural settlements so they could
[SPEAKER_00]: have their stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I believe that cannabis is the
most sacred gift from the creator to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the holiest of the holy gifts
from our mother earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every part of cannabis hemp is highly
useful for the diverse multitude of our
[SPEAKER_00]: deeds and the needs of human civilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one plant capable of taking
care of most of human civilization's deeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we restore marijuana to its rightful
place, industrial hemp to its rightful
[SPEAKER_00]: place in our economy, we're going to see
marijuana fuel and a great deal of our
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel and energy needs are going to be made
from the seeds of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana seed oil running diesel engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana stems produce most of our
fiber, can produce most of our fiber for
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing, paper, building materials and it
can wipe out deforestation and stop a
[SPEAKER_00]: great deal of our pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp seeds produce more and healthier oil
and protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp protein and oils are rich in the
essential fatty acids and EFAs that our
[SPEAKER_00]: brain and cardiovascular system need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana seeds make omega-3, 6 and 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the perfect ratio for human
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hemp protein from marijuana seeds
makes all eight of the amino acids that
[SPEAKER_00]: our body needs, again, in just the right
ratio for human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: When marijuana seed oil ages and goes
rancid, it's no longer useful for food but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a productive biodiesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take that oil port right into any
diesel engine and it's going to run it
[SPEAKER_00]: with no conversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The engine are the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can synthesize it into gasoline
and plastic, anything petroleum can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only healthy for us, it can solve
our world energy problems and wipe out a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp stalks, the stems, are the most
productive source of fiber on earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: making 10 tons of fast fiber for canvas,
rope, lace and linen and 25 tons of curd
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber for paper, building materials per
acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way back in 1916, the United States
Department of Agriculture put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: bulletin, bulletin 404, said a waste
product for making canvas, rope,
[SPEAKER_00]: lace and linen from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That waste product makes four times more
paper than the most productive cheese
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture back there in
World War II put out a video called Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: for Victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed farmers how to reintroduce
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the seeds in the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we need these seeds in the
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp flowers make human brain chemicals or
neurotransmitters and medicines that help
[SPEAKER_00]: fight cancer, multiple sclerosis,
neurodegenerative diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: gastrointestinal disorders, relieves pain,
helps glaucoma, stops seizures and spasms
[SPEAKER_00]: and restores balance in the body,
restores homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers of hemp will also make you
laugh, make you feel good and relieve
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, post-traumatic stress and
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe that hemp is our Mother
Earth's greatest gift to humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the forces of ignorance,
evil and darkness are afoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laws against marijuana are just plain
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana prohibitions a conspiracy from
the wealthy of this world to feed us
[SPEAKER_00]: poisonous petrochemical products.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we legalize marijuana, hemp will
create untold multitude of jobs and return
[SPEAKER_00]: economic control to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more wars for petroleum when we start
to use hemp again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, hemp can lead the way to economic
and ecological sustainability and help
[SPEAKER_00]: save the remnants of our biosphere's
precious heritage for future generations
[SPEAKER_00]: and the seventh generation and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right now, cannabis freedom is
dawning with boats across the West.
[SPEAKER_00]: California's Prop 19 is a groundbreaking
step to legalize possession cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow a small amount of herb and allow
it's sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon's medical marijuana dispensary
ballot will create jobs and help patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in Arizona and South Dakota,
they're going to allow medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: in a vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in closing, I just want to say that we
have to stop the drug war before they kick
[SPEAKER_00]: in your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to work together to legalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those facing execution, for
anti-cannabis laws in Malaysia and
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere, you've got to work for global
cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those languishing in jails and
prisons, for the anti-cannabis laws out
[SPEAKER_00]: there everywhere, we've got to work for
global cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our forests and the web of life and
our mother earth, which suffers from the
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and poisoning of our
environment, we've got to work for global
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for economic and political justice,
we've got to work for global cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our brothers and sisters and all that
have fallen before us, like Jack Herr,
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd McMear, so many of us, we've got to
work for global cannabis freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, hip, marijuana, I believe,
is truly the healing of the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let our people grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restore hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hip for victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
Yay!
Yay!
Thank you.
