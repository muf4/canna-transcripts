[SPEAKER_02]: John Lucy, Law420.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I represent Anonymous as well as Occupy as
well as the global cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm here today to do is something
really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to help you protect your rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to read a little bit of
information that's on every single one of
[SPEAKER_02]: my business cards back in front that you
need to know when you deal with the cops
[SPEAKER_02]: or you deal with anyone who's trying to
get you in front of the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really simple and I want you to
listen and repeat it back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a little call and
response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody know how to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody got that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember to be polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the critical part of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a jerk to the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hate it more than anything when you
know your rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not wish to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invoke my right to silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish to consult with my attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you remember this, you'll
probably never pay me a dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not wish to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invoke my right to silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish to consult with my attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish to consult with my attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't remember that, I've got
wristbands.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just say, I want my lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cards are over there if anybody needs
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I've got a client in
custody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go over to the jail and take care
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how John Lucy does, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always working.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always working for freedom and
supporting the many, many great and
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful activists, patients,
and people that we have in this cannabis community.
