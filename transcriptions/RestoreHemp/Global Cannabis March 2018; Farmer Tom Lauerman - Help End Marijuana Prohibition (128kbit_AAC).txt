[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everybody showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't show up, we don't blow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we encourage everybody to get out to
all the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Represent and make sure that we can hold
the people who got this industry moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can all transition into this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These green rushers are moving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to like wipe us all out for
pennies on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been their plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really have no heart and soul into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go out there and spend your
hard earned money on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: support the stores and support the
locations that support the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: brought you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long road for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was part of the first collective
garden in San Diego in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our collective got a rated in San Diego in
1999, where I was arrested for 448 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's done a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of energy into this and we
need to get something back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we really need to hold on to our
medical laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be seeing what happened in
Washington is a disgrace to medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really a disgrace to all the
efforts that everybody put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same people who fought against this
tooth and nail, Inslee and all the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: us who fought against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll go to the death to protect the
tax dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plan really worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plan was to like get them addicted to
the money and then we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spreading across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: States are lining up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all want to cash in on it,
but we still need to show up at these
[SPEAKER_00]: events and let our voice be heard to make
sure that the small guys and the small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and the craft farmers don't get
wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big talk now is the race to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we saw the race to the bottom coming
years ago because there's big corporations
[SPEAKER_00]: already out there who are ready to lose 30
to $50 million to create market to capture
[SPEAKER_00]: market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go out there, make conscious
choices on what you buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy organic, buy clean, buy local,
just like we do here in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do the same for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about the dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower the price, the probably the
crappier weed you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So support your local growers,
organic growers, and keep on showing up at
[SPEAKER_00]: the events and show up on a regular basis
and you could really make a change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for everybody coming
out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank normal and parents for pod
and Paul Sanford and their group and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody for keeping Oregon on,
you know, going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Anna Diaz for kind of
being the backbone here and Madeline
[SPEAKER_00]: Martinez and all of these people who have
really brought us here today and got us
[SPEAKER_00]: through legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for supporting
cannabis in Oregon and show up and blow
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
