[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing up L.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musica, one of the only living members of
a government program.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets marijuana from the federal
government in the mail each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: L.B., welcome to Seattle Hymn Fest,
darlin'.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back!
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back!
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back!
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking forward to the day we come
back here to celebrate that loss at last,
[SPEAKER_01]: a thing of the past, when it comes to our
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it was as simple as just waiting
for the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, unfortunately, they make me go to
Florida at least once a year, hang out
[SPEAKER_01]: there for a month or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at the height of winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind that too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to pick up my marijuana grown in
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot be mailed to me to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I have doctors here, I have to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're all working on so many
issues all around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhode Island, of course, being the latest
state that already has medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: and has dispensaries, and they are very
happy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have 15 states, and when these
elections are over, no telling how many
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there are several things going on
with initiatives in my state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have dispensaries, and it's hard
to find your medicine when the mites get
[SPEAKER_01]: your growers' crop, or when, for whatever
reason, you just can't be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're traveling, think of the
convenience of stopping somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your card with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stop and choose a medicine that
will suit you for that particular part of
[SPEAKER_01]: your journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all very wonderful that we get
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we got a good administration,
and we got a holder who we certainly have
[SPEAKER_01]: educated right here in Seattle all these
years from the Justice Department.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is handing out rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making decisions for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more important than ever that we get
in touch with our legislators and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time for a hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely passed it in Oregon so that
marijuana is a schedule two, not a
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule one drug, so that's against the
lie that we are propagating from Mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nixon's time still on to now, and which
could be wiped out with one executive
[SPEAKER_01]: order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your president needs to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people trying to help,
and Gaspar on the radio has gotten Ed
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosenthal to finance a project in which
some of the legal smokers and I will go to
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington with Mary Lynn Madrigs,
who's one of the co-founders of Patience
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of Time, and trying to explain to our
legislators that we cannot continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: uphold this prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's causing too much pain, too much
heartache.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many medicines right now that
are being patented using parts or some of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is medicine, and everyone knows
that now, but the most exciting things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going on, as Rick Simpson showed
us at the beginning of this year with his
[SPEAKER_01]: tape run from The Cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, now there's a newer tape that
really goes into all the leads about
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer and cannabis, and there is no way
to ignore this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scientific evidence anymore,
so we really need to present it and make
[SPEAKER_01]: it clear to our legislators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need our health back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to have this many cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have plenty of pure hemp seed
oil like they do in Finland, and cancer is
[SPEAKER_01]: prevented because it leaves the coat
protecting your immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manitoba here makes wonderful non-narcotic
hemp seed oil that we should also take.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am concerned about California and their
new law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when it puts so many more
restrictions on the bad laws we already
[SPEAKER_01]: have, making them worse, there's no way I
could go for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to what you're doing,
and keep it moving, keep it going strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that you are part of the largest
majority of people, that's right,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no segment in your community that
doesn't have bad smokers, whether you only
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out with judges, doctors,
nurses, any other professionals,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whether you don't have a professional
goal at all, but you're an entrepreneur
[SPEAKER_01]: and you do well with your life,
or whether you're doing nothing,
[SPEAKER_01]: chances are you know people who smoke if
you don't smoke yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for me to leave you,
but I gotta remind you that as I travel,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I have done every state in the United
States and several countries, the only
[SPEAKER_01]: opposition I ever find is from the
pharmaceutical industries, the insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: industries, and most of all the corrupt
prison system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody misquoted me and said the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always been good to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the true spirit of love always be your
guiding light, and I hope next year we
[SPEAKER_01]: come to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vivian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Musiqa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show your love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Musiqa.
