[SPEAKER_00]: We lost Dennis Perrone this last year,
and he was the father of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, and he was around with the
Harvey Milk crowd and all that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, so I feel safe in saying what I'm
about to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Anthony Taylor, and I'm here to
recruit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need every patient on this square to
come up and talk to me about how they can
[SPEAKER_00]: come to the Commission and talk to the
Commission, because this Commission needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear from patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to hear from patients at every
meeting they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to hear from patients when they
go on the listening tour, and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, you have to get all your
friends and all your grower friends to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick with the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're down to 45,000 patients right now,
and that's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fee-based program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the fees go away, the program goes
away, so renew your goddamn cards and get
[SPEAKER_00]: your growers to stick with growing for
patients, and quit jumping the fence and
[SPEAKER_00]: going to OLCC, where everything is upside
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the Oregon Health Authority is
proposing to limit medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to three immature plants below 24
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even grow radishes like that,
let alone a fragile plant, a fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that's really helping three or
four-year patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, stay abreast of what's going on with
the OHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rules Advisory Committee is meeting on
Monday, and after that, they'll establish
[SPEAKER_00]: the public comment period, which is about
30 days of being able to write in and
[SPEAKER_00]: express your concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't get that number for immature
plants up to about 15 to 1, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little bit of a revolution,
because I'm going to call on all you
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and all you growers to help us
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first paid marijuana lobbyist in
this state in 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it off and on for a long
time, and I will tell you that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: your help in the legislature, but what I
have avoided doing because of my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in the legislature and because
I know that when you go speak to the
[SPEAKER_00]: committee, you get two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not willing to ask patients that are
in wheelchairs in oxygen 24-7 or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital bed in an assisted living
facility to come in and participate in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to ask them to sit on a
commission that has to struggle through
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and hours of debate to come up with
good rules to help these, but I am going
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask them to come to the listening tour
for the Oregon Cannabis Commission that
[SPEAKER_00]: will probably happen this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your voices heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're down to 45,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot let this continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in crisis mode, and without patient
help, without the patient voice,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to lose our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done all I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassionate Oregon has added PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added persistent and degenerative
neurological conditions, so now you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get a cannabis card for spectral disorders
and lupus and Lyme disease and ALS,
[SPEAKER_00]: so stick with the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we're going to lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a year or so on this commission to
get things turned around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the only cannabis commissioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on the Oregon Cannabis Commission,
which Compassionate Oregon had enacted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2017 session.
[SPEAKER_00]: This commission was put together to
address medical patient concerns right up
[SPEAKER_00]: front.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the concerns about doctors not
giving us the appropriate medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kicking us off pain management
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're telling us we can't be daycare
providers because we have a card.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't be on a transplant list,
and if we are on a transplant list,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't be active users of cannabis
that's saving our damn lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, patients, you've got to come to the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't hold them back any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take over this program,
and you will be at the mercy of the Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquor Control Commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the rest of your day.
