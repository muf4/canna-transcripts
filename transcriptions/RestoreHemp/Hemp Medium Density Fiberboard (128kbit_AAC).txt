[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe things like this will help
stop deforestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hemp fiber board produced at
Washington State University by the Wood
[SPEAKER_00]: Science Labs, and they've shown that it's
the strongest fiber board they've
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually stronger than steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we think that once we cultivate
industrial hemp, we'll slow or reverse the
[SPEAKER_00]: deforestation and environmental
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plant has been suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the industrial hemp will transform our
economy and stop the use of petroleum to a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide degree as it is used today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that that's really the key
crucial element of cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we were sold the marijuana myth
back 70 years ago is to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will reverse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it will also allow adults to grow
their own, and just as people can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: their own tobacco or alcohol products.
So we believe that that's the key crucial
element of cannabis prohibition.
