[SPEAKER_00]: Probably be at least another year,
year and a half before we see stores open
[SPEAKER_00]: in Washington, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think in terms of your state,
Agua?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I believe that five nanograms is a
totally inappropriate standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for, yeah, driving to the five
nanograms because I don't know if your
[SPEAKER_01]: cameras can get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get a camera to close in on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But five nanograms is a totally
inappropriate standard because at five
[SPEAKER_01]: nanograms a driver is still five percent
safer than a totally sober driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, okay, so you can see the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lower line is the five nanogram level.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, let's see, this is sober driver
and there's five nanograms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find that at two and a half nanograms
a driver is 30 percent safer than a sober
[SPEAKER_01]: driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at five nanograms, they're still five
percent safer than a sober driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they should not be punished for being
at that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the detectable level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Colorado, they're attempting and
they don't have it in place yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're attempting to establish that the
presence of five nanograms of THC is used
[SPEAKER_01]: as evidence of other drug use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're basing that on the Washington
law, which just kind of plucked it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally inappropriate.
Alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the level of impairment at,
you know, zero point eight at point zero
[SPEAKER_01]: eight point zero eight blood alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of evidence that drivers are
six to ten times more likely to be in an
[SPEAKER_01]: accident or traffic fatality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the level of impairment that
corresponds to point zero eight blood
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: The voters said that they wanted to
regulate marijuana like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the level of impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody is impaired to this level,
they should not be on the road no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was Colorado's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the actual name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulate marijuana like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the main central battle cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what voters were calling for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's amendment sixty four in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's an amendment to the Colorado
Constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't they give it a lot of extra weight
in judicial proceeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it means that anything that departs
from regulating marijuana like alcohol is
[SPEAKER_01]: a violation of the Colorado state
constitution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want to wait until you go to
an appellate court in order for this to be
[SPEAKER_01]: torn down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be stopped where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that... But it hasn't passed in
Colorado's legislature yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Senate voted it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said they're very concerned about
impaired drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're more concerned about punishing
non-impaired drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
