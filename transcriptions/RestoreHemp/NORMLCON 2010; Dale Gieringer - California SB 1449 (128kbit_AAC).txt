[SPEAKER_01]: Next, we'd like to ask Dale Garriger to
talk for a second about a new bill that
[SPEAKER_01]: recently passed the California
legislature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still pending before the
governor, but it would, in fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: finally do what we thought we had done
back in 1977, which is to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as Dale will fill you in in more
detail, it turns out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're still arresting 60,000 or more
marijuana smokers every year in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a major step forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of you know Dale.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the coordinator and has been for a
dozen, 15 years of California Normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a co-author of a book called
Marijuana Medical Handbook, published in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1997 and, again, updated in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's vice chairman of the Normal Board of
Directors and was the 2004 recipient of
[SPEAKER_01]: Normal's Lester Grinspoon Award,
recognizing outstanding work in medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis advocacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dale Garriger, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have actually, for the first time in
many years, good news coming out of our
[SPEAKER_00]: state legislature in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bill to decriminalize petty possession,
that is, possession of less than an ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana, to an infraction,
like a traffic ticket, has cleared both
[SPEAKER_00]: houses of the legislature and is now on
the governor's desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our good news friend, state senator
Mark Leno, deserves credit for sponsoring
[SPEAKER_00]: this bill, SB 1449, it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that petty
possession is already not a criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: offense in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not actually technically the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, possession of an ounce or
less is now a very minor misdemeanor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one which requires you to go to court
and which in itself is quite an
[SPEAKER_00]: inconvenience and gives you a technical
criminal record for a misdemeanor for
[SPEAKER_00]: actually just two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: After two years, it's expunged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mere threat of a misdemeanor
charge can be a big problem for lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, many people don't even
plead out to the maximum fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, there's a hundred dollar fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no possible jail with the current
misdemeanor marijuana possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to avoid the possibility of a
record, a lot of people will spend
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds or thousands of dollars to go to
these treatment classes, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: diversion program that can avoid the
technical misdemeanor conviction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is all a lot of nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other misdemeanor in California
that does not have a jail sentence
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have to go to court for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is costing the state quite a bit
of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you got 60,000 petty
possession offenders last year in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, that's 60,000 court cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much a court hearing
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the state court system doesn't
know either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's somewhere in the hundreds of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can tell right off the bat the
state is spending millions of dollars on
[SPEAKER_00]: hauling these people into court
needlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator Leno managed to get support from
the district attorneys and the California
[SPEAKER_00]: court system for this bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think it is the support of the
district attorneys that made it possible
[SPEAKER_00]: to pass the bill in the first place
because identical legislation has been up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the state legislature three times in
the last dozen years or so and never
[SPEAKER_00]: managed to pass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time it passed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But given the fiscal crisis and given that
it does save millions of dollars in court
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses and would save marijuana
offenders any criminal record whatsoever
[SPEAKER_00]: for petty possession, there's a really
strong case for this to be signed into
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are crossing our fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor Schwarzenegger does not have a
good record on marijuana legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, he has vetoed every bill that we
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with the support of the district
attorneys in courts and with the budget
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis we have, we think there's a very,
very strong case now for the governor to
[SPEAKER_00]: sign this bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are urging everybody to contact the
governor Schwarzenegger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do so via the normal or California
normal websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shall know by the end of the month what
the verdict is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that if it does pass,
it is signed into law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also have nice implications for
Proposition 19 because without it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if Proposition 19 passes, petty marijuana
offenses like using marijuana in public or
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of children would remain a
misdemeanor under Prop 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the Leno bill passes, it would only
be a fraction and there would be no cause
[SPEAKER_00]: for criminal action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hope that the governor signs SB
1449.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
