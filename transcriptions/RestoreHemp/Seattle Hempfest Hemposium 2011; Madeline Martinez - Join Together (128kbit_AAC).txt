[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Madeleine Martinez, and I am the
executive director of Oregon Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the board of directors of Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also the owner of the world famous
cannabis cafe in Potland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty amazing place, a bit of a
change in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also the chief petitioner for
Sensible Oregon, which is a statutory
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative that we are trying to right now
just garner a ballot title.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real struggle without dollars,
as everybody knows is on this panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every little dollar helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's getting out there as Rick Steves
and Alison said, and actually going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: constituency, to the town hall meetings,
and presenting yourself in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: light, taking the focus off of your
attire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ring in your nose and all these
different things, and just try to look as
[SPEAKER_00]: much like them as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it takes that fear factor away
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really questioning 502,
and I listened to Alison, and I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Steves and Alison really put a
dynamic presentation together to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: logic and the rationale, although I'm a
medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm very concerned about growing
your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to say that right up front on
502.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty inspirational myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty amazed at what they had to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, moving on to what we're doing
in Oregon, Sensible Oregon is really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes all civil and criminal
penalties for the cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the transportation, the use, the
possession of marijuana for adults only,
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 and older.
[SPEAKER_00]: It retains the DUII laws, and it also
retains the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's a huge concern for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we certainly do not want to stress
anyone out, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the inspirational initiatives that
are going on across the country are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved a couple of cycles before
with the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I've signed the petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, I think that any reform is great
reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any move forward, it's hard to have
conflicting, or a lot of people think of
[SPEAKER_00]: it as, let's say, competing initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we all have to come to the
realization, I've learned, that reform is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we cannot stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even as our law enforcement and the
attorney generals of this country,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even President Obama himself,
have found, it's not a good idea to go up
[SPEAKER_00]: against us, because we're a mighty force
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people would stand up and vote,
and let their voices be heard,
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna Odia is here in the audience,
is one of the ladies that I've taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she gets out over 1,000
communications with our legislature here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the state level, as well as at the
federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they give you the money to join
your membership, and what we do is we turn
[SPEAKER_00]: around and utilize it to inspire them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna writes a short, brief sentence or
two, and we go, hey, everybody signed this
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna make a difference if nothing
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna teach people how to be
proactive, as all of you do, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that's the most
inspirational part of normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, you can never
[SPEAKER_00]: change anything unless you educate the
masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at the Cannabis Cafe, we've had law
enforcement walk downstairs and sit down
[SPEAKER_00]: with my son, Rafael, and myself,
right in our little living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have little, I don't know how many of
you have been to the Cannabis Cafe?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty amazing place.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk downstairs and you realize
that you are in another world,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is pretty amazing, the big puffs of
smoke that Rick talked about in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to go to Amsterdam this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty excited about seeing the huge
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that we all have to take from
this hemp fest, especially this panel,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things that you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the, I'm not sure I can get
your name, but you talked about the no
[SPEAKER_00]: issue with driving under the influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Supreme Court in Massachusetts
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when you take all the
pieces of this and then the next cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: we work on something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our state, we have Okta, as I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tax and regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a great, I mean,
anywhere you can get it on the books,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is inspirational.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a constitutional amendment
brought by OMPI, the Oregon Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Policy Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Wolf and Michael Kleinman are
bringing that to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, if they can get it
passed, I think it's a high hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can do it, hey, I'm there with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get to regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get, I don't use the outward
anymore because it totally throws people
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about legalization and a
town hall meeting, everybody kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gets a little concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you say regulation, I found that
that is really a good word to use because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody wants regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want kids walking around smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grandkids, you know, but I think
that we have to really not whirl with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and be more united in the sense of
you don't have to like them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't like each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Republicans and Democrats,
the independent, you know, we all,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all have issues with, you know,
with others, but it's just part of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do because that's why so many
other groups get forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and you know, I don't happen to be
a Christian, but they have massive masses,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's masses of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, you know, I was proud and lucky
and honored enough to march with the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that came out, my people for
immigration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have seen a Mexican march,
we had the horses out and say the law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement was out on bikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, well, you would have
thought that Obama was there or even
[SPEAKER_00]: worse, you know, Saddam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, whoa, I've never seen anything
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because the Mexicans were marching
on immigration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you feel about that,
but I sure would like to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to explain to them, as I do
everywhere I go, that this is our war,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is a war against people of color
and we need to stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm also one of the co-founders
of the Normal Women's Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge step, ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out there and you're just
kicking back raising kids, I know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult, but try to give some of your
volunteer time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have that, chip away a
few dollars from your budget so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can help make something bigger than
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, Amadeus right here is this
year's winner of the Pauline Saban Award.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know the history of
Pauline Saban, but Pauline Saban was a
[SPEAKER_00]: woman who really led, she spearheaded the
end of alcohol, of prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, prohibition is not
patriotic and we need to get that point
[SPEAKER_00]: across, that it wastes away at law
enforcement dollars and all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: country's resources at every level with
corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a retired peace officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you what, right now as a
Speaker for Law Enforcement Against
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition, as I walk the halls of the
women's penitentiary, as we used to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it back in the day, state prison,
pretty high security, I mean we had some
[SPEAKER_00]: really heavy hitters in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you could smell marijuana wafting
through the halls as I went to count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was smoking a bowl or a joint or
something in the state prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of pissed because I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is, you can't even keep it
out of a high security prison with
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantina wire, you know, big old mini
14s at the towers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We search people coming in, we search
people going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be there and they're never
gonna stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of a point that I don't
think we need to scare them with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think that we need to make sure that
they understand that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never gonna stop us from smoking,
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never gonna stop us from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I listen to Rick and I listen to
Allison, they're not gonna stop me from
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they gonna stop you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we chip away at that law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that every chip is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana, I love it, it's a
beautiful thing, but it's really been hard
[SPEAKER_00]: on the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see women come to me, and this is a
really sore spot with me as a mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she can't see her children for four
months except supervised because she's a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: How good is that law?
[SPEAKER_00]: How good is that law?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these laws are beautiful
things, but we need to realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's gonna fall through those
cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veterans I see who don't want to be on
300 milligrams of morphine, that's a true
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they feel their pride, they want to
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that we all be
protected, because a lot of these people
[SPEAKER_00]: can have it if you're a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the veteran administration people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just this huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each chip, I like to just let everybody
know it's a really important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be thoughtful when you criticize other
initiatives you don't agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're sometimes our own worst
enemies, as Donnie knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have to say, Alison Holcomb is a
wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are all the other people that
really have thought, let's change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were not happy with me when I
opened the cannabis cafe, and some still
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sorry if you're offended,
but oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are offended by the smell
of pop that comes out of my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people were just jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I heard, yeah, that's what I
think, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I had to have a picture with
my mayor, Sam Adams, and he's not the most
[SPEAKER_00]: popular guy in the world, I must say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, he's done some good for the
city, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weighed the good and the bad ass with
Obama now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really happy about it,
but I just chipped off $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with my other option, I think he
might still be workable, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a scary situation that you have to
weigh in balance with your options though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to break in with the League of
Women Voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you ladies out there, join the normal
women's alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go online, and you can find out
how you can stand up, buckle up your bra
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get out there and represent women.
[SPEAKER_00]: Represent yourself, soccer moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a PTA mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I used to make cupcakes,
and I used to be getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if anyone's offended,
but we can do all these things and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: be all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to present ourselves,
and if you're gonna go do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other people that aren't gonna do
that, and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need all the people, you moms that
are raising your kids, we just need a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of your computer time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you gotta do is do some stuff from
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all do that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's face it, but as I always
say, put the joint down, step away from
[SPEAKER_00]: your bond, and get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanna know more about Sensible
Oregon, you can go to sensibleoregon.org
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can talk to our campaign manager,
Anna Diaz or myself, and I'd love to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about anything else you wanna know.
Thank you.
Thank you.
