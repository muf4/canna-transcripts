[SPEAKER_00]: If you free the plant, you'll free the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irv Rosenfeld is the longest surviving
medical marijuana patient in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the published author of My Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a warm Seattle welcome to Irv
Rosenfeld.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Irv.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody at this hemp
festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great job they put on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They worked very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like they said, a few dollars in the
pot would help them bring this back next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, my name's Irv Rosenfeld.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the longest surviving federal medical
cannabis patient in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal government's been giving me
marijuana for the last 28 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I receive over 120,000 medical cannabis
cigarettes so far from the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've always tried to be very
responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see me on documentaries or on the
news shows, you usually see me with a coat
[SPEAKER_01]: and tie on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you're talking about medical
cannabis, you want to look better than the
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd that you're with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, I could dress like this today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is, you've got to be
responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use cannabis in
whatever way you use it, and if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: use it responsibly, then you're giving me
a bad name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you know what cannabis does
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it puts you in a position where
you're lethargic and don't feel like doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something, then don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put yourself in that position when
you have to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it makes you creative, makes you a
better person in your thoughts,
[SPEAKER_01]: well then when you've got work to do,
nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to know what it does to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I came all the way from Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time that I've been here
in this crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I must say, I'm very impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do hope that they're able to carry
this on and carry it next year and the
[SPEAKER_01]: year after that and many years to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be with all of y'all's
help out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, being the longest surviving federal
patient, I realized that the history of
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical marijuana movement,
I helped start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I planted the seeds in the early 70s for
what you see here today in all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that if I died,
all that information would die with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been very fortunate to be able to
get a federal patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to win the struggles,
the trials, the tribulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 10 year struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sat down and I wrote a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the book is called My Medicine,
because that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm hoping that this book will teach
the American public that they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the face of, when they think about
marijuana, they think of some no good
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever person sitting back just wanting
to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here I am in a coat and tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm a financial advisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm senior vice president.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I teach disabled people how to sail
boats in Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been married for 37 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all this because I have the right
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people out here, y'all have the right
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's only 40% of the country right
now that's under state laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the rest to come and join us to be
able to enjoy the freedom, the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom that we have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm going to go back to Florida
with is a picture of freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of being able to see people that can do
what they want to do, medically speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as they not harm others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I finish speaking, I'm going to be
out down here in the front of the stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be doing book signings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, the booth I'm in is a 420 booth,
which is an Empire booth, number 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you all come there, get an
autographed copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind, they're going to be
bringing a festival here in March right to
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's something that you all
want to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to everybody here again, thank you so
much for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank the sponsors, the band, the
organizers, the people that clean up,
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realize, y'all are just walking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't cost you anything to walk in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's provided for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you've got to pay for your food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to pay for water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But think of everything that's been done
for you by other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see that bucket go around,
you've got to reach in and you've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: give them something.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's also very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, please be responsible and use
cannabis correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Herb Rosenfeld.
