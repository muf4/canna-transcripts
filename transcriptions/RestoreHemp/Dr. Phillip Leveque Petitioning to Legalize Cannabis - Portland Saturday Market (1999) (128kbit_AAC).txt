[SPEAKER_01]: We have a little interview with the other
chief petitioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul and I are both chief petitioners on
the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act, but our other
[SPEAKER_01]: chief petitioner is Dr. Philip Levesque,
a retired professor of pharmacology and
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicology that taught up here at the
current OHSU, also taught at Georgetown
[SPEAKER_01]: University and a number of other
universities around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without any further ado, here's an
interview with Dr. Levesque down at our
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland Saturday Market booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to come down and sign our
petition, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: and today we have one of our chief
petitioners at our booth, Dr. Philip
[SPEAKER_01]: Levesque.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Levesque is a retired professor of
pharmacology and a lobbyist for AARP,
[SPEAKER_01]: the American Association of Retired
Persons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Dr. Levesque.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us why you decided to be a chief
petitioner to regulate the sale of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana to adults and allow doctors to
prescribe it through pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I practice medicine in Malala,
and I found out either directly or
[SPEAKER_00]: indirectly that many of my patients were
not only using my prescriptions for the
[SPEAKER_00]: control of pain, but they were also
smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did an investigation of my own and
found out that marijuana has been used for
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of years and very effectively
for a whole variety of different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you tell us what your credentials
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a PhD in pharmacology and I'm an
osteopathic doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught pharmacology and toxicology for
approximately 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we really thank you again for being
a chief petitioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need people with your types of
credentials to sign on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything you'd like to tell our
television audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign this petition and get this back on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two votes to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make marijuana available for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time that the hypocrisy quit and we
make it available not only for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, but also for recreational
purposes, which it is being used for right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a person who uses it for recreational
purposes and is caught by the police can
[SPEAKER_00]: lose his home, his car, his bank accounts,
any of his assets that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
