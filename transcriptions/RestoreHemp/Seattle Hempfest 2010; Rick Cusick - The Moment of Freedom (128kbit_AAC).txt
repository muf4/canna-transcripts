[SPEAKER_00]: Associate Publisher of High Times
Magazine, the longest-running magazine
[SPEAKER_00]: ever to talk about our freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up to my brother Rick Cusick.
Thank you!
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vivian, my hero!
[SPEAKER_00]: How is everybody today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, how is everybody today?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rick Cusick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the Associate Publisher of High Times
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you!
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one marijuana magazine in the
whole world!
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the people at the 19th annual
Seattle Hempfest, the number one marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: event in the whole world!
[SPEAKER_00]: Soup and a sandwich, baby, right here!
[SPEAKER_00]: The Seattle Hempfest has been going on for
19 years, and the Seattle Hempfest has
[SPEAKER_00]: been protecting our freedom, my freedom,
and your freedom for 19 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my honor to come here every year and
talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I hear about the Seattle Hempfest,
I say to myself, well, what's the Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempfest about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people would say the Seattle Hempfest
is about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people would say the Seattle Hempfest
is about medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people would say the Seattle Hempfest
is about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, the number one food, fuel,
and fiber in the world, preferred by my
[SPEAKER_00]: good friend Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people would say that's what we're
here for today, but you know something?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of the Seattle Hempfest,
that's not the first word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think about medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about those things, but not first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first thing I think about is the
word freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say it with me?
Freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three!
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right!
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the sweetest word in the world,
and that is what the Seattle Hempfest is
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might say, no, no, no, it's about
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might say, no, no, no, it's about
medicine, it's about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to prove it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to prove it to you with numbers
the same way it was proven to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 million Americans, out of 300 million
Americans, 100 million Americans have
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked marijuana at some time in their
lives!
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year in the United States,
25 million Americans smoke it at least
[SPEAKER_00]: once a year!
[SPEAKER_00]: And every month in the United States,
at least 15 million Americans smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: once a month!
[SPEAKER_00]: And 4 million plus Americans smoke
marijuana every single day!
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I to take that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few of you guys out there,
yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single day!
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me tell you another set of
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another set of numbers that gives that
first set of numbers meaning, over 800,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans every year are arrested for
marijuana!
Damn!
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 600,000 Americans every year are
arrested for simple possession!
[SPEAKER_00]: No weight, no selling, just a little
headstand that they want to get high on!
[SPEAKER_00]: 600,000 plus Americans!
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody out there 25 years or under,
under 25 years old?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who out there is under 25 years old?
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I was under 25 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: 400,000 Americans, almost 450,000
Americans every year who are arrested in
[SPEAKER_00]: this country are under 25 years old!
[SPEAKER_00]: Make no mistake, the war against marijuana
is a war against young people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people who are arrested in
this country are under 25 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not by accident, they target
young people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are young, when you are under 25
years old, you have the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: express freedom like you never will again
in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the freedom to explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the freedom to find out the
things you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the freedom to find out the
things you hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're under 25, the world is your
oyster!
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be mine, I'm 56 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking back at, I had spent 39
years of my life smoking marijuana every
[SPEAKER_00]: day!
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am no longer 25 years old and under.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking at the ones right now who
screamed when I said, are you under 25?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking at the ones that the war on
marijuana is waged against!
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am telling you that this moment,
right now in your life, is the moment of
[SPEAKER_00]: your greatest freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the moment when you must express
your demand for your freedom now!
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, you look at these old
eyes, my young friends, I am telling you
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you do it now, if you get off your
ass and you make sure that they legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana now in your life, when there's a
greater moment now than there's ever been,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will never forget it!
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the moment of freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the generation, I'm looking at it!
[SPEAKER_00]: Right out here, I'm looking at it!
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the generation that will legalize
marijuana in your lifetime!
[SPEAKER_00]: My generation dropped that ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: My generation, we thought back in the
1970s, we're gonna have this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized by 1975!
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1979!
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1985!
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: On and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good people my age kept that ball in the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 years they've been doing it here in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, at this moment in time,
at 2010, we have 14 states in this country
[SPEAKER_00]: that have some form of legal marijuana
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 states that have medical marijuana law!
[SPEAKER_00]: We have California this year that is going
to vote on the legalization of marijuana!
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you gotta do is get out and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you gotta do is tell your mother,
tell your father, tell your sister,
[SPEAKER_00]: tell your brother, tell everybody you know
that this is the moment that you must
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That this is the moment you get off your
ass and you do what we didn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honored to be looking at the
generation that is going to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time, you may have a magic word.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the count of three, I want to hear the
word freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three!
Freedom!
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rick Cusick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the Associate Publisher of High Times
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you very much for giving me your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick will be back emceeing here in a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
