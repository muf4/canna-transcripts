[SPEAKER_07]: It is obscene if we have 66 out of
Kentucky's 120 counties that came in
[SPEAKER_08]: before to educate their own children,
and yet the Kentucky public is sending out
[SPEAKER_08]: hundreds of millions of dollars,
and the American public is sending out
[SPEAKER_07]: billions of dollars in tax-free income to
the International Criminal Syndicates in
[SPEAKER_07]: South America and Mexico for a plant my
grandmother used to grow by the thousands
[SPEAKER_07]: of acres, and I'm going to redirect that
money out of the hands of these
[SPEAKER_07]: International Criminal Syndicates,
and I'm going to put them into the capital
[SPEAKER_07]: tax coffers of Frankfurt so I can lift the
people of Kentucky.
I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: going to redirect this money, but I'm
going to redefine the role of government
[SPEAKER_07]: in policing private behavior in the state
of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: We live in a police state.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can leave here, go out and get in your
car, and they can set up a random
[SPEAKER_08]: roadblock in front of you, make you get
out of your car, bring a dog up to sniff
[SPEAKER_08]: you, your car, and all his belongings,
take blood out of the yard, make you pee
[SPEAKER_08]: in a bottle, stick their hands where the
sun don't shine.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a police state.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a police state on the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Jack.
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminds me of another fellow I was
talking about running for governor,
[SPEAKER_07]: and he said, well, I'm before you or
against you, whichever helped you the
[SPEAKER_07]: most.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any government that tells you that the
solution to a present-day problem is
[SPEAKER_07]: doubling the prison population over the
next 20 years has its head stuck where
[SPEAKER_07]: it's never going to discover the thousand
points of light of George Bush.
[SPEAKER_07]: These people's idea of future full
employment is to make half of us prison
[SPEAKER_07]: guards and the other half prisoners.
[SPEAKER_07]: This man is an alien.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not a conservative.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's an alien.
[SPEAKER_07]: He and Ronald Reagan both.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are willing to imprison a whole
generation of people to keep intact the
[SPEAKER_07]: petrochemical and pharmaceutical
monopolies in this country, which he's
[SPEAKER_07]: well-vested in each, and I think he's a
vampire.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think he's an American.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's a vampire willing to suck the
life out of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me take this opportunity right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wherever this gets shown, I am pleased and
honored to be in the presence of one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the most brilliant men in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_08]: This gentleman next to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's an author of Emperor Wears No Clothes
and so much more than just an author.
[SPEAKER_07]: A researcher and a dedicated and diligent
activist and a man who I know for a fact
[SPEAKER_07]: is responsible for tens of thousands of
people in this country being able to come
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the closet and stand up out of the
darkness and stand up out of oppression
[SPEAKER_07]: and despair and lives of quiet desperation
and be able to point to the source of
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge and the truth and the point of
light that this man right here is
[SPEAKER_07]: personally responsible for putting
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not be where I am today were it
not for Jack Hare and I know that a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: people would not be walking tall with
dignity and a sense of pride and a sense
[SPEAKER_07]: that they do no wrong by communicating
with Mother Earth through the herbs and in
[SPEAKER_07]: other fashions and this man right here is
responsible for as much of it as I know
[SPEAKER_07]: of.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure other people deserve credit who
have helped him out but this man right
[SPEAKER_07]: here is one of the most brilliant people
in the United States today and I hope
[SPEAKER_07]: someday that this country and the people
in it will reward him appropriately for
[SPEAKER_07]: what he's done for freedom and
individuality and civil liberties and
[SPEAKER_07]: Mother Earth in this country.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to take that opportunity right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that mean I get free grass for the
rest of my life?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was going to ask you that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me show you something you can take
back and we can give you better photos.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Mr. Henry Ford in 1941 with
Popular Mechanics magazine showing off his
[SPEAKER_09]: car made from hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh is that when the whole car itself was
made from hemp?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says so right there in Popular
Mechanics 1941.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that nice?
[SPEAKER_09]: One more deal in the car.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an ear-rich ivory.
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have never let us find that
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the case of a blind hog
snuffing out an acorn every once in a
[SPEAKER_07]: while.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is dedication and intelligence.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I think Edison said that genius
is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.
[SPEAKER_07]: This man right here has read his ass off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, he certainly has.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you I have a lot of good
teachers.
[SPEAKER_09]: This man wrote a book that I read that was
one of the, really him, Michael Aldridge,
[SPEAKER_09]: had written some of the greatest work on
hemp long before I even really understood
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: He wrote it in 77.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Kentucky, what was it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Marijuana Peasibility Study.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got that in my mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was by adding that and the prospectus.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he is not somebody who needs to come to
me and learn about hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned a lot about hemp from him.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was born in it, Jack.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know marijuana does not make you
crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know marijuana does not lead you to
crime.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know marijuana does not lead you to
harder drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: But marijuana is a system of control that
they can exercise over you because you
[SPEAKER_08]: step out of line from their corporate
policies.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Million Marijuana March and
today there are demonstrations just like
[SPEAKER_07]: this in every major city across the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the laws against marijuana
are the most vivid illustration of where
[SPEAKER_07]: this government has overstepped its bounds
in policing private behavior.
[SPEAKER_07]: The petrochemical pharmaceutical military
industrial complex has utilized the
[SPEAKER_07]: law-making powers of Congress to get
through legislation which has criminalized
[SPEAKER_07]: the farmer who has gone into competition
with these synthetic manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hemp is the number one fiber, the number
one fuel, the number one food and number
[SPEAKER_07]: one medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the laws against marijuana are the most
important step that this government's
[SPEAKER_07]: special interests have put together and
put on the people to remove them from the
[SPEAKER_07]: natural cycle of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: No pot!
[SPEAKER_08]: We smoke pot!
We smoke pot!
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless people actually get out in the
streets and actually demonstrate and
[SPEAKER_07]: actually push the envelope, this First
Amendment has no life.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been at these things when we had 50
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been at them when we had 20,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm always empowered by seeing one
person stand up and try to give life and
[SPEAKER_07]: vibrancy and existence to the Bill of
Rights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bill of Rights in this society.
[SPEAKER_07]: We live in a police state, there's no
doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can lead this demonstration and go get
in your car and get out on the road.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they can set up a random roadblock in
front of you and make you get out of your
[SPEAKER_07]: car, bring up a dog to sniff you,
your car and all its belongings,
[SPEAKER_07]: take blood out of your arm, make you pee
in a bottle if they think you got
[SPEAKER_07]: something.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a police state!
[SPEAKER_08]: I will not live in a police state.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our fathers and our grandfathers did not
fight and die on the beaches of Normandy
[SPEAKER_08]: and Iwo Jima so that you would have to pee
in a cup to hold a job in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a peaceful solution called the
Peace Revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a war and we're in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we can win it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a dream, so believe it and get
ready to receive it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the war is over and we've won it,
let's remember how we done it so we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a peaceful solution called the
Peace Revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think marijuana was a problem back
in 1937.
[SPEAKER_07]: It certainly wasn't a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's certainly not a problem today and
it's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know how it could possibly have
been a problem in 1937.
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for the fact that when they passed
that law for the first time the federal
[SPEAKER_07]: government took over the right to tell you
what seed you could plant in the ground
[SPEAKER_07]: and what you could do with the product of
that seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then put it like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people who don't know me give me a
reputation for going to legalize drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not want to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the business of trying to license
and regulate cannabis as a crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomatoes are legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alcohol and tobacco is licensed and
regulated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seeked to license and regulate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it out of the black market status,
just cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would take the law enforcement dollar
which we would save off of that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: currently spending on detecting,
arresting, prosecuting and incarcerating
[SPEAKER_07]: people who associate with the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we change the laws we'd save all that
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would go after the hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd go after the synthetic drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: The crack, the cocaine, the heroin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those kinds of synthetic drugs,
man-made drugs which destroy the spirit
[SPEAKER_07]: and overcome rights of determination and
self-choice because they're addictive and
[SPEAKER_07]: destructive to the body.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the most insidious is the prescription
medicine scourge.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are pharmaceutical medicines that
have an impact on society and paralyze the
[SPEAKER_07]: entire portions of Kentucky including vast
regions of eastern Kentucky which have no
[SPEAKER_07]: economy and have no jobs and are the main
sources for illicit Oxycontin and Orset
[SPEAKER_07]: and Lortel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these pharmaceutical companies are out
there spending billions of dollars
[SPEAKER_07]: encouraging as many people as they can to
take this poison.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they know that it is addictive and
they know there's a huge black market that
[SPEAKER_07]: builds up around people's necessity of
continuing to take this addictive medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: when their doctor stops their treatment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a big black market up there
and the pharmaceutical companies are well
[SPEAKER_07]: aware of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For less than a penny a tablet they could
create Oxycontin so you can't crush it up
[SPEAKER_07]: and snort it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're aware of this and that they
didn't do that and it's not because they
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't want to save a penny a tablet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's simply because they knew they had a
big addiction situation and they were
[SPEAKER_07]: going to have a lot more Oxycontin if
everybody was addicted to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the question of him the question of
cannabis is the most vivid illustration of
[SPEAKER_07]: how this government has overstepped its
bounds in policing the private behavior of
[SPEAKER_07]: citizens.
[SPEAKER_07]: When they told us we couldn't plant a head
seed in the ground they severed us from
[SPEAKER_07]: the natural cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is what they seek to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I call it the synthetic subversion where
they want to replace all the natural
[SPEAKER_07]: products on earth that used to be grown
out of God's earth and God's seed and
[SPEAKER_07]: replace them with synthetic products and
knocked our farmer out of the agrarian
[SPEAKER_07]: society and the agrarian market and made
the ghost towns of our small cities and
[SPEAKER_07]: villages across this country.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to rediscover a cash crop one that
will allow our farmers to go back to the
[SPEAKER_07]: land.
[SPEAKER_07]: One that will allow our farmers to compete
with the petrochemical pipelines.
[SPEAKER_07]: You plant U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 percent agricultural land in it you
would have to import another drop of oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can replace the spills in the Gulf.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can replace the environmental
catastrophe that petroleum pipelines have
[SPEAKER_07]: cast upon another earth and instead let
our farmers grow hemp as a fuel crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1991 Willie Nelson and I poured hip oil
into my Mercedes diesel and drove it
[SPEAKER_07]: across Kentucky in my bid for governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why he started his biofuel plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen folks you all have been handed a
torch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack Herod bless his soul passed away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting old up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know we cannot make this ball much
longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to become educated.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to learn the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to reach out there and grab the
responsibility of maintaining your
[SPEAKER_07]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every generation must re-win its own
freedoms and those very sacrifices right
[SPEAKER_07]: up to the very last second I've been
talking to you made on your behalf cannot
[SPEAKER_07]: continue anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: What really counts is your own commitment
to what sacrifices you're willing to make
[SPEAKER_07]: in the future to maintain your freedom.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is right there in front of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage you to learn the law.
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage you to learn the political
process.
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage you to reach out there and
take responsibility your own freedom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Live your life like a warrior.
[SPEAKER_07]: God bless you all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for having me out here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey this is Willie and you're gonna be
voting for a governor in your state
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about Gatewood Galbraith because
he's my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known him a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and I believe the same way about a
whole lot of things and I think you
[SPEAKER_02]: believe a lot of the same things that he
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hear him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gatewood for governor.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Gatewood and I was very impressed by
him you know we both loved cannabis and we
[SPEAKER_00]: would smoke out at the normal conferences
together for a few years but in 1990 not
[SPEAKER_00]: September he called me and said Willie
Nelson wants to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hung out with Willie and we got him
some herb and he would have me roll joints
[SPEAKER_00]: about every 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd say roll another one Paul roll
another one Paul and so I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he invited me to come back to
Kentucky in October that this guy Gatewood
[SPEAKER_00]: Galbraith was running for governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I flew back to Lexington Kentucky and
had a press conference there with Willie
[SPEAKER_00]: Nelson and Gatewood Galbraith and then
they drove Gatewood's red Mercedes Benz
[SPEAKER_00]: station wagon powered entirely on hemp
seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took pressed hemp seed oil discovered
that it can be used as a diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They poured it right into the engine and
were able to drive from Lexington about 50
[SPEAKER_00]: miles to the state capitol in Frankfurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stopped at the state capitol the
Kentucky legislators went crazy over
[SPEAKER_00]: Willie Nelson and we drove on about
another 80 miles on to Louisville Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: and Willie Nelson did a benefit that night
in Louisville Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd always heard that Rudolph Diesel had
manufactured his diesel engine run off
[SPEAKER_07]: seed oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We really didn't understand quite grasp
that this was in the early 90s or late 80s
[SPEAKER_07]: and then a fellow from Nevada,
Las Vegas, Nevada came through town
[SPEAKER_07]: driving a little Volkswagen diesel and he
was running it off Burger King oil and so
[SPEAKER_07]: we had just derived some hemp oil out of
hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hemp seeds are 30 to 40 percent oil by
weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got 100 pounds of hemp seeds you can
drive 30 to 40 pounds of pure oil out of
[SPEAKER_07]: it and so we had some of that and he
tested it out in his engine and he said
[SPEAKER_07]: this is the best seed oil that I've ever
driven this car on and so we had seed oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: When Willie came in to do a benefit
concert for me we poured that hemp oil
[SPEAKER_07]: into my Mercedes diesel and drove it about
110 miles across Kentucky and it was the
[SPEAKER_07]: first time in I guess 50 to 60 years that
any vehicle had ever been driven on hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: oil on the United States roads but Willie
told me later on 12 years later actually
[SPEAKER_07]: no I mean about 10 years later he says
Gatewood he says that afternoon we did
[SPEAKER_07]: that and it taught me what it was all
about and that's the reason I started my
[SPEAKER_07]: biofuel company was from what we learned
that afternoon driving your Mercedes
[SPEAKER_07]: across there and we also smoking about the
biggest hood or probably road in Kentucky
[SPEAKER_07]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a caravan of us we went from
the Hyatt there and Rupp Auditorium
[SPEAKER_00]: through Frankfurt the state capital which
is about 80 miles and then altogether 120
[SPEAKER_00]: miles all the way into Louisville which is
the largest city in Kentucky and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: did a big benefit concert for you there
that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know we need we need help in health
care hemp as a cash crop out there for the
[SPEAKER_07]: petroleum purposes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now hemp you get 22 barrels of petroleum
off an acre of hemp when you grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: in an industrial textile direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our farmers need that niche in the energy
market and that would furnish according to
[SPEAKER_07]: the state calculation 68,000 new jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: For seed, hemp is planted in hills like
corn sometimes by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is a dioecious plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The female flower is inconspicuous but the
male flower is easily spotted.
[SPEAKER_01]: In seed production after the pollen has
been shed these male plants are cut out.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the seeds on a female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp for fiber is ready to harvest when
the pollen is shedding and the leaves are
[SPEAKER_01]: falling.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kentucky hemp harvest comes in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here the old standby has been the self
rake reaper which has been used for a
[SPEAKER_01]: generation or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp grows so luxuriantly in Kentucky that
harvesting is sometimes difficult which
[SPEAKER_01]: may account for the popularity of the self
rake with its lateral stroke.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kentucky hemp is shocked as soon as
safe after cutting to be spread out for
[SPEAKER_01]: retting later in the fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so heartening to see the progress
that you know of course Proposition 215 in
[SPEAKER_07]: California in 96 and what you folks have
done here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it's just it's just fuel for my
fire to see you all actually succeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something I've been trying to do in
Kentucky for many you know for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to lift Kentucky out of poverty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the most poverty ridden states
in the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: We find 47, 48, 49, 50 and all the
standard living indexes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our children are poor.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're broke.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't fund the retirement for our
teachers or for our public employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to find rediscover something that
will generate some money in the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course we were the world's largest
producer of cannabis for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you know I want to go back and
touch on the history and heritage of the
[SPEAKER_07]: state and get us to return to cannabis as
a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey we're the first state east of
Mississippi to actually license and
[SPEAKER_07]: regulate the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will lift Kentucky out of poverty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll fill every hotel room and motel room
in the state seven nights out of seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make tourism boom won't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: These won't be people come in there and
drink whiskey and punch holes in your
[SPEAKER_07]: walls.
[SPEAKER_07]: These people come in sit down row one and
order room service.
[SPEAKER_07]: The United States Constitution does not
provide you the right to life,
[SPEAKER_07]: liberty and pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an independence declaration of
independence.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not law.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't officially have a right to
that under federal law.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Kentucky has a constitution also just
like all the other states do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it just so happens that Kentucky's
constitution is the most pro people
[SPEAKER_07]: constitution ever written.
[SPEAKER_07]: That our people back in 1890 got so tired
of being raped by the railroad companies
[SPEAKER_07]: that they wrote a constitution that
protected the people and kept corporations
[SPEAKER_07]: from being running roughshod over
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even now that's beginning to fracture
as our legislature keeps sounding out to
[SPEAKER_07]: the folks that I call the petrochemical
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_07]: transnational, corporate fascist elite son
of a bitches.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's gonna happen is that the very
first section of Kentucky's constitution
[SPEAKER_07]: ensures that its citizens constitutionally
are endowed with the right to life,
[SPEAKER_07]: liberty and pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the number one section in Kentucky
constitution.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel obliged to make it the number
one basis of policy for my relationship of
[SPEAKER_07]: government to the people and state of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna get it off of their backs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna take it out of the bedrooms and
the bloodstreams and the brains and the
[SPEAKER_07]: bladders and the billfolds and back
pockets and the internet bulletin boards
[SPEAKER_07]: and put them back in a little box where
they belong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna make government not a burden on
the people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the role of government to
uplift enlighten, educate and endow people
[SPEAKER_07]: with an appreciation of life, appreciation
of the social compact, their civil duties,
[SPEAKER_07]: their civil responsibilities and make sure
that we address them as sovereign human
[SPEAKER_07]: beings capable of making their own
decisions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're gonna get medical marijuana in
the hands of every sick and dying person
[SPEAKER_07]: in the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: No permit needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna take it out of the hands of the
10 and 13 and 14 year olds who are doing
[SPEAKER_07]: it just for kicks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna give them over to the old age
homes, to all the old folks in the old age
[SPEAKER_07]: homes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, increase the appetite, put a smile on
their face and think about the increased
[SPEAKER_07]: visitation by the young folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's go see dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, folks, here we are standing on the
corner of a man of war and for sales road.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Keeneland time.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of traffic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's gonna be a large amount of
traffic coming through this intersection.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a sign here that I'm holding up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can fix a sign of your own.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd like you to get a sign from us,
but if we can't get you one, make your own
[SPEAKER_07]: sign.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure it says gatewood governor
independent.
[SPEAKER_07]: You stand on a corner, you get traffic
coming one way with the light changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You turn around and you get traffic going
the other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just as many people as you can see
that image, gatewood governor independent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been out on the corners like this for
about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ran for Commissioner of Agriculture in
83.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started doing it at that time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been, what, 28 years?
[SPEAKER_06]: Step up its way a little bit here and
let's give you folks a little walk.
Okay,
folks, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So believe it and get ready to receive it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's take back America.
[SPEAKER_03]: The war is over and we want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's remember how we done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an independent candidate for governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want a political party.
[SPEAKER_07]: My running mate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, hey, dear, if you're gonna use your
outside voice, go over and join the other
[SPEAKER_07]: children over on the playground.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to get some serious
conversation going on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you go over with the other kids
over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people say, Galbraith,
you're a perennial candidate.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Kentucky's got perennial
problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the people would beat me the first time
and solve the problems, I wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_07]: had to run again.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they didn't and they haven't and they
can't because neither party can produce a
[SPEAKER_07]: candidate that can disengage from the
partisanship long enough to work with the
[SPEAKER_07]: other side to actually get the job done.
[SPEAKER_07]: The leadership of both parties have their
horns locked up like two white tailed buck
[SPEAKER_07]: fighting over territory while our business
lays dead in the dust.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and both of the parties are to blame
for what we've got here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither party has presented any solutions
to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: D and I are not asking you to vote against
your party or vote for the other dreaded
[SPEAKER_07]: party.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're asking you to vote for an
independent governor who does not care who
[SPEAKER_07]: gets credit for doing what's right for the
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a Democrat or Republican or an
independent, if you've got a solution to
[SPEAKER_07]: Kentucky's problems, you can come to the
governor's office where we stand and we
[SPEAKER_07]: will do our best and we will give you all
the credit for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you come up with a good idea,
Mr. Williams had a great idea the other
[SPEAKER_07]: day and I complimented him on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, David, I said, when I'm
governor and you're president of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Senate, we're gonna put that idea through.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, folks, I've got to tell you,
Mr. Williams can't win this election.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Williams cannot win this election.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, listen, if it wasn't for an
extremely good mama and the credit of any
[SPEAKER_07]: bill, maximum security prison,
I'd gone wrong for a really long time ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my mama probably get me on straight and
narrow more than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I as I got older, I became
desperate for a role model and so I looked
[SPEAKER_07]: for the people who I thought stood for the
right things.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're hard to find.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I decided, quite frankly, if you want
to know the truth, I decided to just
[SPEAKER_07]: decide to be the new hero and there's no
reason in the world why I shouldn't be it,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
So I decided to be the new hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gatewood supported our initiative drive,
did so very publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be very happy to see the turn of
events since then, but he was an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker and one of my mentors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We watched him run nine races in 29 years
at every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the most efficient vote-getting
process in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was classic Gatewood.
[SPEAKER_05]: He ran for Congress back-to-back in 2000.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2002, he said he was done after the
2002 election.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there he was the next year,
running for Attorney General.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, I was drafted into this race.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gatewood was a soundbite machine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get your friends out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget that early May day I
spent with him in 2007 while he was
[SPEAKER_05]: running in the Democratic primary for
governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, dear.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you all, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: A street corner charmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kentucky's gonna be a fun place to live
when I'm governor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who raised Kentucky's conscience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we cannot have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the partisanship that's killing us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Engaging and intelligent, but also...
[SPEAKER_05]: Right here, in my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wacky enough... to never be taken
seriously by the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the time he was arrested during
Lexington's Fourth of July parade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he was an independent cuss.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Gatewood... Put this head down this
way, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kentucky will miss you.
We'll be right back.
