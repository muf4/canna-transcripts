[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul Stanford came up here from Oregon,
and he is with the Hemp and Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Foundation, the THC Foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the event sponsor of HempFest
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC Foundation presents Seattle
HempFest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also the author and chief petitioner
of the Tax and Regulate bill in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give a warm Seattle welcome to Paul
Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vivian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most inspirational speaker in hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Seattle HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have helped, in our clinics,
almost 100,000 people get a legal medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you out there have got one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hands if you've got a legal
medical marijuana permit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one of those conditions,
hey, give us a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have doctors who can help you all
across this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to see more and more patients
become legal, especially if they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's not the end all and
be all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing I would like better than
to see our medical clinics become kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a side issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see complete legal marijuana
for every adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see us all able to grow our own
crop where we don't have to go down and
[SPEAKER_00]: get a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a God given right to be able to
grow the plant that produces more fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: more protein, more oil than any other
plant on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working to do that through our
political committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find out more about it,
go to Hemp.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's H-E-M-P dot org.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an initiative petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pushing in Oregon for 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: To end adult marijuana prohibition and
restore industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get it on the ballot and win the
election, which is a hard one,
[SPEAKER_00]: then marijuana be legal January 1st,
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a year and a half from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Berlin Wall fell very,
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can end marijuana
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been waiting a couple generations to
see some progress on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, it's moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to Hemp.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get involved in the movement to end adult
marijuana prohibition and stop putting
[SPEAKER_00]: honest Americans in prison for supporting
a plant that can save the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And restore hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dee Paul Stanford from the Hemp and
Cannabis Foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle Hemp Fest event sponsor this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
