[SPEAKER_01]: This is the next joint right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's normally what I refer to as the
overdrive part of the set.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a track off that Honest
Racket album featuring the grouch and the
[SPEAKER_01]: living legend, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feel free to hit, you know what I'm
saying, a little bit, a little bit looser
[SPEAKER_01]: than all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit gets me checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This life we've heard we grow,
we gone ahead.
I'm not an artist, dawg.
I write random verses.
Sit back and laugh cause the world gets
worse and it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't have taken a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to let that Honest Racket penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest in the stage, in the state,
roll like the interstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit the road on the grind, only ride in
motor k's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were made to lay the foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't coming out of pocket like
Copenhagen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of the snow bunnies swinging
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vince Vaughn saying I'm so money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny cause I'm a swinger too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pumped past till I see the plum truck
gas chugging a blast like this drink's for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cheap tipper, bartender,
I ain't but I ain't bout to leave with her
[SPEAKER_00]: unless she makes my drink stiffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No ice, no back, just my ease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This life we've heard we grow,
we gone ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your name is no joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trapped in the box, but we're
reaching for the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tearing down the walls, looking for the
reason that we build.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build cause it's the only way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say peace ain't more than a road to pain.
We're trapped in the box, but we're
reaching for the ceiling.
Tearing down
[SPEAKER_00]: the walls so I can switch things around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're listening, you want that
best thing in town, do whatever your wrist
[SPEAKER_00]: please.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that hot blistering style.
[SPEAKER_00]: This life we've heard we grow,
we gone ahead.
Your name is no joke.
We're trapped in the box, but we're
reaching for the ceiling.
Tearing down the walls, looking for the
reason that we build.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build cause it's the only way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say peace ain't more than a road to pain.
We're trapped in the box, but we're
reaching for the ceiling.
Tearing down the walls
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can switch things around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's reciprocated, both ways,
hip stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: NEP St. John's, hip stop.
NEP St. John's, hip stop.
