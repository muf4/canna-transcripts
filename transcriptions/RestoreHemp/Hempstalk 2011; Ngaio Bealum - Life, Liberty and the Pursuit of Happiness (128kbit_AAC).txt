[SPEAKER_00]: Make some noise if you like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about if you like marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it used to be legal till 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: The founding fathers, Jefferson,
Washington, all those guys, they grew it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Declaration of Independence was
originally written on hemp paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Better paper than trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better fabric than cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can smoke it and talk about shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why John Hancock's signature is so
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was high as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be high to fly a kite in a
thunderstorm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Franklin smoked a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The national bird is the bald eagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What bird did Ben Franklin want for the
national bird?
[SPEAKER_00]: The turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, the eagle flies graceful,
free, and majestic above the clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you can eat a turkey,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's John Hancock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, I'll sign for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana makes you a better cook anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a good cook because I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will invent shit to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we got Bisquick and peanut butter,
we got peanut butter rolls coming in 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked in the pantry one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had marshmallows, margarine,
and top ramen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making ramen treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ramen treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hella good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use the flavor packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll eff it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not savory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys know what top ramen is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an upscale crowd one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said top ramen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just stared at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, y'all know a couple of
noodles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't afford a freaking cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to get old noodles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever been so poor you went through
your couch again?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a couch, I'd go through my
friends' couches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just invite myself over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steal money off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work's stoned, not hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I always say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke a lot of weed, if marijuana
is no longer a hobby, if it has become a
[SPEAKER_00]: life style, you have to take steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be proactive like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's time to renew my driver's
license picture, I get high as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull into the parking lot of the DMV,
and I hot box the shit out of my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go take my picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want them to think that I look
like that all the goddamn time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they pull me over, what seems to
be the trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
