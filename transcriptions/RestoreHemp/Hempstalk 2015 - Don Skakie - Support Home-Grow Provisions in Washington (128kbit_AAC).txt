[SPEAKER_00]: We have no homegrown Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, anybody 21 and up can have the
four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's re-legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you can grow it and give it away,
that's re-legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm still in Washington State
forced to go to a store that has any of
[SPEAKER_00]: 271 pesticides on it, which is where
they're trying to drive all the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, that's not re-legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our movement has come up quite a
way, and we made a lot of ground with
[SPEAKER_00]: medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems now that it's recreational
legal and everybody sees a big pot of
[SPEAKER_00]: gold, that medical seems to be taking a
back seat, seems to be getting a rougher
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, seems to be not legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank goodness for the Oregon
program that is so well in response in
[SPEAKER_00]: your society here that it is still a part,
as a matter of fact, it leads
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to go to the medical shop
right now until we can get our other
[SPEAKER_00]: people licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington did that exactly the opposite
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave the licenses out to the rec
people, people that were medical were not
[SPEAKER_00]: as accepted and left down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now they are trying to shut us
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at a place called Northwest
Cannabis Market up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a place where 20 to 30 vendors,
seven days a week, put our medicine in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of legitimate patients with cards
across our two markets in Seattle and
[SPEAKER_00]: White Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just on the 15th of September shut down
our Seattle market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had 2.5 million patient visits to
our market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do they want to serve our needs?
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to eliminate your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to shove you into the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to tax you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about what's best for you,
or what's best for the people,
[SPEAKER_00]: or best for the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a money and a power grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say to all of you in any other
state, Ohio, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget the people that got us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our growers, our experts, they know what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this new crowd, they're going to
do great because they got lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: money behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want a legalized pot at $40
and $50 a gram tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a legalized pot so it goes down to
two bucks a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow my 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give some to you and to you
and to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you something, when anybody
can grow in Washington state, that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: the best protection for any patient
because they will not only not be forced
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to a store where poison is not
medicine, they will be able to get their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from anyone they choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be your coworker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I say to you again, until you can grow
your own and give it away for free to any
[SPEAKER_00]: other adult without tax, fee, license,
permit, registration, or announcement,
[SPEAKER_00]: now the new thing is they want to come in
and have a liquor board inspect your
[SPEAKER_00]: medical grow, the weed that you grow
privately for yourself, for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to come in your home and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I say get the hell out of my house
and get the hell out of my cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: get the hell out of my baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real legalization is a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what we've done in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I praise what you've done in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward, I mean, everybody up
there is either going underground or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're leaving the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of great Washington
growers down here in Oregon now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the public can only benefit
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be active.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in Washington, get on the
phone, get on your email, get in your
[SPEAKER_00]: legislators face and say, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to grab every freaking
dollar from the people that can least
[SPEAKER_00]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need real legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
Thank you.
