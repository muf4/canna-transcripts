[SPEAKER_02]: The book's credibility got a boost from
Jack's discovery of this 14-minute
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary, supposedly made by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: government five years after the Marijuana
Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its purpose was to encourage farmers to
grow outlawed hemp during World War II.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long ago, when these ancient Grecian
temples were new, hemp was already old in
[SPEAKER_01]: the service of mankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: For thousands of years even then,
this plant had been grown for cordage and
[SPEAKER_01]: coarse cloth in China and elsewhere in the
East.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, with Philippine and East Indian
sources of hemp in the hands of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese and shipment of jute from India
curtailed, American hemp must meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: needs of our Army and Navy as well as of
our industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1942, patriotic farmers, at the
government's request, planted 36,000 acres
[SPEAKER_01]: of seed hemp, an increase of several
thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal for 1943 is 50,000 acres of seed
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: For to grow hemp legally, you must have a
federal registration and tax stamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is provided for in your contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask your AAA committee man or your county
agent about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack often staged public showings of Hemp
for Victory to validate his history of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also used the film as an example of
government deception and hypocrisy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was stunned one day in 1988 to get
a call from a newspaper reporter,
[SPEAKER_02]: questioning the authenticity of the film.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mr. Herr, we went out to check the
information and we found nobody that would
[SPEAKER_00]: corroborate your story that this movie was
even ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said this movie was made by the United
States government, this movie Hemp for
[SPEAKER_00]: Victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if there would be any evidence that
the government ever made such a film,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be in the Library of Congress,
it would be in the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture, it is in neither place.
[SPEAKER_02]: His reputation on the line, Jack and his
friends went on an excursion to
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just determined to find the
documentation that made it a credible
[SPEAKER_03]: government movie made by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: government and not made by Jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't see it as detective work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just saw it as we were on a mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on a mission from God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many others before Jack had searched the
Library of Congress for proof of the
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary's existence and found none.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a day of digging, Jack ran into the
same lack of evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: After deciding to give up, we decided to
give it one more try.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a dusty old book hidden among clutter
in a back room, they found it,
[SPEAKER_02]: the official Library of Congress
documentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed, the film had been made by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp for Victory.
Hemp for Victory.
