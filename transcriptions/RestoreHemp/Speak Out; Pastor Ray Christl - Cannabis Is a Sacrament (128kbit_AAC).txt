[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Pastor Ray Crystal and I'm an
assistant associate pastor with the
[SPEAKER_00]: religion of Jesus Church here in Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have branches throughout the Hawaiian
Islands and we'd like to wish you a happy
[SPEAKER_00]: Easter and may the love of Jesus Christ be
in your heart and we just really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pray for Hawaiian Islands and the problems
we have associated with drug use and
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many years here in Maui, I have been
the facilitator for people with education
[SPEAKER_00]: about medical cannabis for the sick and
dying and elderly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last Friday evening, a week ago,
I was on the dialogue show on Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: Public Television, which I'd like to show
a tape of on this cable network and I
[SPEAKER_00]: debated the doctor in substance abuse and
also the DEA officer and Major Tano of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii Honolulu Vice Commander and we got
into a good discussion, a loving
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion about how we could problem
solve and the police admitted that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want people going to jail anymore
for use, that those people have become
[SPEAKER_00]: victimized by drugs in our society and we
moved the discussion, we evolved it along
[SPEAKER_00]: to where we decided that, and the
president has decided this, that medically
[SPEAKER_00]: we are going to deal with the problem more
than as a criminal justice incarceration
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people need to start taking the fear
out of their lives about using and people
[SPEAKER_00]: they see using drugs and we have to start
using the church and the medical community
[SPEAKER_00]: to solve problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in Maui County and you are in
need of education about medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to call my office and there is
a defense that was mentioned in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's penal code, this is Hawaii Penal
Code, for 20 years it's been buried in the
[SPEAKER_00]: penal code and it's 712-1240-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a defense to promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it basically boils down to is if
you're a medical need and your doctor will
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe medicine of marijuana for you,
that as a practitioner, as a religious
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioner and a pastor in a church,
we have a defense, me as a facilitator in
[SPEAKER_00]: education to teach you how to grow it in
your house and you as the, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: right to your life and liberty and the
pursuit of happiness and to heal yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our basic, most human right we have
and so there's a defense in the law and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the state law and we will help you
in every way possible on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly, there's books that I would
like you to be cognizant of and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we always like to talk about is that
in the United States every year from
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco which is a very addictive
substance and causes devastation of three
[SPEAKER_00]: to four hundred thousand deaths,
alcohol is devastating and we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus made the wine at the wedding feast
and made drugs as his first miracle and so
[SPEAKER_00]: we are free to pursue intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, marijuana has never caused a single
death in the history of the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I debated on the dialogue and they can't
come up with a person yet that'll say that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been death or that there's a
lethal dose to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're trying to do is put on an
armor of like a police officer puts on
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're going in and they're raiding
someone and they're putting on all this
[SPEAKER_00]: body armor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could put on the body armor of the law
and the law has stated religious use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ninth Appellate Court has ruled this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police have been cognizant of it for
six months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not about to advertise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to hype it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're saying is our church and our
sacrament is religiously legal now under
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ninth Appellate Court and the Freedom
Restoration Act for religion signed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: president in 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also been a directive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an executive order by the president
that says industrial hemp, industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: is a strategic food and resource for fiber
which you can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clothing, canvas, paper and also that
cellulose can be used to make the new
[SPEAKER_00]: substance in 1936 that DuPont wanted to
just be made out of coal or out of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the same product of cellulose
in the stock of the Sensemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, we could be growing
medical marijuana and take the stock of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and make plastic to build homes for
Hawaiians at very inexpensive rates or we
[SPEAKER_00]: could build an automobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show you a picture real quickly
here on page 50 of a car that Henry Ford
[SPEAKER_00]: made out of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hard for people to believe it
but here's a car made out of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: not only did Henry Ford want the car to be
made out of plastic made from hemp but he
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted it to be run.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a process where you could renew
and globally take plants, especially hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and after you take the seeds off for the
food to feed starving people or to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: animals or to press that oil into the
lubricating lubricants for the grease and
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally we can use plants,
natural resources given to us by God,
[SPEAKER_00]: our creator to solve problems here in
Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the National Review which is the
publication of the conservative right and
[SPEAKER_00]: William F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckley who is a scholar has come out
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second front page in a year
where he said, yeah, it's power people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the war on drugs really lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gives 17 scholarly points in this
magazine where he feels that the way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: is harm reduction and immediate relaxation
of laws against cannabis for even
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal as a church is to convince the
state Supreme Court, our legislature,
[SPEAKER_00]: our governor, our mayor, our county
council that cannabis must remain in one's
[SPEAKER_00]: home in the beginning until further
studies are done on how Holland has solved
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem of differentiating hard drug
use from soft drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Holland you can go into, oh,
there's over a thousand different,
[SPEAKER_00]: they euphemistically use the term coffee
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these are marijuana hashish
clubs where you go in and you smoke either
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish which is the resins that are
collected by literally in ancient times in
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd have the women, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be more, you know, or the
slaves would do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that were not the princes and
the religious leaders, they were the
[SPEAKER_00]: recipients of the hash oil which is called
charus in India which is sacred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would rub the plant and then this
black gooey tar would be rubbed into
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepalese temple balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was for the shaman, the top
shamans, the priestly class, the Brahmin
[SPEAKER_00]: class, the sadhus in India that walk
around almost butt naked in India smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as a religious sacrament.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they went to Jamaica and started
preaching to the black slaves who also had
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant from Africa in their religions
and from the triangulation from the south
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Zulus and what we know as South
Africa all the way up to the Moroccan Keef
[SPEAKER_00]: and across to the shamans in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we get the word therapeutics from
the ancient shamans of Egypt, cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: been used for religion and medicine since
the beginning of time, immemorial,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12,000 year history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here now with the new machinery that
we can take and make plastic and build
[SPEAKER_00]: homes and make furniture, make
automobiles, run automobiles on one single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant let alone if we started to realize
the potential of other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See when a plant is useful they give it a
Latin word by the name of sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis sativa means cultivated for
usefulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what cannabis sativa means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for them to try to eradicate a plant
where they have laws against extinction,
[SPEAKER_00]: in other words if there's some obscure
plant like this tree here that was being
[SPEAKER_00]: eradicated, it's against the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of a sudden they can fly
helicopters to go after a plant that most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people of the world in religion has
said has been a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be made into plastic and
paper so that we don't have to cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can feed starving people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can give medicine to people to
alleviate their suffering because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cure diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It alleviates suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an analgesic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a comforter like the Holy Spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes on us when we need it and we pray
and the Lord is with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the time of Jesus it was very
common for Jewish women in childbirth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact they found a number of bodies
where the women they didn't have cesarean
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess in those days or wasn't perfected
yet and the women died in childbirth and
[SPEAKER_00]: they found chunks of hashish in their
stomach and they went oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time now we know in the last few
years because of Ronald Reagan saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana kills brain cells just like
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did a study on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got them to back it up and they did a
study and what did the doctors the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists find.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said well we found that there's
receptor sites in the brain and we think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a marijuana drug in the brain that
we didn't know existed because we found
[SPEAKER_00]: these receptor sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a person smokes marijuana it gets
in the blood it flushes over these
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor sites that are there for some
reason and the person gets high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the person when the when the
receptor sites are maxed out they start to
[SPEAKER_00]: shut down so that the person starts to not
get any higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only get so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't overdose on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't kill yourself and you can't get
any higher than what you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you abuse it and the more
you're compulsive and the more you are
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic smoking or of cannabis the more
you're just hurting yourself because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can only what the key is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use it somewhat in ritual and
you're in your spiritual life and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible you'd use it occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need it when you come home from
work at a hard day's work and you need the
[SPEAKER_00]: relief and the stress reduction of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big killer in our society of
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this book here let me just show you
that for 100 years in American history
[SPEAKER_00]: babies infants were given the strongest
tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words this hash oil that I was
talking about the charus the resin was
[SPEAKER_00]: made into a liquid and it was given to
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our constitution made out of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this constitution stands for anything
it stands for my right to say the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our church stands for truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can be out debated and what we're
against is lies about cannabis and lying
[SPEAKER_00]: to the children.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you allow us to talk to the children I
feel we can do everything to postpone
[SPEAKER_00]: their usage prematurely until if they are
so precocious because all the music from
[SPEAKER_00]: rock and roll and jazz on up to their hip
hop and reggae has pushed them to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui Waui the thing that this island is
most famous for in this community and
[SPEAKER_00]: these islands are most famous for is
pushed into a forbidden fruit situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us and help yourself and help your
pastors and let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please have me over at your church or at
your civic group to talk about this and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's dialogue on this like that award
winning show that I was on last Friday and
[SPEAKER_00]: help public broadcasting help this station
because we don't get the opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: common people to come on the air to speak
too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pushed away from the media and
that's a problem in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the wonderful Aloha from our church
to you for this Easter season and let us
[SPEAKER_00]: love each other and create a brotherhood
and a sisterhood here in the Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: islands that can be a beacon to the world
and we'll bring millions of people to
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii to share the Aloha and the Aina.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aloha.
Aloha.
