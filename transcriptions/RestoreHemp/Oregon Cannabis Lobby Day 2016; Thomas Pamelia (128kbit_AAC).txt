[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings, everyone, and thank you for
coming out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather, I think, is a sign that we're
divinely supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although we're few in number here,
there will be thousands of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: will watch these recordings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will go out all over the United
States to support the future medical
[SPEAKER_00]: programs that are sure to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Thomas Pamelia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a citizen journalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a writer and a patient advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The altruistic strain hunters in the 710
speak easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to begin my remarks with
three quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These quotes have a common theme,
and this theme is central to our mission
[SPEAKER_00]: in being here today to speak to our state
representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: These quotes come from history,
and it is history that we must observe and
[SPEAKER_00]: be students of, or we risk to lose
everything, including the great body of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge we've evolved as a species to
create.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are one, our suffering is shared,
and the people behind these quotes are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get us to realize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting
a harder battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather make mistakes in kindness
and compassion than work miracles in
[SPEAKER_00]: unkindness and hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother Teresa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want others to be happy,
practice compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be happy, practice
compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was said by the Dalai Lama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassion is a facet of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect is a facet of acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acceptance is needed to live in a
pluralistic society where individual
[SPEAKER_00]: choices are respected, assuming they do
not infringe on others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassion is what is missing from this
trajectory of onerous regulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: overreaching bureaucracy being enacted on
the backs of the sick and most
[SPEAKER_00]: impoverished.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been backed into a corner and
can't help but rally here and bring our
[SPEAKER_00]: hearts and voices into a unified chorus
that allows our adversity to be observed
[SPEAKER_00]: and our opinions to be acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who voted for Proposition
91, we would like it enacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we voted for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who did not vote for Proposition
91, I'm sure you also would like the rule
[SPEAKER_00]: of law upheld.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cannabis is created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All humans are created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot be divisive and expect to
exemplify compassion as individuals or as
[SPEAKER_00]: a collective culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a single human can tell the difference
between medical and recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and is our internal physiological receptor
system that guarantees our right to this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and its inherent safety and non
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a single human has been harmed
directly by cannabis in the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: humankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us remember now to be students of
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a vacuum of leadership within our
OMMP program.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a vacuum of compassion and a
vacuum of usefulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patient dissatisfaction and
disenfranchisement is at an all time high
[SPEAKER_00]: and this leads to the grand question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where exactly is the patient advocacy and
leadership within our state program?
[SPEAKER_00]: For this reason, I would like to work with
OHA to draft a patient bill of rights that
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantees a fundamental access and
respect for individuals enrolled in our
[SPEAKER_00]: state OMMP program.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this reason, I would like to work with
the OHA leadership to create a diplomatic
[SPEAKER_00]: patient group who can take up roles to
collaborate with the program
[SPEAKER_00]: administrators and the employees to help
usher in a new era of program efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: and respect for patient privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: State employees are drug screen for THC
and this alienates every single person
[SPEAKER_00]: standing in front of me to hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our program is overly expensive and
completely inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lack fundamental communication
resources and our renewal process is
[SPEAKER_00]: archaic, redundant and offers no respect
for housing and tenant rights as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic and congenital disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: This current OMMP inefficiency and
provocative move for expansion originates
[SPEAKER_00]: from a fundamental lack of compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: On behalf of our state representatives,
the polarity of compassion is judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This notion of labeling humans as patients
or as users is divisive and judgmental and
[SPEAKER_00]: creates unrest and inequality and
culminates in the form of a syntax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it be known here and now that the
death of medical cannabis will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: official rebirth of sacramental cannabis
protected by our First Amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body of us being familiar with being
forced underground will absolve our
[SPEAKER_00]: patient and caregiver status and renew our
citizen status where our activity is
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved in our founding documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nature is illegal, freedom cannot
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and blessed be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
