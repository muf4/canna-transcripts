[SPEAKER_00]: Join with us and make a big ol' scene
because if we're all together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really loud and they can't ignore us
any longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes everybody here to go out there
and to make a difference, talk to your
[SPEAKER_02]: legislature because now they're going to
be running for office, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: coming asking you for your vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want your vote so you don't have to
ask them where do they stand on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to stop us, they're just
going to incarcerate us and it needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: end yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana is not going to re-legalize
itself and if you're not registered to
[SPEAKER_03]: vote then you're not going to be part of
making a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to stop pretending that the drug
war is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to stop pretending that DARE is
working because none of them are working.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them are working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, please do what you can to support
ending cannabis prohibition as we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's real important to
support the Okta, the I-24, the sensibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whatever that comes upon you for
freedom, man, and for what your rights
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of these, they're so close,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all on this train, they're
different, they're all part of different
[SPEAKER_00]: groups, but they're all on the same train
and they get on that train in the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: and they cruise forward and that's what we
got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our train in our community is one train
and that's the cannabis train and we all
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get on the cannabis train and chug
a lug for freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
you you you you
