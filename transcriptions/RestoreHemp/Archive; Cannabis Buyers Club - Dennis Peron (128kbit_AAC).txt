[SPEAKER_14]: This is not a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a war on my kids that need medical
marijuana to make their day pleasant,
[SPEAKER_14]: to help them relieve the symptoms of
nausea, to get over the symptoms of
[SPEAKER_14]: chemotherapy, to make them feel good each
day they get up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what this war is about.
[SPEAKER_14]: Turn on all your friends, all your
relatives, all your grandmas and grandpas.
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell them that this war on marijuana is
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome to the Buyers Club.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got today all kinds of food goods.
[SPEAKER_16]: All the food is five dollars a piece.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are peanut butter cookies,
these are chocolate chip cookies,
[SPEAKER_16]: banana bread made by my partner,
rice krispies made by Larry who also works
[SPEAKER_16]: here at the Buyers Club, and cooking
marijuana, cooking leaf.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is so this way you can cook these
things at home for yourself and be able to
[SPEAKER_16]: make your own.
[SPEAKER_16]: Tincture, it's marijuana blended in vodka.
[SPEAKER_16]: You just take a few drops of that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have marijuana that you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_16]: Depending upon the quality of it
determines the price.
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, this being the most potent,
this is the most expensive one.
[SPEAKER_16]: With the sliding scale.
[SPEAKER_16]: The two here are California green and
these two to the left are Mexican.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is 40, this is 65 and 75.
[SPEAKER_16]: 75 is very, very pungent, very aromatic.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to tell you a little bit about
the Buyers Club and how it came into
[SPEAKER_10]: being.
[SPEAKER_10]: My best friend, my water brother of 14
years, Jonathan West, had AIDS.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonathan was taking a myriad of drugs like
every AIDS patient and all those drugs had
[SPEAKER_10]: severe side effects from constant nausea
to appetite suppressing and to making you
[SPEAKER_10]: feel really bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one drug that was really helping
Jonathan was marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the one drug that allowed him to
ease his nausea, to stimulate his
[SPEAKER_10]: appetite.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and it was the one drug that made him
feel a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_10]: When Jonathan died, me and my friends
collected 16,000 signatures to put a
[SPEAKER_10]: medical marijuana initiative on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the people of San Francisco responded
by 80% to legalize marijuana as a medicine
[SPEAKER_10]: to help people with AIDS and cancer and
multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Board of Supervisors in a resolution
741-92 ordered the district attorney and
[SPEAKER_10]: the chief of police to place the marijuana
enforcement laws for medical purposes as
[SPEAKER_10]: to be their lowest priority.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marijuana, although it is illegal,
helps people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working to legalize it for these
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And one only has to spend one day at the
Buyers Club to know that this is a
[SPEAKER_10]: medicine that works for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_27]: My kids turned me on when I was in my late
40s, I think.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm 75 now.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I didn't used to smoke it regularly.
[SPEAKER_27]: I just smoked it when they were around and
we celebrated, you know.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I was diagnosed with glaucoma a year
ago, April, and I'd been told for years
[SPEAKER_27]: that it would help the pressure of
glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, you'd go blind with glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I went to my ophthalmologist expecting
him to be able to write up a prescription,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I found out that it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_27]: I hadn't paid all that much attention to
it before, you know.
[SPEAKER_27]: I sort of knew it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, then I started writing letters to
officials and one thing or another.
[SPEAKER_27]: I wrote a letter to Angela Alioto,
who is the president of San Francisco
[SPEAKER_27]: Board of Supervisors.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I told her, I had heard that her
husband who had had cancer and had used
[SPEAKER_27]: marijuana to help him through his death.
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, I wrote her a letter about what
was on my mind and she wrote me back and
[SPEAKER_27]: told me to call Dennis.
[SPEAKER_27]: Never even heard of Dennis before.
[SPEAKER_27]: And this was maybe last January.
[SPEAKER_27]: So I called him and Dennis invited me up
and having glaucoma is an in for me.
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we all who are members here are
sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have a letter of diagnosis
from your doctor, HIV, cancer,
[SPEAKER_10]: multiple sclerosis, serious back injuries,
paralyzed, disc injuries.
[SPEAKER_10]: Essentially anything a marijuana is good
for.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have the anorexia, the marijuana
would work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for pain management, marijuana works.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're extremely depressed,
instead of Prozac, marijuana does work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use marijuana because it helps me relax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a really bad car crash in 1987
and my neck and shoulder was injured and
[SPEAKER_03]: they go into spasms sometimes and it gives
me terrible headaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I smoke some marijuana, it helps all
those muscles stay relaxed and I don't get
[SPEAKER_03]: headaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can avoid it and prevent them rather
than wait until it gets really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an HIV-related kind of arthritis of
the spine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called writer's syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it helps with my pain, helps me sleep
and keep up my appetite.
[SPEAKER_25]: It alleviates nausea, helps calm me down.
[SPEAKER_25]: It relaxes me and it helps me control just
kind of manipulate stress instead of
[SPEAKER_25]: letting stress manipulate me.
[SPEAKER_25]: It helps me be more calm and it makes me
laugh.
[SPEAKER_25]: It makes me look at life in a perspective
perhaps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, basically I'm here because of three
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can get pot in better quality
consistently and cheaper here than I can
[SPEAKER_12]: on the street, which is more of a
practical reason.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in terms of the medical reason is the
fact that I've got something called
[SPEAKER_12]: drusen's in the optic nerve.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically a sort of wart-like
excrescence in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_12]: On my retinal memory.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what it does, it is decreasing my
field of vision as well as increasing the
[SPEAKER_12]: pressure in my eyes and also produces a
lack of binocular focus.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I smoke a pot, it helps reduce the
pressure and brings back my binocular
[SPEAKER_12]: focus so I can see someone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Still can't see completely, but I can see
a lot better after I've smoked a joint
[SPEAKER_12]: than I could beforehand.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically to restore appetite that
eradication takes away.
[SPEAKER_20]: To make sleep easier as it corrects
against insomnia.
[SPEAKER_20]: Spiritual reasons, I acknowledge the need
in all human beings to get high.
[SPEAKER_20]: To remove themselves temporarily out of an
everyday frame of mind.
[SPEAKER_20]: Or another frame of mind when that's,
you might say, somewhat exalted over the
[SPEAKER_20]: everyday.
[SPEAKER_17]: It gives me a great deal of relaxation.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm in a serious, depressed state.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have MS and it's hard to believe that
seven or eight years ago I was able to
[SPEAKER_17]: ride my bicycle from here to Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_17]: This place is really great to get
marijuana from because, for one thing,
[SPEAKER_17]: you don't have to take your chances out on
the street like going to Delores Park,
[SPEAKER_17]: for example, where you're never quite sure
what quality you're getting or if you're
[SPEAKER_17]: going to be robbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reality is the medical marijuana clubs
have operated without interference from
[SPEAKER_01]: local police or federal drug agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our manpower doesn't permit to really
operate at the street level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a low priority right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it would be.
[SPEAKER_23]: I really think the individuals involved
with that program are very sincere and
[SPEAKER_23]: they're trying to do something to
alleviate their pain versus other methods.
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's something that the justice
system has not responded to that
[SPEAKER_23]: particular social need yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got involved with Shanti to begin with
when the epidemic first broke and from
[SPEAKER_08]: there I went to San Francisco General
Hospital in the AIDS Outpatient Board.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been there, I call them all my kids
because anyone who could have been,
[SPEAKER_08]: they could have been yours, they could
have been anybody in this room.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was baking at a safety house.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was baking for about 20 or 25 kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever I could get enough leaf donated,
I would bake as many brownies as I could
[SPEAKER_08]: for the leaf that was donated and I would
deliver them to kids with AIDS,
[SPEAKER_08]: free of charge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then of course I got busted and that
seemed to be the shocker around the world
[SPEAKER_08]: for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: They wish they'd never ever busted me.
[SPEAKER_08]: My kid was selling a little marijuana on
the side to you know for a little extra
[SPEAKER_08]: income and they were basically after him
and I was up there baking that day and
[SPEAKER_08]: they got me too and thought they,
yay, they said guess who we've got here,
[SPEAKER_08]: Brownie Mary.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they thought that was a big deal,
however it really backfired on them.
[SPEAKER_08]: The book is basically Dennis' and all the
other people that made contributions to
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: My contribution was just the recipes,
and the story of my activism.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all kinds of good recipes in the
book.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a great shrimp casserole,
there's a rice side dish, there's a black
[SPEAKER_08]: bean soup, macaroni and cheese,
hemp salad dressing, chestnut stuffing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a good recipe for chocolate chips
and so we all did this book and put it
[SPEAKER_08]: together and we've sold only 5,000 copies.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just about out and going into the
second edition.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now we have 22 people working here,
from the bakers to the scale people to
[SPEAKER_10]: doorman and to people that just roll their
joints for the people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone that works here has either got
AIDS, cancer or multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_10]: We hire from the community to serve the
community.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any screens for this?
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm the baker, I make the cookies.
[SPEAKER_24]: There are several ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_24]: THC is dilutable in any kind of oil or
butter.
[SPEAKER_24]: There's another way of using alcohol and
increasing the potency, which I'm just
[SPEAKER_24]: experimenting with.
[SPEAKER_24]: So far I've just used my leaf in a crock
pot with butter, let it soak overnight and
[SPEAKER_24]: then get magnificent results from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a medical marijuana brownie,
it says here right on the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't quite have the fact statement
on there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy said it was really good and I'm
going to have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually only going to have half of it
because the whole one will make me feel
[SPEAKER_02]: sleepy, too sleepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather do it at home, the whole thing
at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: These aren't Mary's brownies, these are
somebody else makes these.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get a chance to get one of Mary's
brownies, those are the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking gives me that right away feeling,
but this actually takes an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: or so to really start to feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have HIV.
[SPEAKER_22]: As a matter of fact, the drugs that the
surgeons gave me to alleviate the pain
[SPEAKER_22]: before and after surgery are toxic and
marijuana isn't.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I became an addict of prescription
drugs.
[SPEAKER_22]: I've really never used marijuana in my
life.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was 220 pounds, I had terrible pain from
my surgery, I couldn't even move without
[SPEAKER_22]: pain.
[SPEAKER_22]: Now I'm 170 pounds, I bike 20 to 30 miles
a day in rural Butte County without that
[SPEAKER_22]: much pain.
[SPEAKER_22]: I am in school and getting a 4.0 GPA and a
very hard graduate program.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 73 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been smoking pot for 60 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to eat it, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started to smoke pocket pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not considered a drug, but rather
of a nerve.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother used to take the stem and make
tea out of it and give it to us on honey
[SPEAKER_04]: for our menstrual pains.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people say that Mexican is harsher to
smoke, that the taste is more irritating.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's really probably the key
difference between green bud and Mexican
[SPEAKER_16]: pot.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a green bud, usually your high is
a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_16]: In Mexican you need to smoke some more
relatively thin to keep your buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people are not able to smoke
it because of their lungs, because of
[SPEAKER_05]: their respiratory systems and hearts,
what have you, and smoking is bad for
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So eating it really is becoming more and
more popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more and more creative.
[SPEAKER_05]: These actually really caught on,
these Rice Krispies, these really caught
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It somehow tastes right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The taste of marijuana is odd.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing tops homemade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like this, this is an ounce of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the shake and the leaf from the
flowers that this is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is enough pot, we sell this for
what, $15, enough pot to make a batch of
[SPEAKER_05]: brownies, about 12 doses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Homemade is really good because when you
first take it out of the oven and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: hot, it is heated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like slightly smoldering.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in this little baked form and
they're very, very potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a batch of brownies, when you take
those brownies out and you eat one of
[SPEAKER_05]: those brownies, that's like way more than
enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly if I'm going to eat it,
I probably would eat it in a cookie form,
[SPEAKER_05]: usually brownie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or sometimes I might make something
special like pancakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But usually I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't care.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not picky.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's not picky.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're hungry, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_18]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: How much of this would you say?
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's two grams in there,
so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_18]: Two and a half.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm probably going to use more than you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think maybe half?
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll start off with your smallest amount.
[SPEAKER_19]: Give her like quarter of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: If it doesn't work, then you give her
another quarter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything here has medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything here is available to the
members.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's calculated by weight and the same way
we buy it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you can see, we have a chart.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is everything?
[SPEAKER_05]: Stems and different grades.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a high art, as a matter of fact,
of growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these are beautifully tendered and
manicured.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell people really put a lot of
energy into their gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really just a little bit less
quality because the flowers that crumble
[SPEAKER_05]: to dry differently.
[SPEAKER_21]: I was diagnosed in April of... Well,
I was HIV positive in April of 89.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was diagnosed with AIDS May of last
year.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I gained approximately 15 pounds in
six weeks.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's very good for me because I lost a
lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_21]: Almost 20 pounds.
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, my name is Beth and I work here.
[SPEAKER_26]: I do a variety of things.
[SPEAKER_26]: Greeting people, signing them up,
giving them hugs, helping them at the
[SPEAKER_26]: counter, showing them around.
[SPEAKER_26]: I am HIV positive myself.
[SPEAKER_26]: I love that we're like a big family.
[SPEAKER_26]: The people that come in here, when they
leave, they feel just a little bit more
[SPEAKER_26]: loved and at ease than they did when they
came in.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen people improve.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen people come in having to be
carried up the stairs.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've seen people come in later.
[SPEAKER_26]: These same people come in later with just
walking up the stairs with maybe a little
[SPEAKER_26]: bit of help.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen definite improvement.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've experienced this myself.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've just seen a lot of miracles.
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of miracles here.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of us does.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can get 3,100 very sick people
searching their parks for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: They get 3,100 people in their jails.
[SPEAKER_10]: These people are at the bottom in the
winter of their lives.
[SPEAKER_10]: They deserve every respect society can
give them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I may have to pay a price someday.
[SPEAKER_10]: But a prison for what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I believe in what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: The club is open.
[SPEAKER_10]: One just has to be here one day to know
that we are doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That we are helping people in a crisis
time in their life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can say this club is about
marijuana, but it is really about love and
[SPEAKER_10]: compassion.
[SPEAKER_07]: The organizations we run out of here would
be Americans for Compassionate Use,
[SPEAKER_07]: Californians for Compassionate Use.
[SPEAKER_07]: We feel calls from all over America.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every day we get calls from people out
there that want information on this topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've been trying in our own humble
little way to influence national policy in
[SPEAKER_07]: this area as best we as a citizen activist
group can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was passed by both Houses of the
California State Legislature by a nice
[SPEAKER_07]: margin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a bipartisan vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: Republicans in both Houses passed this
bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: We lobbied for this bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the honor of going up there with
Dennis on numerous occasions and watching
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the patients also go up there and
testify for the bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was quite a process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dennis actually and some of the patients
went door to door, legislature to
[SPEAKER_07]: legislature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was quite a thing to see because
Dennis is a master.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was something we'd step back and
generally watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: He really had to see this to understand
the power of speech.
[SPEAKER_07]: His voice would go up and the
infectiousness of his characteristic of
[SPEAKER_07]: what he was explaining would go up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these offices aren't that big.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually you've got another legislator in
the back room.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Dennis talking directly and
discussing directly with these legislators
[SPEAKER_07]: without just pure on its own merits and
really swaying them with the conviction of
[SPEAKER_07]: argument.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really something to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't personally get to see the
governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we brought 30 patients by and we
presented the governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dennis presented the governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: The governor threw his office with a major
pile of materials in support of the bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: California's for Compassionate Use is
spearheading a statewide ballot
[SPEAKER_07]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_07]: The vote will take place in November of
1996.
[SPEAKER_07]: The voters in the state of California will
at that point be able to decide if it's
[SPEAKER_07]: okay for a sick person to grow a couple of
plants of marijuana and use it for
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine with the oversight of their
physician.
[SPEAKER_15]: Coming out here to support the Canvas
Buyers Club.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to tell you a little bit what's
been happening at the club.
[SPEAKER_15]: For over two years we have been operating
without police interference and we have
[SPEAKER_15]: served 4,000 people.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're at our door on Wednesday videotaping
members following sick people home.
[SPEAKER_15]: Arrassing AIDS patients and cancer
patients in the sunset of their lives.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's not right and we're here to
tell them to leave us alone.
[SPEAKER_15]: The people of San Francisco are behind us.
[SPEAKER_15]: The politicians of San Francisco are
behind us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor George is behind us.
[SPEAKER_15]: The board is to the right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in fact the cops have sent us three
members who have AIDS or a body pot in
[SPEAKER_15]: Dolores Park.
[SPEAKER_15]: They sent them to the club.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even the police in San Francisco support
us.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going silently into the night.
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be dragged into that building.
[SPEAKER_15]: I am fighting for your rights,
for any medicine you have in the sunset of
[SPEAKER_15]: your life.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here to protect you and if they arrest
me they are arresting you.
[SPEAKER_11]: If they close these clubs people will
surely die.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they have to know that because we know
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've watched our friends and our families
puke themselves to death on the modern
[SPEAKER_11]: medical miracles of today's science.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we know this herb helps them and we're
not going to let them close the clubs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I don't know about you, but I'm also
not going to let Dennis Perrone go to jail
[SPEAKER_11]: alone.
[SPEAKER_11]: This building with Dennis Perrone's name
on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they know what they can do with their
warrant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I started selling marijuana in 1970 and
I've paid a dear price for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Including getting arrested, jailed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge jury trials.
[SPEAKER_10]: 1977, again, I was arrested for running
the big top pot supermarket.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of the one stop shopping.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three scales, no waiting, treated like a
king.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my friend Harvey Milk and I conspired
to legalize marijuana on the 1978 ballot
[SPEAKER_10]: by Proposition W.
[SPEAKER_10]: We won that vote.
[SPEAKER_10]: By 58%.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Harvey Milk, in a note to my jail
cell, told me he was going to see that it
[SPEAKER_10]: was enforced.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that no city funds were going to be
allocated to enforce the marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that wasn't to be because Harvey Milk
was gunned down by an assassin's bullet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also put a bullet through the
marijuana movement's heart because C.
[SPEAKER_10]: Harvey was our spokesman.
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to my wall.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a poster of when I ran for charter
commissioner.
[SPEAKER_10]: I ran for charter commissioner when I was
in jail for selling marijuana for the pot
[SPEAKER_10]: supermarket.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Harvey Milk endorsed me for that race.
[SPEAKER_10]: I unfortunately lost, but not by much.
[SPEAKER_10]: And not before Dan White denounced me and
Harvey Milk in front of the board of
[SPEAKER_10]: supervisors.
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, I had Proposition W on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, unfortunately, was in jail for the
November election.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did see my initiative win by 58%.
[SPEAKER_10]: And myself come within 1,500 votes of
actually winning a seat on the charter
[SPEAKER_10]: commissioner.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now my restaurant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was the Island Restaurant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in the heart of the Castro district
in Harvey Milk's headquarters for a 75 and
[SPEAKER_10]: 76 assembly race.
[SPEAKER_10]: He used my restaurant.
[SPEAKER_10]: As his campaign headquarters for that
race.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he didn't win that race, but that was
not to be because he was meant to win the
[SPEAKER_10]: race in 1977 when he became the first
openly gay elected supervisor and elected
[SPEAKER_10]: official in the whole country.
[SPEAKER_10]: And his legacy was one of love and
community.
[SPEAKER_10]: He showed the world a lot of hope and
compassion.
