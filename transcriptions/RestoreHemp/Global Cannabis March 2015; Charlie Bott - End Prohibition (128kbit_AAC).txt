[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, a lot of people might know
me from the cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there from most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, it'll have a location sometime
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot more people know me from
Facebook, where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, as soon as I got on Facebook
back in 2008, was very about the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: I got hooked up with Oregon Normal through
going to the meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we gave away clones and medicine to
people who couldn't afford to buy it or
[SPEAKER_00]: have their own growers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got very involved with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy for the chance to talk here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important not only to talk to
your legislatures, but also to talk just
[SPEAKER_00]: to your family and your friends who are
not out here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preaching to the choir is a wonderful
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll do it a lot if you get the chance
to speak to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people you talk to will be
people who agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of people out there who
will listen to reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see, passing the measure 91 here
at 56% was a big victory for our movement
[SPEAKER_00]: and the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when several months before,
the year before, we were told by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Marylander Policy Project that we
shouldn't seek to legalize in 2014 because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was an off-year election and people
wouldn't come out and things wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen because of experience they had in
the past with gay marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a great issue and I'm glad to see
that moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another issue that has unstoppable
momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at consistent polling
across the country, which puts support for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana at 80% and higher among
the general population, it's time for the
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians to just get with the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to make that happen again is to
contact your legislatures, write letters,
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this SB 844, which Erin was talking
about a minute ago, where they're making
[SPEAKER_00]: changes to the medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've emailed back and forth with Peter
Buckley and some of the suggestions that I
[SPEAKER_00]: made actually made it into the latest
amendments structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to do things right and they
know that there's a lot at stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're listening and it's very good
to see that happening here and to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: an example for the people who will come
after us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in 2016, we'll probably see
legalization initiatives in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get the whole west coast legal for
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nevada, possibly Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and Maine are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it through the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio supposedly has half the signatures
they need to get it on the ballot for
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passing legalization in Ohio in an odd
year would be almost unthinkable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it may happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while all this good stuff is happening
and we're given a good example,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are still being executed around the
world for cannabis trafficking crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last weekend in Indonesia, one of the nine
people who were put in front of a firing
[SPEAKER_00]: squad was a cannabis trafficker and he was
killed for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every year, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, a couple other
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries, there's about nine
around the world that still execute people
[SPEAKER_00]: for drug crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the drug war just has to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The violence we saw last week in Maryland
around the Freddie Gray killing is made
[SPEAKER_00]: possible by the no-knock raids and other
exorbitant measures that have just become
[SPEAKER_00]: everyday events for the police to put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been SWAT raids and no-knock
raids and people just shouldn't be dying
[SPEAKER_00]: for this plant that can save so many
people and which we're finding out now,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the hemp side of things, we can make
batteries for a small fraction of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, graphene level batteries that will
hold a tremendous charge for a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time at a much much cheaper cost
than it would to make it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically otherwise derived stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things are going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see Brave McHale up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that last month in
Kansas, an 11-year-old boy was in a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: education class and they were talking
about how they think people should avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and it had evil, ill health
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this 11-year-old stood up and said,
no, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saved my mother's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went down to list all the good
things that cannabis does for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that ended up with him being taken
away from his mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Shona Banda, who's a woman,
again, she's in Kansas, she saved her
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had Crohn's disease and was on the
brink of death and discovered that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil could save her and now she's
instead of being bedridden and not being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to even hold her kid, which she was
at the time, she's an activist and she's
[SPEAKER_00]: lost her kid for the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stuff is still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people dying and there's the
legislation that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of legislation coming out in
places like Oklahoma of all places and
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's CBD only laws, which people
want because CBD is very helpful with
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures and stuff and it doesn't get you
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that keeps out the THC, which does so
much for so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant medicine is really the way
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything other than that is an excuse
for the police to be able to still keep
[SPEAKER_00]: arresting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me speak today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give a shout out to L.K.,
who's here and who told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to introduce me to people in the
cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would say, if someday your kids aren't
getting arrested for smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to be the guy you want to
thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like the biggest honor I've
gotten from anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just for posting on Facebook
and not shutting up about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not done with this fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact your legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell people back in your home states,
if you moved to Oregon like I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to their legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% support and politicians are afraid to
support it still in places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time and look forward to
the march later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
