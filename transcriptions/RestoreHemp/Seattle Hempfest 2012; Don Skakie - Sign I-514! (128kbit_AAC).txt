[SPEAKER_00]: hey everybody let's get legal let's get
fully legal let's get so legal that you
[SPEAKER_00]: and I and everybody else can grow our own
and when we grow our own let's not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay a big fee and let's just keep some of
it in the hands of the people I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: know a lot of good people that grow a lot
of good medicine a lot of good herb and
[SPEAKER_00]: they should be able to continue to do that
Vivian just said about the Canada cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: economy and I got to tell you that is
exactly what we need we need the wealth of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and cannabis through mom-and-pop
small businesses all across Washington we
[SPEAKER_00]: need it in the farms we need it in
boutique winery style rows where cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: tourists could come and take a little bus
trip and all of that we need to grow hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Okanagan area because that ground
there some of it is so bad it would just
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from hemp so much and the people
there the unemployment is so high that
[SPEAKER_00]: they would have living wage jobs and I
want to remind you all this can happen but
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a vote on it all right we've got
initiative 514 so if you want to grow your
[SPEAKER_00]: own and you have to sign the petition you
have to register to vote get it done we
[SPEAKER_00]: have until December 31st to get these all
these signatures on this November the
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative that's currently on the ballot
will pass or fail with a piece of people
[SPEAKER_00]: of Washington on its own merits I advise
each and every one of you to number one go
[SPEAKER_00]: out and register a vote and number two
read what you are voting on don't listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to what anybody tells you because you're
smart enough to read this for yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a long read 68 pages but know what
you're voting on anybody vote on alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we had a surprise of hey where
that extra 30% tax come from there you go
[SPEAKER_00]: right there you know what make sure you
read it okay after November it is either
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna pass or fail and I want to let you
know that a lot of people that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with 502 I are not quitting we are
not you know 502 is not the be all and end
[SPEAKER_00]: all of cannabis reform certainly not in
Washington State and the fact that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: running this right now proves that there's
another group that's well known in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State for running initiatives
and I hear that they may or may not run
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative in 2013 but it doesn't matter
if it's us or them or whoever else comes
[SPEAKER_00]: next until cannabis is legal for each and
every one of you and your families and
[SPEAKER_00]: loved ones and friends and neighbors to
benefit absolutely benefit from having
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis available to you I don't know
what else to tell you we will not quit
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization is the safest access for our
patients you know when you put it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy where anybody can give it away or
traded or handed over your fence like a
[SPEAKER_00]: zucchini to your neighbor the quality
there's no reason why it can't stay up
[SPEAKER_00]: because we all believe in it but there's
every reason why the price should go down
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want you to consider that when that
price goes down you can either shove it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the gut hands of the government to
use what they want or you can keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: money in your own pockets and go spend it
out in your own neighborhoods your own
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and grow your business imagine
all the money currently spent on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: now going into the legitimate economy you
know full-time jobs benefits for people
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want also tell you when you can grow
your own in the backyard how much energy
[SPEAKER_00]: are we gonna save all those thousand watt
lights not burning oh my god Puget Sound
[SPEAKER_00]: energy is not gonna know what to do
because our energy bills are gonna go down
[SPEAKER_00]: because we'll have a surplus there is so
much I want you to all consider everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've told you I want you to consider
what's in the current legislation I want
[SPEAKER_00]: you to come by Sealy stage up here we are
in the booth right behind Sealy stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: we will be there all weekend collecting
your signatures registering you to vote so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can make an honest and informed
choice about what vision of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization you want for yourself your
friends your family and your state and
[SPEAKER_00]: countrymen so sign I-514 get this on the
ballot if you don't sign it now the closer
[SPEAKER_00]: we come to December 31st the chance will
be that we won't be ready to go in January
[SPEAKER_00]: of 2013 if we can qualify this we will be
in front of the legislature in January of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013 just two months after whatever
happens in the election happen so please
[SPEAKER_00]: read it I love it it was written by a
father who's worried about cannabis being
[SPEAKER_00]: in the schools when his kids are going
there when he wants him to concentrate on
[SPEAKER_00]: their schoolwork and this guy is a
consumer and a patient and he knows he
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't want the highest paid job for a
high school student dropout or otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: to be drug dealer he doesn't want our
patients that have had their access in
[SPEAKER_00]: eastern Washington cut off and if you
haven't heard about it you know Spokane
[SPEAKER_00]: was first Wenatchee is now facing problems
you know Seattle could be coming next you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Thurston County we don't know what
they'll do but when we speak out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: voice and tell them no we're gonna have it
for ourselves and we're gonna set the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules that's where they're gonna have to
listen we don't create any law when you
[SPEAKER_00]: create law you can conflict with the
federal government and you lose we do what
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible Washington has done for the past
few years and that's remove the penalties
[SPEAKER_00]: for adults and when you do that the
federal government is forced to use its
[SPEAKER_00]: own resources to come after us just like
they did with alcohol prohibition back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 20s in the 30s so don't let them have
it we take away the penalties we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want the big cartels coming in we limit a
grow size to 400 square feet which is
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20 by 20 if you live in a rural area
that's a nice outdoor garden because we
[SPEAKER_00]: need a legitimate source of good cannabis
in Washington State we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage the cartels to come in with huge
grows out in the forest and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else we should be able to come together as
individuals and collect our 400 square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet together and work together not as a
corporation but as collectives and
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals keep cannabis safe keep
cannabis for the people we love you
[SPEAKER_00]: hempfest you roll
