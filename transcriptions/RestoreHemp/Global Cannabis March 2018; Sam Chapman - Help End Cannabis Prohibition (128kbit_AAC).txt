[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't take too much of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my name is Sam Chapman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was raised by most of the old activists
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the main reasons I'm
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been cracking old jokes for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, who am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been involved with drug policy
reform, but I think I like reconstruction
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug policy reconstruction for almost a
decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that I got involved with drug
policy is through my white privilege.
[SPEAKER_00]: In high school, I was always in a position
of leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sophomore class president,
senior year, I was ASB vice president.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran the morning and afternoon
announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the administration knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my senior year, I was smoking some
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went on a lunchtime drive with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was followed by the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came back to the school,
I was pulled aside by a cop and the school
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor who said, Sam, we have reason to
believe that you are intoxicated on
[SPEAKER_00]: campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you submit to a drug sobriety test?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know my rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't been introduced to the full
breadth of the ACLU yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I submitted to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I passed everything but counting backwards
from 60 with my eyes closed because
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently my eyes dilated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Counted perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, long story short, they gave me an
ultimatum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you get the hell out of this high
school right now and you don't walk with
[SPEAKER_00]: your class, which I said, great,
get me out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to college anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or go to a two hour drug and alcohol
counseling class because we think you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, okay, I'll go to the counseling
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two hours into this drug and alcohol
counseling class, admitting to the drugs I
[SPEAKER_00]: had taken, the fact that I was going to
college, that I actually wasn't a terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: human being because I enjoyed to smoke
cannabis every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The counselor looked up at me and smiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Sam, I'm really sorry you had to
come here today because there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, I didn't realize it,
but I went to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down to the University of Oregon
and I discovered a group called Students
[SPEAKER_00]: for Sensible Drug Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you know, for those who don't,
Students for Sensible Drug Policy is a
[SPEAKER_00]: global nonprofit organization run by
students who care about reforming our very
[SPEAKER_00]: outdated drug laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe that they neither condone nor
condemn drug use, but they realize that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all, each and every one of us has the
ability to put what we want in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so long as we are not harming other
people, we should be allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through SSDP, I met a lot of the activists
you see here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got involved with Measure 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who remembers Measure 74?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to both Jim Adams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got involved as a college outreach
coordinator with Measure 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, throughout college,
I was involved in various drug policy
[SPEAKER_00]: reform efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after I graduated, I got involved
with legislative lobbying.
[SPEAKER_00]: People kept asking me, are you going to go
to law school?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, do I have to to write laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer was no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go to law school to
write laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense, attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no attorney, trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to go to law school to
write laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have a specific
education to make change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to have a fire and a passion
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I realized, after joining SSDP,
how lucky I was as a white male who got
[SPEAKER_00]: off and still got to go to college,
who did not get my financial aid taken
[SPEAKER_00]: away from me because I smoke cannabis,
I realized that's what I wanted to do for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to fight for drug policy reform
because I got lucky, because I was white,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I came from a rural town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, after Measure 80,
unfortunately, had failed, it had
[SPEAKER_00]: unlimited possession, unlimited growing,
which was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: 47% of Oregonians voted for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we knew we were going to get
legalized the next round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that happened, I was involved with
co-authoring the law that legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, Measure 91 and Anthony
Johnson, who I do not believe is here yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the Measure 91 crew came through and
56% of Oregonians said, yes, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: time to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what am I working on now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Social consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants to be able to go to a cannabis
lounge inside sometime?
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, so is there anyone here not from
Portland that's visiting, touring around,
[SPEAKER_00]: raise your hand, give us a clap,
yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Visiting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you allowed to smoke in the place that
you're staying right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any idea where you could
legally consume cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in public, not here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the big issue that I'm working
on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of other issues in the
industry right now that a lot of more
[SPEAKER_00]: qualified people are working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last regular legislative session,
I drafted and introduced Senate Bill 307,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a very simple bill to legalize
cannabis lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea was that localities could decide
to opt in if they chose to, like the city
[SPEAKER_00]: of Portland has expressed they have
interest in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to amend the Indoor Clean Air
Act because the Indoor Clean Air Act says,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't smoke cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the defenders of the Indoor Clean Air
Act are public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as often of reasonable and smart
people that they are, still are not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: on board with social consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're working on this
legislative session.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to legalize cannabis lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to legalize special events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to allow temporary sales
and samples of cannabis at events just
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wait, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do it without you, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a resident here in Oregon,
that means that you are represented by
[SPEAKER_00]: someone in the state legislature,
whether it be in the House or the Senate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have several representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the time comes and you'll know when
it is, because we're going to be loud and
[SPEAKER_00]: proud about the fact that we're doing this
this session, we're going to need you to
[SPEAKER_00]: contact those representatives and let them
know why it's so important that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: safe legal access for consuming cannabis
here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, there are plenty of people who don't
own their homes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People who live in section eight housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government's not going to let
you smoke indoors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This also means that disproportionately
affects people who do not have homes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw in Seattle and Denver over the last
couple of years, even though they legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, there are still disproportional
arrest rates of people of color for
[SPEAKER_00]: citations, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not over yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need your help to get across this
finish line so we can help other states
[SPEAKER_00]: get to where we are now so we can make
sure that no one ever goes to jail again
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Sam Chapman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy this great weekend.
