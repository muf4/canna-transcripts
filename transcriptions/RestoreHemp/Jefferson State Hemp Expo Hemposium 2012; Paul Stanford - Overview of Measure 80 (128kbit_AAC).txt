[SPEAKER_04]: I am a true believer that the reason that
marijuana is illegal isn't about drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are a smokescreen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a myth that they made up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really about money, power,
and hip fuel, and hip fiber, primarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: They made up the whole marijuana myth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in 1911, Pacho Villa had a Mexican
revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a song they had called La
Cucaracha.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that song, they talk about the
cockroach that smokes marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after that happened, they
nationalized the petrochemical industry in
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Robert Barons in Texas and
Pennsylvania who ran those industries were
[SPEAKER_04]: not happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They created this whole marijuana myth
based on that word to play on the racist
[SPEAKER_04]: fears that were popular until recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we designed this bill to completely
reverse that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did it by allowing individuals to
cultivate their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for people who want to sell herb,
they would be able to get a license to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell it, get a license to process it,
and get a license to grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says in our initiative that the
licenses will be equitably distributed
[SPEAKER_04]: among all applicants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no one big grower will take advantage
of the whole market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in the Southeast, they have
tobacco allotments where the tobacco
[SPEAKER_04]: companies buy tobacco from farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're limited in the amount that
they can grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a certain number of acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: A farmer might have 500 acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll have one acre of tobacco,
499 acres of corn or sorghum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the acre of tobacco that makes as
much or more money than all the other put
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be the case once
we regulate the sale of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: We say in our initiative that hemp will
not be regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that no federal license is required to
grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to grow hemp under the bill that
passed in 2009, and that's a good bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Floyd Brzezanski, assistant DA and
state legislator, had worked on it for
[SPEAKER_04]: more than a dozen years.
[SPEAKER_04]: More than about five sessions as far as
five or six sessions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that requires that you grow this
hemp that's less than three-tenths of 1%
[SPEAKER_04]: THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that hemp is dwarf hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by limiting the THC, they limit the
output of all the products that come from
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only produces about half as much fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a 15th or a 20th as much seed oil and
protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we mandate that the hemp that will
be grown will be the hemp that produces
[SPEAKER_04]: the most fuel, fiber and food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that the high THC hemp with big
flowers and big seeds is going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: most productive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the whole idea that the hemp crop
is going to ruin the marijuana crop is not
[SPEAKER_04]: true because the marijuana crop and the
hemp crop will both be high THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't be the low THC hemp that they
force them to grow in Canada and force
[SPEAKER_04]: them to grow in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paul, I wanted to just mention we're
going to be discussing this right after
[SPEAKER_02]: this specifically about hemp and M80.
[SPEAKER_02]: Measure 80.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I'm glad you hit on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to spend too much time on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to focus M80's campaign on
hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wanted to break it into two parts a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really believe that the seed is what we
need.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need the seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the seed that's going to be the
most valuable product once we pass it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing our initiative does is it
names all the seeds and starts of all
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties of cannabis won't be regulated
and it will be considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way Monsanto can't come in here and
tell us our hemp is already free and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: been grown in this state for decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can't come in here and patent the
seed and sell it back to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the French seed is the only seed
that they can grow in those low THC
[SPEAKER_04]: countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a special patent and strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the few that's been
developed down to that low THC level,
[SPEAKER_02]: am I right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a new one that's down to .2%.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got us all on the law now to .3.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've developed a new one at .2.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's offspring naturally have more THC
than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't grow that seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But up in Canada, that's what they're
growing for is that low THC seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the primary economic product
they're producing for body products and
[SPEAKER_04]: food and that only makes about 600 pounds
of seed an acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: A study out in Notre Dame on Feral Hemp in
Southern Illinois and Central Illinois
[SPEAKER_04]: says that you'll get over 8,000 pounds of
seed per acre, 15 times more.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I think that's where the money
is going to be in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really going to be in seed oil and
seed protein especially as a fuel and that
[SPEAKER_04]: that fuel will be much cheaper than any
other seed oil that's out there today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the other seed oils it competes
against in terms of price for biodiesel
[SPEAKER_04]: today would be soybean oil, canola,
or rapeseed oil, and sunflower seed oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each of those produces about 100 to 120
gallons per acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if you're getting 8,000 pounds of
seed per acre, you're going to get about
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 gallons of oil and 600 pounds of high
protein hemp seed meal left over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where the money is
going to be at in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fiber will just be a byproduct of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you make corn into ethanol to make
fuel, you're taking food out of the supply
[SPEAKER_04]: chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So less people have food.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you make fuel from hemp, you're
putting food into the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jim a minute ago was talking about the
clear cutting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can obviously plant hemp instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know, I'm sure in this group,
that hemp makes much more paper,
[SPEAKER_04]: fabric, canvas, rope, lace, linen from its
stems than anything else on this planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that'll free that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we believe it'll raise about 200
million dollars a year in revenue for the
[SPEAKER_04]: state.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 60 million of that will be savings
in costs from locking up marijuana growers
[SPEAKER_04]: and dealers and processing possession
tickets and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: These numbers come from Harvard economist
Jeffrey Myron, who did a study nationally
[SPEAKER_04]: on this and has concentrated on Oregon as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we designed it specifically to be
upheld in the inevitable federal court
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge it'll face after passage.
[SPEAKER_04]: This violates federal law, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Controlled Substances Act and the
treaties that the United States
[SPEAKER_04]: spearheaded, the Single Convention Treaty,
the treaty actually mandates that it be a
[SPEAKER_04]: Schedule I drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the state of Oregon's Board of
Pharmacy led the way in making a Schedule
[SPEAKER_04]: II drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Iowa has now followed suit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a couple states, it's Schedule II
already.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as long as we can't legally grow it,
then there's no legal supply of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this will provide a legal supply to
sale to pharmacies that will allow it and
[SPEAKER_04]: sell to patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patients, marijuana will not be taxed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under our initiative, it says explicitly
that marijuana for patients will be sold
[SPEAKER_04]: at farmer's cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So adult marijuana smokers will subsidize
the medical patients who need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will also allow doctors to prescribe
marijuana for anything they think that it
[SPEAKER_04]: qualifies for.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't have to go through this
ridiculous process with the health
[SPEAKER_04]: authority.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird how they changed their name
from the health department to the health
[SPEAKER_04]: authority.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would allow doctors to recommend it
for anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the price would come way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Availability will be up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll create tens of thousands of
jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thousands of new companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And several new industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And put Oregon on the cutting edge of
exciting new economic and ecological
[SPEAKER_04]: development.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll see hemp biofuel become our
primary energy source for cars and ethanol
[SPEAKER_04]: from hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the world's largest industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of the Saudi princes and the
corporate stockholders putting it all the
[SPEAKER_04]: way in their Swiss bank accounts,
it'll go into our farmers' pockets where
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll spend it in our communities and
just change the whole economic paradigm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the goal here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a transformative initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just take questions and answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions you might have about
the initiative?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of quick questions before
I go to the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things you just mentioned was
the any condition clause, which I applaud
[SPEAKER_02]: you for putting in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people have pointed out that
there may be a conflict with the OMMA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also stated in there that it's left
intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the OMMA, of course, currently has
limitations on conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does that work itself out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they just have to switch the OMMA?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to switch the OMMA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you won't need a license to grow it
anymore or to possess it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, we wanted to keep it intact
in case we envision that the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: government is going to come in here and
enjoin this law before it goes into
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was designed especially for that
eventuality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to keep the OMMA intact and
separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are actually two severability
clauses at the very end of our initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't decide on which one to use,
so I put both of them in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the pieces of OMMA will still be
there while this is enjoined.
[SPEAKER_04]: The death with dignity law was passed here
in Oregon back in 1994.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it allowed doctors to prescribe
phenobarbital to help terminally ill
[SPEAKER_04]: patients kill themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that conflicted with federal law,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: The federal government came in and
enjoined that law.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fast-tracked through the federal
court system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 1996, in less than two years,
the Supreme Court came back and upheld the
[SPEAKER_04]: death with dignity law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been in effect ever since.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was similarly about doctors
prescribing phenobarbital.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that actually kind of leads to the
other question that I had about conflict
[SPEAKER_02]: with the feds over having state employees
who will be working for the OCC,
the Oregon Cannabis Commission,
not the Oregon Cannabis Connection.
Who will name it?
Yeah, that moniker will work OK for me,
probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a problem there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that the feds have made
threats to other states about prescribing
[SPEAKER_02]: or letting federal employees.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be enjoined in court.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while it's enjoined, we won't be able
to start growing big fields for adult use.
[SPEAKER_04]: But HIP is definitely allowed under
federal law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, it doesn't say anything in
federal law about THC level for HIP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And medical is also allowed under federal
law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the scheduling will be the issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it comes down to the international
treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: The international treaties say that if
implementing this scheduling system
[SPEAKER_04]: violates the human rights or the civil
rights of the parties signing it
[SPEAKER_04]: population, then those parties can
withdraw from those portions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're saying that not allowing us to
grow the oldest crop, the crop that was
[SPEAKER_04]: first sown at least 12,000 years ago,
and the crop that produces more fuel,
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber, food, and medicine than any other
violates our human rights in a number of
[SPEAKER_04]: ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: We set out seven points in a preamble that
are findings by the people under our
[SPEAKER_04]: system of government.
[SPEAKER_04]: The theory is that the people are
sovereign.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people are the rulers and below the
rulers is a constitution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to judicial precedent,
the Constitution and international
[SPEAKER_04]: treaties have equal weight in court
proceedings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Below that is federal statutes and state
municipal statutes are below that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the sovereign make these seven
findings based on historical, legal,
[SPEAKER_04]: scientific, and constitutional issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those findings are going to be
reviewed by the Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they agree, as most of us do,
that the people are sovereign,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not going to be able to overturn
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also, just for good measure,
implemented the system of controls for
[SPEAKER_04]: production that's mandated in the single
convention treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we have one central commission
saying that it will take control of the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire crop within four months of harvest
and say the areas and plots of land that
[SPEAKER_04]: are to be cultivated.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's language that's lifted from the
single convention treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the commission will hold electronic
possession, will be just as good as
[SPEAKER_04]: physical possession.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you want to have like a winery
or a brew pub group work today where you
[SPEAKER_04]: grow your own, you process it,
and you sell your product on your own
[SPEAKER_04]: land, that will be allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was the plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is to make cannabis inexpensive
for everyone and to free it for fuel,
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber, and food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, I really believe the
seed, fuel, and food are going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: primary economic product that we'll be
producing once we legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very tight piece of legislation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obvious you've worked on it for
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Started drafting in 1988.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hired a good friend of mine who's passed
away now, and we worked on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd spent through 200 drafts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had input from over 200 experts all
around the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did two polls to figure out what'd
be more likely to pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: The poll said, hey, don't put it in with
liquor because we'll lose a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage of voters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's the view that the OLCC's
corrupt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took it, you know, one of the things
we changed between 2008 and 2010 was
[SPEAKER_04]: setting up a cannabis commission that's
exclusively cannabis and saying that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the markets won't be merged,
kind of like what happens unless they
[SPEAKER_04]: outlaw it in the Netherlands where the
markets for hard drugs and marijuana are
[SPEAKER_04]: kept separate because they allow sales to
adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's open it up to anybody who's got
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the exportation of marijuana and
byproducts to other states or countries
[SPEAKER_02]: under how it's covered under.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we say that the price will be set to
discourage illegal imported exports.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at first the price will be higher
because we don't want it to be illegally
[SPEAKER_04]: shipped to Idaho or Nevada or any place
else where it can't be legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it says that the OCC, the Oregon
Cannabis Commission, will promote its sale
[SPEAKER_04]: in all legal national and international
markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as the other states start to regulate
it, say I-502 passes up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we produce it, we'll be able to ship
it to them because they would be a legal
[SPEAKER_04]: market and they'd be selling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the same would be true for any other
legitimate market as freedom spreads and
[SPEAKER_04]: people are able to buy it legally in all
the states because I really believe if we
[SPEAKER_04]: pass this here in Oregon, it will change
the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it passes in Colorado and
Washington, too, it's going to be a major
[SPEAKER_04]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see it'll be akin to the
toppling of the Berlin Wall, the toppling
[SPEAKER_04]: of the lemon statue in Red Square.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, freedom will ring around the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be those people, you know,
there are over a thousand people in the
[SPEAKER_04]: American jails.
[SPEAKER_04]: For 20 years or more, a hundred or so for
life without the possibility of parole
[SPEAKER_04]: right here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never owned a gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never threatened another person.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't steal anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just grew a plant and they're in
prison for life without the possibility of
[SPEAKER_04]: parole.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was charged for growing marijuana,
which I do with a license, if I had to go
[SPEAKER_04]: through the federal courts technically,
I could face life without the possibility
[SPEAKER_04]: of parole because I have priors for
growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this will change that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just think of those poor people in
Malaysia where they're hung for 200 grams
[SPEAKER_04]: or more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, if these things pass, this is just
going to be a ray of sunshine into our
[SPEAKER_04]: culture's life all over this world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we have a poll out in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a small poll.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried to fund the big poll.
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't able to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've gone ahead with a small poll and
we have a really catchy visual ad campaign
[SPEAKER_04]: that should come out sometime in the next
week or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be cutting more ads with
Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Willie Nelson did an ad for us in March
that was a big help.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to cut another ad for us here
just before our hemp stock festival.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is going to be one of the faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has five acres of land here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He started his songwriting career as a DJ
in Portland.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who don't know that,
Willie Nelson in the early sixties was a
[SPEAKER_04]: disc jockey on a country music station in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he started his songwriting career and
first wrote his first hits for Patsy
[SPEAKER_04]: Cline, that song Crazy, while he was a DJ
in Portland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he owns a big chunk of Sequential
Pacific Biodiesel, which is the largest
[SPEAKER_04]: biodiesel producer in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's one of the main spokespeople for
the National Biodiesel Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's opened a number of hemp and biodiesel
stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were Willie's truck stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sequential worked with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were in California, Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gone out of business now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's a big proponent of biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I first found out about biodiesel
in October of 1990 when I went back to
[SPEAKER_04]: Lexington, Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gatewood Galbrae took a few gallons of
biodiesel and poured it into his engine
[SPEAKER_04]: and drove from Lexington through the state
capitol in Frankfurt and on to Louisville
[SPEAKER_04]: where Willie did a concert for Gatewood.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a little aside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know, they misrepresented it
entirely.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took points from the preamble.
[SPEAKER_04]: At one of the seven preambles listed some
findings by three state supreme courts and
[SPEAKER_04]: the Schaeffer Commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck you talking about,
man?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so three state supreme courts,
the state of Alaska in Raven versus State,
[SPEAKER_04]: the state of Michigan in the people of
Michigan versus John Sinclair,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the state of Hawaii in a case with
Paul Cantor, the guitarist for the
[SPEAKER_04]: Jefferson Airplane and Starship.
[SPEAKER_04]: We based these set of findings on these
common issues in these three state supreme
[SPEAKER_04]: court rulings and in the Schaeffer
Commission that was commissioned by
[SPEAKER_04]: President Nixon back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they took these things in the
preamble and said that we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: force the kids to learn this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you look at the actual language
of the educational portion, it says that
[SPEAKER_04]: children will learn about the
scientifically accurate information about
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs and psychoactive substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say anything about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that they'll be taught accurate
information and how to the use of
[SPEAKER_04]: substances can harm their development and
discourage the use of those substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if as adults they decide to use
psychoactive substances, that they still
[SPEAKER_04]: have to responsibly fulfill all the duties
that they owe to other citizens under our
[SPEAKER_04]: social compact, such as, you know,
not hitting each other with a car,
[SPEAKER_04]: not beating each other up or stealing from
each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it just teaches civics,
you know, good old fashioned civics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get taught much anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I read that piece and I thought it
was kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that editorial was propaganda.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gave us an insight into how they're
going to get on you about Genesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another editorial in the
Portland Tribune a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the sheriffs and the prosecutors and
the police have basically said,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we're all going to go to hell in
a handbasket.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mexican cartels are going to move in
here and take over the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're all it's going to be Al Capone
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just the opposite of what the
actual truth is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if we have they want to
fight the argument, you know, using those
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of lies, it's just, you know,
the question is, how well can we get out
[SPEAKER_04]: our message about him, about George
Washington?
[SPEAKER_04]: And Thomas Jefferson and the founders,
depending on him and promoting him,
[SPEAKER_04]: George Washington wrote to Alexander
Hamilton and said, how can we promote him?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's the Secretary of the
Treasury.
[SPEAKER_04]: And would it be proper to to have a policy
encouraging cultivation of him?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what our initiative will do
is encourage the cultivation of him and
[SPEAKER_04]: finance and promote it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's really a transformative bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: For Paul?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm a disabled vet myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the thing is, this guy in Virginia,
who's also a veteran, Michael Kravitz,
[SPEAKER_04]: worked to get a policy through the VA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now the VA allows you to use
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a patient there and still be on their
paying contracts and still get their other
[SPEAKER_04]: health care and not use that against you
as long as you're following your state
[SPEAKER_04]: law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, is it champs or something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, we don't specifically
mandate that the government change that
[SPEAKER_04]: for at a federal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not in a position to make federal
law through the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that the Supreme Court will
enjoin it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of parts of this law, parts of it
will go into effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Parts of it won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that we built a proposal that can be
upheld in the inevitable federal court
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge it will face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to put our faith in the Supreme
Court to make this decision and not our
[SPEAKER_02]: legislators or ourselves again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But oh well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way that the legal I have no
confidence in the Supreme Court of John
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberts at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: initially, of course, we can't address
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is reciprocity for medical marijuana
card holders in five states and the
[SPEAKER_04]: District of Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite ironically, if you have a medical
marijuana permit, you're covered in the
[SPEAKER_04]: three states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to call them Michigan, Maine,
Montana, also Arizona and Rhode Island and
[SPEAKER_04]: the District of Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just carry your permit when you're
in those states and you're legal there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The folks at the Portland Airport let me
fly out with marijuana and my volcano all
[SPEAKER_04]: the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, let you fly out with a
pound and a half without any problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even had one TSA guy tell me his dad had
a volcano and loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that depend on where you're flying?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because you don't get checked when you
fly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They only check it when you fly,
where you fly from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you land, there's nobody there to
search you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're leaving Portland and you're
flying to New York City, you're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be legal in New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've flown from Portland, New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always carry pot wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I am just discreet and I haven't
had a problem with carrying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try not to bring much back when I fly
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might just bring a little tiny bit and
try to give most of it away where I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's harder to figure out in
Portland that you're landing in New York
[SPEAKER_02]: and you shouldn't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just see that you got a card and say,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they don't determine where you're
going to right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went before with the law first went into
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a TSA guy tell me, well,
where are you flying to?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm flying to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Hawaii card too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he said, you're not going to be
legal when you land there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, well, here's my Hawaii card.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're not going to be legal when
you're flying between here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's over the open ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're not going to be able to arrest
any.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he finally let me go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But since then, TSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That falls in 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been carrying my volcano on every
flight for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Waves?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The initiative says that the commission
will be appointed by the governor.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first seven people will be appointed
by the governor no later than New Year's
[SPEAKER_04]: Eve.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have them nominate seven people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it says that the commission will
start accepting license applications by
[SPEAKER_04]: February 28.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can try to get a crop in the ground
this year, next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you'll simply apply.
[SPEAKER_04]: The commission will create new rules
through the administrative rule process.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fast tracked.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we pass it, I expect I'll be one of the
commissioners.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll be trying to maintain the
integrity of the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'll be six other people on the
commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure who all they'll be.
[SPEAKER_04]: The governor will appoint them this first
time around.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some concern about the
composition of the commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the last things I changed in the
initiative was the composition of the
[SPEAKER_04]: commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: The initiative is just gonna have the
governor appoint them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that's actually had some blowback
because that's been one of the most
[SPEAKER_04]: contentious issues when you look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I changed it at the last minute before
filing it to have five members that are
[SPEAKER_04]: selected and then an election by growers
and processors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So growers and processors will elect five
members of the commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then two will be named by the
governor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to all agricultural
commissions in the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an agricultural commission law
that says 70% of the agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: commission has to be people in the
industry, the affected industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the media has picked up on that and
said we're gonna have the growers and
[SPEAKER_04]: processors running it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once again, we're all gonna go to hell
in a handbasket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, MCI, are you getting kicked back
from even people in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: patients, specifically patient-centered
organizations that are saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, why aren't patients on this panel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that part of it as well or is it just
that they just want law enforcement on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first it'll be named by the
government.
[SPEAKER_04]: The medical thing, you know, it's not a
medical-only initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for complete, full transformation of
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll change the whole dynamic.
[SPEAKER_04]: When patients don't have to pay for a
license and don't have an artificial limit
[SPEAKER_04]: on the amount they can grow and a doctor
can recommend it for anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know many people after that
that'll be getting an OMMP card.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you need it if you can grow your
own without a license?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why limit yourself to the 12.6 standard,
the 18 plants and pound and a half when
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no limit on the amount you can
grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, our initiative says the seeds and
starts of all strains of cannabis will be
[SPEAKER_04]: considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the horticulture market for cannabis
will be wide open.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to go to any horticulture
place, any garden store, Fred Meyer even,
[SPEAKER_04]: and buy your marijuana plants right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legally, that would technically be,
legally be up to those businesses to
[SPEAKER_04]: decide what they want to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the bees like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but does it, I was going to say,
is it, well, go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the question?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 30 days or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the end?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we don't, we don't, we say that
the commission will set the rules and
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations necessary to carry out its
duties.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I'm there and have anything to do
with it, it's going to be 30 days or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's no reason it should take
longer than 30 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of like a driver's
license.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't take a month to get a driver's
license.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why the OMMA takes six months
or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you have not violated this new
law, the old laws won't have any impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're like me and you're a marijuana
felon, that won't stop you at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to get a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only will be if you violate this new
law, then your access to the licenses will
[SPEAKER_04]: be restricted.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we don't set up the actual way
waves.
[SPEAKER_04]: We say that it'll be set up by the
commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's already long enough,
really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that patients, if they want to
remain protected, it might not just be a
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a little bit longer than a
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to wait until you have a legal
store to go buy it from, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it's enjoined in the courts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the dispensaries that are just
serving patients will be legal because
[SPEAKER_04]: that doesn't conflict with the
international treaties at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the horticultural use does not
conflict.
[SPEAKER_04]: The international treaties say that
cannabis can still be cultivated for
[SPEAKER_04]: horticulture and for a hemp fuel,
fiber and food and medicine, and that the
[SPEAKER_04]: parties don't have to prohibit this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll immediately free it for all of
those uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that won't be regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll only be if you want to get a license
and sell it for non-medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that would be the reason you'd have
to get one of these new OCC licenses,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon Cannabis Prohibition License.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to take one more question?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or more?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of confused about the whole
international treaty and what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: telling us we had to do and what,
like, we're trying to abide by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's this guy who really came up
and spearheaded marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a Harry Anslinger.
[SPEAKER_04]: His wife was the niece of Andrew Mellon,
who was a bigwig in steel and in oil and
[SPEAKER_04]: all of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the petrochemical industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he spearheaded it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he came up after getting marijuana
illegal in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came up with this treaty idea that he
spearheaded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a single convention treaty that
mandates that marijuana be a schedule one
[SPEAKER_04]: drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that treaty is in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we tried to write our initiative to be
in as close compliance with it as
[SPEAKER_04]: possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: In section one of our initiative,
it says this is a scientific act by the
[SPEAKER_04]: people of the state of Oregon to lower the
misuse and abuse of cannabis and stop the
[SPEAKER_04]: diversion to minors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that sentence is in there
specifically to add more compliance to the
[SPEAKER_04]: single convention treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's something that I look forward to
the day it's removed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll take the oldest agricultural crop,
the first crop purposely grown by humans,
[SPEAKER_04]: a plant that makes more fuel, more fiber,
more food, more medicine, and any other
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, and they're going to make that one
illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_04]: transnational, corporate, elite fascist
sons of bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Careful, you're sounding like Michael
Moore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that's a quote from a good old
friend of mine who passed away in January.
[SPEAKER_04]: He introduced me to Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the guy who drove around Kentucky,
I was talking about, in a hip-powered car
[SPEAKER_04]: back in October of 1990.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had another really good line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my father was on a PT boat,
World War II.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he fought the fascists to stop the
Japanese.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other friends of ours, like Dr. Philip
Levesque, he crossed the Rhine under fire
[SPEAKER_04]: from the Nazis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two-thirds of his platoon were killed
as they were crossing the Rhine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he arrested 26 soldiers, officers,
Nazi officers at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they didn't fight the fascists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would have to pee in a jar for a
job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's another one of those
Gable-Galbraith lines I'm pleased to carry
[SPEAKER_02]: on with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: He says hemp is not regulated under this
treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says it's free for hemp and for
medicine and for horticultural purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that part can be implemented
immediately and isn't in conflict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now there's no legal source.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, if there was a legal source of
cannabis, technically here in Oregon under
[SPEAKER_04]: Schedule II, it could be sold through
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that if Okta passed,
that this would be the first true
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization law passed in the last 41
years since the war on drugs started?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the last ever, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because marijuana was wild and free until
the first marijuana laws went into place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was back, I guess the first one
was 1914 in San Antonio.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, El Paso, in El Paso, Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the federal government passed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the states passing it,
making the federal government follow suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this just goes to show you,
we can turn it around in the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, alcohol prohibition was overturned
the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Oregon passed an initiative to
remove all the penalties and legalize the
[SPEAKER_04]: sale of alcohol in 1932.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the feds didn't do it until 1933.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state of New York passed it and took
all the laws off alcohol sale and
[SPEAKER_04]: production in 1923.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 1927.
[SPEAKER_04]: The states will lead, the feds will
follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: As everybody knows, we've got two other
initiatives in two other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Washington, Colorado, they tried in
Ohio and a couple other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michigan, Missouri.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't quite happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got legalization initiatives for
the people to vote on in three states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure you support all of them
because this is going to make it an even
[SPEAKER_02]: larger mandate, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just came from the Seattle Hip Fest last
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of people talking bad
about I-502 there because of certain
[SPEAKER_04]: provisions in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're one of those guys
locked up in prison for life without the
[SPEAKER_04]: possibility of parole, or one of those
poor souls in Malaysia about to be hung
[SPEAKER_04]: for possessing 200 grams or more
marijuana, and you hear it failed because
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody didn't like the fact they'd make
a little bit less money on it,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's evil in my book.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to free it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I support all of them and
unequivocally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like all the provisions in Prop
19 in California, but I supported that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not going to quibble with the
folks in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they make it legal for an adult to
possess an ounce, they make it legal for
[SPEAKER_04]: an adult to buy an ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a step forward in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some might ask, why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: As you said earlier, the old man may go
away and you have these clinics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in a way I am, but I am also a big
believer that you got to embrace change.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think you're going to do the same
thing you're doing today, next week,
[SPEAKER_04]: next month, next year, 10 years from now,
at some point you're going to be really
[SPEAKER_04]: sadly disappointed because the world's
changing and it's going to change faster
[SPEAKER_04]: and faster in the near future.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really believe that marijuana is a
bellwether issue for the future of freedom
[SPEAKER_04]: and that it's really about freedom of
thought and freedom of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now freedom is under attack.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they say corporations have more
rights than human beings in the Citizens
[SPEAKER_04]: United ruling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, in the near future we're
going to see an exponential growth in
[SPEAKER_04]: biological technology, genetics and
genomic science, an exponential growth in
[SPEAKER_04]: convergence with nanotechnology,
miniaturization of machines and processes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and an exponential growth in artificial
intelligence and that those will all merge
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't establish a natural
individual's right to think the thoughts
[SPEAKER_04]: we want to think, to experience the
consciousness we want to experience,
[SPEAKER_04]: the dystopian possibilities in the future
are grim.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, things like the Terminator,
the Matrix, those all come into the realm
[SPEAKER_04]: of reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to expand naturally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Natural individual rights and marijuana is
a bellwether and a start of that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we have to have a right to privacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to make sure that natural
individuals have more rights than
[SPEAKER_04]: artificial ones like corporations and in
the future, artificial intelligence.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is about freedom and the future
of freedom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think marijuana is a bellwether
issue that few people see.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they've used marijuana laws
against the activists in the 50s and 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were working to stop the wars and
it's really about freedom.
