[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to Scott herb thrasher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's put on a lot of work here This is all
his work today and with some help from
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers and also he is the director of
the Portland normal which is The
[SPEAKER_00]: organization in this state that is for
consumers and that's a voice that often
[SPEAKER_00]: gets lost especially these days with
so-called legalization in this state I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally have didn't have much of a
speech plan because I spent the last three
[SPEAKER_00]: months my life wasted on a Swindler who
was going to invest in me But that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we have now these days is these sharks
circling these people who haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in cannabis at all and don't
really care about the plant are now
[SPEAKER_00]: circling to try to make money and so I
just want everybody to be conscious of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and aware of it and and aware of who
you support when you do buy products and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's people who really do care about
this plant I as He said I've been involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually moved here a year and a half
ago Because I fell in love with a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: down here, but I've been a cannabis
activist in Washington State since 1995
[SPEAKER_00]: and You know what's happening up there is
not pretty and it's you know so called
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization But you know who thinks this
is legal do we think this is legal because
[SPEAKER_00]: the feds certainly don't the feds think
you're all criminals still and they the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that our Regulations are so ugly is
because of the feds up in Washington It's
[SPEAKER_00]: like they treat it like plutonium or
something when it's a plant that helps
[SPEAKER_00]: people I actually had a friend contact me
this morning Who said that he had a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Tacoma who had a five-year-old who
has a serious illness and really needs
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, and he's actually calling this
isn't a state that's supposedly legal and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go to the store and buy it and he
can't find They can't find help for their
[SPEAKER_00]: five-year-old and that's what's sad is
that it used to be easier to help children
[SPEAKER_00]: but with all the Regulations that are
getting piled on people and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just getting rid of medical the
troop Growers aren't there anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can't find these products that
actually help people so down here I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually had the fortunate The fortune to
spend some time down in Applegate Valley
[SPEAKER_00]: last few days With some just incredible
growers who put a lot of time and energy
[SPEAKER_00]: into making extracts that they can give to
people with with cancer and children and
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me a story about a friend whose
dad had they've been getting Oil to for
[SPEAKER_00]: free and the doctor said I don't know what
you're doing, but keep doing it So we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that it works and these are people that
you know the state and the feds would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to run out of the business So that they
can put more and more regulations on this
[SPEAKER_00]: and track where every single seed and
plant goes Because God forbid that it get
[SPEAKER_00]: out to people that we share it So it's so
crucial that we keep home grows And then
[SPEAKER_00]: we keep medical gardens because these are
people who are trying to get genetics out
[SPEAKER_00]: to people the genetics that help people
instead of just trying to get the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and And they're the people that can be
shut out because they don't have the money
[SPEAKER_00]: that it takes to follow these regulations
They're really expensive everybody wants
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap pot But it costs a lot of money
these when you're when you've got so many
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulations on you have to you have to buy
this expensive software put tags on every
[SPEAKER_00]: plant Pay all these ridiculous taxes 280
doesn't allow businesses to deduct
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses at the federal level the federal
the feds Are taking let half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: profits from people so it's really
expensive to get in so this fight is not
[SPEAKER_00]: over While you're here Walk around all the
booths and sign up for things it's okay to
[SPEAKER_00]: sign up for all of them There's a lot of
groups out there, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of groups You
know people talk about oh we all need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get together on one under one umbrella And
that's fine if you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: commonalities, but there's there's so many
issues out there I wrote I was thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about all these there's let's see there's
smoking lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's county bans There's 280e there's
edible limits over regulation pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients small growers there's so many
issues to focus on and All the different
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations kind of have a different
niche So be part of it sign up for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: lists, and if there's one that really
speaks to you get active get involved
[SPEAKER_00]: because this fight isn't Over and and we
get complacent when we think it's legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not there's still people serving
life in prison for pot and even when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're it is legal and it seems Like it's
a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we can all come out here and smoke pot
together, but behind the scenes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry there's Regulations going on that
that don't help they actually hurt you
[SPEAKER_00]: know all these cups that we enjoy going to
this is just one example and Actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon's doing a much better the job Than
Washington I'll tell you that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one of the regulations In Oregon is
that you know these the people who get a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational license?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can only give samples to other people with
recreational license in order to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it that means that when a cup comes
along next year a Recreational grower
[SPEAKER_00]: can't give a sample to the cup that it's
not legal They'd have to actually go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and buy it to submit it to a cup
and I brought that up to the OLCC And they
[SPEAKER_00]: they claim that that's not what they
intend to do so maybe we'll see some
[SPEAKER_00]: changes But it's little things like that
that they're just so concerned with
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking every bit because it might get
leaked out God forbid somewhere and They
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think about like the actual effect
on the industry the people who've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: this so long and know what's best for the
plant and for patients and They're worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about it might go to another state well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what if it's Going to other
states at least they're not getting it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico right, so there isn't that horrible
You know that hopefully we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue the fight to legalize it
federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the number one thing right now
I think and so Like I said go around sign
[SPEAKER_00]: up Thank you so much for coming remember
Seattle Hemfest third weekend of August
[SPEAKER_00]: largest Cannabis protestable in the world
and we'd love to see you all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again Scott
