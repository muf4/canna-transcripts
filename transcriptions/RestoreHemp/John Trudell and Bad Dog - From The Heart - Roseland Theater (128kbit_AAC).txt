There
[SPEAKER_00]: are times I turned out crooked And times I
turned on doubt There are times I just
[SPEAKER_00]: kept trying And times I just went without
There are times I felt like screaming And
[SPEAKER_00]: times I probably did There are times I
can't quite remember And times I can never
[SPEAKER_00]: forget There are times love is a shadow
And times love is a chain There are times
[SPEAKER_00]: love is the light And times love is to
blame
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times when a smile is a smile
And times when it is not There are times
[SPEAKER_00]: time buys And times times buy There are
times I went way out there And times I
[SPEAKER_00]: never came back There are times of great
feeling And times I don't feel a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times love is a shadow And times
love is a chain There are times love is
[SPEAKER_00]: the light And times love is to blame There
[SPEAKER_00]: are times I keep waiting for And times
that are never going to come There are
[SPEAKER_00]: times I could have done different And
times different isn't there There are
[SPEAKER_00]: times the balance is balance And times the
rush is too intense There are times it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all I can do to live And times I'm glad
that I do There are times love is a shadow
And times love is to blame There are times
time buys
