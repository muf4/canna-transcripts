[SPEAKER_00]: We had about 200,000 people in the march
asking for marijuana liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people completely lost their fear for
law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of in a complete civil
disobedience concerning planting the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are also happening there in
Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government has also announced that
they are looking to Uruguay as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are very respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the Uruguayan government,
what they did this year that was
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing cannabis for recreational
purposes and sales over the counter and
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is happening in this small,
tiny country called Uruguay, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounded by two big monsters,
which is Brazil and Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that the impact that Colorado
and Washington brought to South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: also Uruguay, will impact their next-door
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this green tsunami will not stop
because this is a green tsunami that
[SPEAKER_00]: already started here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you all for all this
big effort that all these years you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: have done as an example for the rest of
the world, this culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some of your culture over there to
teach these people all the benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only for using for recreational
purposes, from a harm reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, but also what it means for
industrial purposes, all the jobs it can
[SPEAKER_00]: create, and how ecological it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis is basically ecological.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need no chemicals to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than all the pharmaceuticals
and all the petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I want to encourage you guys to
go and vote in November for Prop 91,
[SPEAKER_00]: because as we are now, after Colorado,
Washington, South America is also going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a worldwide process,
and you guys can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a huge impact if you pass this
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to encourage all of you to take
your friends and go and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: To vote is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some of our countries, like Argentina
and Chile, we had these mean, mean
[SPEAKER_00]: militants who kidnapped a whole generation
of us, and now we're able to vote again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes democracy is a lie, but it's a
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can use it in the correct form,
it will be a benefit for all of us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
