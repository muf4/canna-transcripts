[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Erin purchase, and I am
speaking on behalf of the grow mama
[SPEAKER_00]: project and the pediatric patients of
Oregon They are the forgotten ones as
[SPEAKER_00]: money starts rolling in and taxes start
coming in and What we voted for gets not
[SPEAKER_00]: listened to and regulation hits the Oregon
medical marijuana program Several children
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up without a grower without access
to medications because of the limitations
[SPEAKER_00]: They have imposed on our program This is
not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most vulnerable group of
patients on our program and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: people have forgotten them in 2012 my
daughter was diagnosed with cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I treated it with cannabis oil last
week I was told by the oncologist She has
[SPEAKER_00]: a better chance of not relapsing than
every other child on their program because
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to use cannabis oil instead of
radiation instead of high dose chemo My
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter has survived a year past
treatments making her chance of relapse go
[SPEAKER_00]: down even further This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is progressive medicine there has not
been medicine coming out for childhood
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer in 50 years We need research We did
not legalize recreational cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: forget about the medical program we
legalized it to Make research happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the way that the general Public
thinks about cannabis we did not legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it so a bunch of people could go
party with pot I mean granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun, and I do it too, but when it
comes down to it the patients on this
[SPEAKER_00]: program or what matter and The regulations
that they have imposed are taking medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the hands of patients To grow 12
plants in city limits makes hardly any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil You cannot supply six
patients on 12 plants My daughter took
[SPEAKER_00]: three grams a day for two years through
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it required I Think it would
take two at least two maybe four cards to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover that on a monthly basis and now I
can only grow for two patients me and her
[SPEAKER_00]: which means I think six to eight of our
patients I can't remember exactly how many
[SPEAKER_00]: we had have lost their grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lost their medicine and most of those
were children They are now Forced to go
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere find other medicine Another
thing that that's a big problem is we have
[SPEAKER_00]: it easy here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have hundreds of dispensaries We need
to use our voices for the people on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side of the state I come from
Eastern, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a place where Dispensaries are
completely forbidden this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a dying cancer patient who was
completely ripped off she bought a $250
[SPEAKER_00]: jar of glycerin tincture with I don't even
Think it had cannabis in it that is
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous and that could be prevented but
these legislators are preventing that from
[SPEAKER_00]: happening We need to get to this capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you all don't get paid to do
it It's very hard to drive all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but it's much harder to drive from
the eastern side of the state Let's get to
[SPEAKER_00]: these people talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just speak for yourself Please keep
in mind the patients clear across Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: the most vulnerable patients that are too
sick and Dying to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to use our voice for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a patient too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sick, but I'm able to be here I'm able
to write emails if you're able to if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're please just do it our children The
dying patients the sick patients the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that can't come they matter and
they matter a lot So please just use your
[SPEAKER_00]: voice go get those emails schedule
appointments Tell everyone you know about
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical benefits of this plant because
that Cannot be forgotten as we go forth
[SPEAKER_00]: with setting up our recreational market,
which I am very happy that Nobody you know
[SPEAKER_00]: has to go to prison for just smoking a
joint anymore on the side of the street or
[SPEAKER_00]: something That's amazing, but we also need
to make sure that our medical patients
[SPEAKER_00]: Retain the rights that they've always had
maybe even get more rights instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: taking away their medicine Let's make it
easier for them to get more affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it covered under insurance the
Oregon health plan I Can't even get my
[SPEAKER_00]: state I go to a state county or the county
health health department clinic for my
[SPEAKER_00]: regular doctor I get treated like crap for
being a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even get anything treated because
I use cannabis nothing They won't even
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe me medicine not only that I have
to sign a contract for them that they
[SPEAKER_00]: won't give me anything But do you think
they'll sign my medical marijuana card?
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely not and They will make it known
that they don't support it that they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see any benefit and oh matter of Fact all
your health problems are probably because
[SPEAKER_00]: you use it That's not right This cannabis
has taken me off of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals it replaced a lot of
Pharmaceuticals that my daughter did not
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have they are lying to us and we
need to gain the support of everybody So
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can take control of our program
take control of our market and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: what we want it to be Thank you
