[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine I was there the
Attorney General Ferguson was there with
[SPEAKER_01]: the keynote speaker to open up the
conference and everybody had excited the
[SPEAKER_01]: next day So I took a few minutes to speak
to the group and said well, I know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrated and disappointed but not
shocked So I think it could have been a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot worse They could have not only
rescinded the cold memorandum,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they could have replaced it and told
the US states to move forward in closing
[SPEAKER_01]: down the businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be totally honest with you,
not sure to rescind the memo, but we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been waiting for the Obama, I'm sorry,
for the Trump administration to give us
[SPEAKER_01]: some guidance around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I basically say stay calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Attorney General and our governor and
several legislators from both parties had
[SPEAKER_01]: a press conference the next day stating
that they would defend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to understand that
Sessions said he gives more authority and
[SPEAKER_00]: power to the state's District Attorneys
and thus far State of Washington's
[SPEAKER_00]: District Attorney supportive, supporting
the state and their rollout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well to be honest with you, for years we
just haven't had much of a communication
[SPEAKER_01]: because we used the cold memorandum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really I think like our states and
others we're reaching out to our acting US
[SPEAKER_01]: Attorneys because we don't have appointees
of the new administration right now to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: down with them and walk through the story
that we've given to our congressional
[SPEAKER_01]: delegation that we met with last year and
then we're also meeting with in the next
[SPEAKER_01]: couple months to talk about help that they
can give us with respect to the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we continue to now reach out to those
US Attorneys just like many of the states
[SPEAKER_01]: like Oregon is to make sure we have that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright Steve, Billy, where are the
combos?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so first, you know, the cold memo
went away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see a change in our policies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the provisions of the cold memo
are enshrined in Oregon law.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our sets of regulations, so clearly
that's still going to be a focal point for
[SPEAKER_02]: our regulatory structure here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that we've worked on
enforcement now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had criminal activity and we've
already coordinated with law enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: and the US Attorney's Office along the way
on those big cases that involve criminal
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see a change in the focus of the
US Attorney on criminal activity,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the summit is very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me because he's taking the time to get
educated about what's happening on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's interested to learn in areas
that they haven't had much experience with
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't know what they were doing as
well under with the lack of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: decision making on precision and direction
from the Trump administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I think they've got some autonomy
within each region to take a look at
[SPEAKER_02]: what's happening and I very much
appreciate the approach that the US
[SPEAKER_02]: Attorney is taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the summit is going to be a good
thing for the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got great educational
opportunity there, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not going to lose their focus on
going after criminal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in your conversations thus far,
the focus has remained if you're diverting
[SPEAKER_00]: product to the illegal market or if you're
just plain operating on the illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're being legal, if you're following
the rules and you're being compliant with
[SPEAKER_00]: CD sale tracking, the old CC framework,
nothing has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No focus change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't change anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: No focus change there, but I think you all
read his editorial where he was focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: how much supply we're generating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just his problem, problem for all of
us in this industry right now about how
[SPEAKER_02]: that plus supply is going to be consumed,
what happens with the economics,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the pressure is on for diversion from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I hear as a licensee is if you
grew it in the legal market, if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: tracked in the legal market, if you're a
legal licensee, the focus will,
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst thing that we could do as an
industry is take product that was produced
[SPEAKER_00]: legally and diverted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people that are doing that should
expect to have penalties as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's against a lot, but people that are
keeping it inside the market, there might
[SPEAKER_00]: be price reductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be product that goes bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of things could happen to that,
but we as an industry need to give
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence to the OCC as well as use to
district attorney that product that's
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the market will be dealt with
appropriately and it won't be diverted
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the worst thing that we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of bad actors could change the
focus, uh, to the industry that is legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we all have our addresses and phone
numbers and contact information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier for them to find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything we can do to be better at
that is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you, you addressed, let me just
follow up on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of getting on the
downside of the industry right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, there's welcome in what's
welcoming as we were at bringing people in
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting them into the system and
trying to make the licensing process as
[SPEAKER_02]: penetrable as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the flip sides of that is we're
going to have to help you when you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: unwind.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you decide you need to get out of the
business and figure out ways to get those
[SPEAKER_02]: inventories down and how we can help you
get to that point to make it easier to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn in your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to, if you're at that point,
we're here at the tipping scale and you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to get out and have this product in
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to help you get that product out
of your business and into places in our
[SPEAKER_02]: legal system where it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've had companies that have,
uh, you know, uh, destroyed their product
[SPEAKER_02]: just to get out cleanly right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that epic about the system and
not taking the product and skipping it
[SPEAKER_02]: elsewhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, we want to work on that too,
just to make sure that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you do online, that you can do so
readily when for those that need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells me to something that
happened that Ricky mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe someone has heard about minor
decoys.
[SPEAKER_00]: System from a compliance checks that we've
done in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out, uh, minor decoys system for
everybody that knows is someone goes out
[SPEAKER_00]: that's under 21 tries to purchase product
from a licensed retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an ID that says they're under
21.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a big red box on it in Oregon says
I'm under 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not trying to trick anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they really crafty fake IDs with guys
with long beards looking like they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 35 and it's no, it looks like a
child with an ID that says I am a child
[SPEAKER_00]: under 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we didn't do so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Ricky said that was, that's to be
expected to some degree for a very new
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is one of the things if we as an
industry fail that continuously is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to draw a lot of undue attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rick, can you speak to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How that went to Washington?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys had to start, how long did it
take you to really start doing those kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of minor decoys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do them now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we do at least three to four visits
a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we initially did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw the same results because no one had
ever done compliance checks for these
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of made sense in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a vertical ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're 21, it's a horizontal ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't really hard to know that
you're looking at a piece of ID that says
[SPEAKER_01]: the individual is likely to be under 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, just for the experience of it,
it didn't take long for the industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that this is problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to make sure we go right back
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a, if there's a sale,
we'll be back in with it three months to
[SPEAKER_01]: see if folks have learned how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times it means we're doing
training again with the employees there to
[SPEAKER_01]: help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wasn't really surprised to see the
numbers though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw, I read the reports that people were
very concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they should be concerned,
but you should understand maybe 50 or 60%
[SPEAKER_01]: would have been alarming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were still high even for the first
compliance checks you'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what I keep telling Steve
because that was our experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the experience of the other,
of the other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick's been through it, but I'm not as
ready to forgive or forget or not to
[SPEAKER_02]: follow through.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in that stage of compliance now
where you've got to perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you there's nothing been,
there has been nothing more damaging than
[SPEAKER_02]: that poor report on the minor ID checks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your friends in government are really,
really disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had pockets that were well below
50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland metropolitan area was a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to get that together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a color, you know,
coloring around the box and the picture
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a visual thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just lack of training,
lack of willingness to follow through.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we started this,
we wanted to do ID checking at the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a bill and that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, you know, no one under 21 or 18,
if you got a medical card, could get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have helped with your
compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have help that we can give you to
get into compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to help you be in compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't tell you how much immediate
pressure that I felt from the political
[SPEAKER_02]: leadership of the state when those
statistics came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like our penalty schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're very excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a case study for all of the
next things that are going to roll out for
[SPEAKER_02]: us because we really haven't done full
retail checking yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had those procedures in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're never going to get in the
labs really until maybe the tail end of
[SPEAKER_02]: this process when we're doing more
complete audits and inspections.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all those things are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've been good through the
boltons of telling you, expect this,
[SPEAKER_02]: expect that, get ready for this and laying
it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've sent out to our boltons
before the December minor decoy checks,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came and we didn't do so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know we're going to get better,
but I'm frustrated by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were ahead of the game in
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our commission is going to be
considering some actions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they'll take,
but they're disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a chance to talk last night and
it was very apparent at both Rick and
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve that your intentions are to help the
industry be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not to say gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big deal as a licensee that's
coming in the OCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: WLCB are coming in to actually help us
maintain compliance to keep focus off the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated industry, undo focus off the
regulated industry and help us be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is important, extremely
important that everyone's compliant and
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys and your agencies are doing
everything you can to help and willing to
[SPEAKER_02]: help in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the real human consequence
of not having that training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the worker has a worker permit and
you know, they're potentially going to
[SPEAKER_02]: lose that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get fired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a bunch of those that failed
fired their workers and failed to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: check.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say whether that's right or
wrong and the alcohol side, we go through
[SPEAKER_02]: that and it's, you know, whether there's
remedial training and that's what we
[SPEAKER_02]: should be, but you guys schedule one drug,
we're rolling out a new system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the simplest of things to make
happen right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there was, there was some
surprise when we began our first
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance checks and we talked about it
last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually sent letters to all the
retailers telling them we were coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did press releases to the media
and said, we're coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because we want voluntary
compliance, we're not there to stick the
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want you to make sure you're
checking ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably had something to do,
but I think Oregon did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to your point, I think we're trying to
get voluntary compliance without having to
[SPEAKER_01]: write violations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, your agency exists and gets
money when the industry is successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing and thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a theme that I always get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to tell everybody, I get a
public forum to do it is the OCC and the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor control board in Washington is here
to support the industry and help them move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward the best that it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's rules and guidelines that we
all need to follow because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of brings me to my next
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think there's too much product
in Oregon right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could cause some concern, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm imagining outside of the minor decoy,
there's going to be increased compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: checks on where that product goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it enters into the metric system,
it's legal, it's grown, produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it end up?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next worst thing that could happen
outside of selling to minors is a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: legal product in Kansas that was produced
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rick, I mean, what did you guys do
originally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see that much of an issue of
overproduction early on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course not, because we learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's back to this gold rush
mentality that occurred five years ago as
[SPEAKER_01]: it did in most of the states with
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people recognize how bumpy
the ride would be and how it continues to
[SPEAKER_01]: be bumpy given that you've got this
violation of federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you create a system that's so
restrictive and I recognize so expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have the same issue that we're
having right now in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did initially because we started
with the producer licenses in March and we
[SPEAKER_01]: issued retail licenses in July.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an undersupply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did we learn from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have given at least six months
to nine months before we opened our first
[SPEAKER_01]: retail shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I suspect there was an oversupply in
Oregon and Washington before legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I bring that up is
remember, it takes time to move toward a
[SPEAKER_01]: legal marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have illegal grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have oversupply of the
system as you come to realize and
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the supply and demand for that
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very difficult for us to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the same cry as you in
Washington right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an oversupply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually reached out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, when we began, we knew nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spent, that was a group of 25 in
Washington, 25 in Colorado that met once
[SPEAKER_01]: every two weeks for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned everything that we could from
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we hired Dr. Mark Kleinman,
Dr. Bo Kilmer with the Rand Corporation,
[SPEAKER_01]: Botech, Angela Hopkins and Jonathan
Cockens.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people that are known all over
the country as experts in drug policy
[SPEAKER_01]: around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hired them and subcontracted them to
help us understand they actually surveyed
[SPEAKER_01]: by city and county and our state what is
the consumption rate for cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: folks over 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we built our system to try to
make sure that we weren't diverting or
[SPEAKER_01]: oversupply in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was bumpy to begin with,
but we would have never thought after
[SPEAKER_01]: three years, so three and a half years of
retail, our first year, 250 million in
[SPEAKER_01]: sales, our second year, 800 million in
sales, last year, 1.3 billion in sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: 700 million in sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: A million in excise taxes being collected
for the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you an example, because as you
heard earlier, we were a control state for
[SPEAKER_01]: spirits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spirit sales in 2011 were about 800
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis sales in Washington are 1.3
billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And alcohol sales in Washington are about
3 billion a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see we never, in fact,
the estimates fiscally for how the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry would grow or what the revenue
was, was about a third to a half of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we've collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a robust, it's a big industry in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think finally, because we've ended,
look how long it's taken, we've ended the
[SPEAKER_01]: allowance for new licenses for producers,
processors, and retailers that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually starting to stabilize as far as
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear two things with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of tax revenue builds a confidence
in the state to keep that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tax revenue is put to work in a lot
of great ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quick question for you, do you see
Washington opening up its canopy limits
[SPEAKER_00]: and or allowing out of state in the near
future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't see us opening canopy
because there's so much concern in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington this year that there's too much
canopy, that the price of cannabis is now
[SPEAKER_01]: really close to what you showed me this
morning, Steve, as far as about a $6
[SPEAKER_01]: average per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hearing the same concerns in
Oregon that I'm hearing in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't suspect we're going to open up
the canopy at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Steve, your turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the number of licenses,
what's the OCC's perspective on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you let it figure itself out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you cap it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: The OCC doesn't have a definitive position
on caps versus letting the market run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally think we were set up as
open market qualifications based.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should deal with it on that
basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a bit messier for the agency
and enforcement deal, because we could
[SPEAKER_02]: surely button it up and make a nice
recreational medical consumer market
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the OCC with caps and restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Policymakers are going to think about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's an equitable debate
there about which way the state could go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly would be a quick,
easy solution, but cap on the word you put
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are you going to take in just
those people who got into the moratorium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to put in all those folks
that have submitted a license or the
[SPEAKER_02]: $3,000 in the queue and give them an
opportunity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to extend it to these folks
that have declared an OHA that it would
[SPEAKER_02]: come up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably that number gets large enough
that it's meeting with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the politics drive us to a
larger number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure the caps will be effective
even if we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your stance, you're leaning towards it,
not making sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously cap it and let the market figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an OCC position.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that Washington does,
it's data to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, this is their first year,
first major year of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And data is incredibly helpful for us as
we're trying to build our business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Washington releases a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon is starting to release data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That data would allow the industry to
analyze the amount of product that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced and make strategic business
decisions based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see Oregon moving in a direction
where they're like, we want to release as
[SPEAKER_00]: much data as possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we reasonably expect?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we're going to move in the realm
of more transparency with our data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting better at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The data is starting to clean up some too
because it was not very meaningful,
[SPEAKER_02]: still not entirely meaningful what we have
in the system yet today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope that we move in that direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our new chairman, Paul Rosenbaum,
actually has an experience with a little
[SPEAKER_02]: company that's nationwide that grint-track
that monitors all of your viewing on
[SPEAKER_02]: set-top boxes on TV, understands data
really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think he needs some time to get in
and experience what he thinks we should be
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of a data producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we're going to get there and
put more and more and more data out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that you see that in the coming
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we're going to jump suddenly
and do a lot of things because I think we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to work with somebody in part,
work with other states right now because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some parameters as we share data,
how we define it, how we look at it that
[SPEAKER_02]: are really helping us think about
establishing the long-term parameters for
[SPEAKER_02]: best practices and management of marijuana
in Oregon or across the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, in terms of what our standards
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't expect to see a lot of
changes immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, there are some things
we're required to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to put out a supply report.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do that before the 19th
session.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the indeterminate questions we
got about four million pounds of wet
[SPEAKER_02]: weight and maybe when it's dry,
383 pounds annually of dry weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are numbers that, these are
estimates that aren't certified estimates,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working through to figure out how we
use this and what's meaningful in the
[SPEAKER_02]: calculations that when we put out
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to have to report to the
legislature on the supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one thing the federal government is
interested in seeing us follow through and
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that confusing part between wet and
dry that's pretty confounding,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much is going to extracts,
how much extracts on extracts to edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a growing market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have new market entrants coming in in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: More and more medical folks are utilizing
our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the less retail on the
medical side, I think we're going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: some growth there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much of this can be consumed once
it's ultimate product next?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get a full cycle in the
coming year, which I think we'll have a
[SPEAKER_02]: good set of data to take a look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be able to see from fall harvest
to all the way through a good cycle of
[SPEAKER_02]: data, how all of that harvest translates
into products and supply in our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's kind of interesting that what
I've learned is our public disclosure laws
[SPEAKER_01]: are very different in the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Washington's referred to as a sunshine
law, which means there's not much is
[SPEAKER_01]: protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the reason why data is
available not only in the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with respect to our licensees,
enforcement violations that are issued,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that information is available on
our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure for a lot of the industry that's
concerning, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes us better understand and others
understand what our marketplace looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the restrictions,
I think Oregon's kind of in the other
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking to protect public
information in our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have much that we can do about
that other than provide that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as an example, that's one of the
reasons why we have that more successive
[SPEAKER_01]: banking is that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our retailers sign a waiver that allows
them, allows us to provide the licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: file to the banks, to the credit unions.
[SPEAKER_01]: By doing that, we've done a criminal
background check.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found out a financial investigation
where the money came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives or removes some of the anxiety
that the banking industry has in our state
[SPEAKER_01]: because we provide that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have the ability to ask for a
monthly report of any activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on with the licensing,
what's being reported through the
[SPEAKER_01]: traceability system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look at what's happening in the
account that they hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that particular licensee to make sure
that they can account for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest with you, I think that's
the biggest reason why we've had success
[SPEAKER_01]: in our state with banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like the industry in
Washington, it seems like in Oregon we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really opposed and we were going through
the data and what was public and what was
[SPEAKER_00]: not really, really, really opposed to it
because there is security risk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the state of Washington, the way that
you release the data, is the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: angry about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they'd be angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be concerned about it because you can
go into our system and find out exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: where our licensing address is,
for example, and I can go in there and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what your sales are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think everybody recognizes because
early on we shared that, there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: anything we can do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been a bunch of negative
repercussions because that data is out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state of Oregon, what are the laws
around it, you said the actual disclosure
[SPEAKER_00]: laws, what can you and can't you release
legally?
[SPEAKER_02]: The big primary thing is landowner name
affiliation with the property.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want that protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senator Porzanski got the names of
individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being able to keep records at retail
and individual sales as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we lost some data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say we're in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have to dispose a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ask us for the records,
we'll have to provide them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make an evaluation then about what box
needs to be checked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only ones we consider are security and
I'm not sure that I've seen us deny any
[SPEAKER_02]: particular information but landowner
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot available.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't put it out systemically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to start seeing more
dashboards and compilations of our
[SPEAKER_00]: movement through metric here in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about getting the infrastructure
set up and the ability to give data that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because dry weight is not meaning usable
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sticks, there's family,
everything goes through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of that actually is usable?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good data to get eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of prioritizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the OCC dealing with hemp getting
into the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about that for a couple
minutes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last year and a half, I haven't
seen, maybe a little less than that last
[SPEAKER_02]: year, in our final rule-making.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen many members of the
marijuana community end when we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the hemp folks in droves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want penetration to our retail
licensing market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started off saying they could and do
the packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: They expected to come in and then our
rules back off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our commission made a decision to let them
in without being in the metric tracking
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: New federal requirements were out there
around hemp and the human consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: New legislation was passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've let hemp come into our system
through processors as required by the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's legislation pending that would
allow the tracking of marijuana metric
[SPEAKER_02]: right off of the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: You designate your hemp coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be entered in the metric and it
would proceed through its track.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would entail also a clear
strain for hemp being very distinct from
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana inside our system, maybe its own
symbols, certainly its own packaging,
[SPEAKER_02]: and making it a separate strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gonna be a, this is a industry
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the competition, we've tended to favor
those that are paying for our system,
[SPEAKER_02]: the marijuana producers, the hemp
producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The marijuana producers have paid the
freight on our system and have imposed,
[SPEAKER_02]: who have met our security requirements on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp producers haven't had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's less dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's too much, but they have
access to a completely different market
[SPEAKER_02]: than our market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a, we've staked out one part of
the scope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the industry, the
legislature, everyone has a handle on how
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to come together in the
retail marketplace across the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just in our shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it's a difficult question to solve
and one fell swoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put a marker in, I think everyone's
pivoting off that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, it's gonna be an enforcement
problem for Oregon too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this whole grow issue is very
compounding with our growers of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_02]: whose grow is what and where and how much
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp can be exported.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are worried about diversion of
marijuana and the hemp exportation as a
[SPEAKER_02]: possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly a lot of bulk product,
looks the same, smells a lot the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's mixed for tough enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna be a tough issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one minute or less as we're wrapping
up, Washington's... So can I talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp for a minute?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't regulate hemp, the LCB,
it's Department of Ag, but I actually got
[SPEAKER_01]: a kick out of the fact how times are
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a shampoo from the Red Lion here
on the river and it says hemp and lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: shampoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't say 12% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't say 12% THC.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quick bullet point format.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the focus, you know, top three
focus for Washington?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you guys are gonna focus on over the
next 12 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is rules, session, legislation,
or is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a couple of rule changes that
we're looking at, packaging and labeling,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, pretty strict regulations
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking a look at that and coming out
in the next, probably next month with
[SPEAKER_01]: changes to that, make it a little easier
for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're, I mean, just it's
interesting that legislative day to day
[SPEAKER_01]: for the credit unions in Washington and
they're going up on the hill and one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the three big issues for them is continue
to have the state assistance in banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're watching that closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're continuing to work with
cities and counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have bans and moratorias in our state
and it was pretty problematic initially
[SPEAKER_01]: because the initiative didn't speak to
whether cities and counties could impose
[SPEAKER_01]: bans and moratorias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to the attorney general and
asked for an opinion and unfortunately the
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion was because the initiative was
silent on bans and moratorias,
[SPEAKER_01]: cities and counties, you can impose them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet at the same time they told the LCB,
because it was silent and someone meets
[SPEAKER_01]: the licensing requirements, which doesn't
have anything to do with bans or
[SPEAKER_01]: moratorias, you've got to issue a license
in the city and county.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a city and county imposes a ban on
moratoria, you can imagine how popular the
[SPEAKER_01]: state was when we issue licenses in cities
and counties that had bans and moratorias.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real frustration for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually we even would have supported
the ability for cities and counties to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to veto that because there was so
much consternation and people were so
[SPEAKER_01]: upset as far as cities and counties that
we would issue license and defiance of
[SPEAKER_01]: their bans and moratorias.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the legislature wouldn't move
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enforcement, training and compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in that mode now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to work with you as we go forward
in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have educational sections
on the new rules that have been adopted,
[SPEAKER_02]: changes you need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the legislative session,
there's deflating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily with our agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is a push and a need to look
at overall enforcement resources in the
[SPEAKER_02]: state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the governor and legislature are
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how they're going to finance
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't particularly think that all that
needs to be financed on the backs of our
[SPEAKER_02]: system or our fees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that some of that should perhaps come
out of the tax dollars we're generating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've stood up an industry with
you that at the end of this biennium and
[SPEAKER_02]: total is going to, from my startup to now,
is going to generate $210 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some dollars there to invest in
making the enforcement system better,
[SPEAKER_02]: to invest in making our services better,
which is another piece of the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get our licensing system
working better with renewals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're out in the trainings and
in clinics to make that happen quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't been renewed, get renewed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working on the services that we provide
you as well from an IT perspective is a
[SPEAKER_02]: big part of our next focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the better funding you guys can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoother the industry will be in the
regulation and the faster we can continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your assistance.
Thank you.
Thank you.
