[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, my attitude is we can complain
and blame the bad guys and we cry around a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about how they're not fair and things
like that, but that's who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just plain, simple reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think when I look at him,
specifically towards him, like they were
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning earlier about the California
Proposition 19, if that passes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's also inclusive of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of a major thing kind of
happening around that part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about the hemp thing, the only thing I
would add is the people that really are
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously environmentally oriented,
I think that there should be serious
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just at least check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's the whole reason it's
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, the reason hemp is illegal is
because marijuana was made illegal in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first place to shut down hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it was made illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went after hemp through marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now marijuana is starting to come
back in, so now bring hemp back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way they went after it,
let's bring it back in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the marijuana prohibition had
everything, it didn't have anything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with getting high on pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had everything to do with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting down the forest and the
petrochemical, now going to the oil stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this had fallen into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so I think people that are
seriously considering about being
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentalist, and I'm not challenging
anything they're doing, I'm just saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, if you're for real about the
environment, this is earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's renewable, it's earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just plain and simply is.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the medical marijuana people,
let's say, all right, well, we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicine for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's come back and get it for the
earth, because she's the one that's given
[SPEAKER_00]: us our medicine in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, I'm saying out of all of this,
and out of the hemp marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be the ones that show our
dedicated loyalty to the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp is, yeah, I mean, anyway,
it's productive, and it doesn't harm the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the chemicals, realities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps regenerate the soil.
