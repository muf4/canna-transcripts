[SPEAKER_00]: We're marching in conjunction with over a
million people around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over 400,000 people marching today
in Santiago, Chile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost 200,000 people today in Buenos
Aires, Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 in Toronto, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got some regulation of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our legislature's done a good job in
making some good changes, a few bad
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some good changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of people still going
to jail around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the global marijuana march.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need global marijuana freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so until we have that, we aren't going
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, marijuana prohibition was never
really about drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana prohibition was always about
money and power and the further
[SPEAKER_00]: centralization of economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And political control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana prohibition is really about
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really that we can drive our cars on
hemp fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will when we can grow high THC
cannabis without regard to its THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the varieties that produce the
best seeds and the most seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: over 400 gallons of hemp seed per acre
with a byproduct of four tons of high
[SPEAKER_00]: protein food.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 40 tons of fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can not only give the world clean
energy, we can wipe out world hunger with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed meal left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can stop deforestation with the
byproduct of fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can decentralize wealth by taking money
out of the hands of Exxon Mobil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Saudi Sheiks, the Nigerian despots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having all that money go into
their bank accounts in the Bahamas,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Caymans, the Swiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of it going there, it'll go into
our farmers' pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that money will enrich us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the main reason that marijuana
was prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about a battle between the
natural cycle and the synthetic cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people who brought us the lies
about marijuana, the misinformation
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign, are the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: transnational, corporate, elite,
fascist sons of bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we can restore hemp for fuel,
we will change our whole economic paradigm
[SPEAKER_00]: and reestablish freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom isn't just about speech,
assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also about consciousness and feeling
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp grows on trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be plentiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start growing hemp for fuel,
the whole world will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine will be cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our economy will decentralize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have a sustainable world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm marching today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for coming out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep working until we restore hemp.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yay!
