[SPEAKER_01]: You can't believe how advanced we are as
an independent ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Independent scares the bejesus out of the
powers that be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Independent means that they don't have any
power over you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't instill party partisanship.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are absolutely unaffiliated with
anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we want to do is what's right for the
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can set that template,
if we can show it can be done,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be a popular uprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be defeating money that's 10
times, 20 times what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your vote's not for sale,
it doesn't make any difference how much
[SPEAKER_01]: money the other side spends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the word is out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buzz is us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stake in employees, 38,000 people,
they hate the present governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The head of the union has already come to
us and said, hey, we're out there working
[SPEAKER_01]: for you right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came out against mountaintop removal,
an extremely ecologically destructive way
[SPEAKER_01]: of extracting coal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came out against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the only candidates against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the only running mate who's a
woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the only woman in the race.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 350,000 more women.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women vote in that race than men do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only need 450,000 votes to win this
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got the environmentalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the military.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an honorable discharge from the
Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell you, this present governor
who's going to have the Democratic
[SPEAKER_01]: nomination because he's an incumbent,
the other day, he did not go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: gathering at Fort Campbell where President
Obama came down to honor the Navy SEALs
[SPEAKER_01]: who took out Osama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our governor refused to go down with him
because he didn't want to have his picture
[SPEAKER_01]: taken with Obama.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he had to be talking with some
other business leaders in the state at
[SPEAKER_01]: that time so he couldn't afford to change
his schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought that wasn't a front to
every military person in the whole damn
[SPEAKER_01]: state, that he was too cowardly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want his picture taken with
Obama because Obama was roundly defeated
[SPEAKER_01]: in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there comes times when you've got to
set aside that kind of partisanship and
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise some common sense and pay homage
to brave people like those Navy SEALs who
[SPEAKER_01]: went in there and did something that I'm
sure a lot of us would like to have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's roundly, roundly, roundly
disgusted a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he is ready for a big downfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Republican is just, he's not going
to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Republican is toast already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an extremely weak field that
we're running against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ought to win this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can just put up a modicum of
credibility and responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like the NBA finals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your team might not be in the finals when
they may be half a continent away,
[SPEAKER_01]: but pay attention to them box scores there
in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be fun to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get a lot of international
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gatewood, we've got time for one more
little stump speech here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's show them your book and your website
and tell them how they can get in touch
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks, this book right here is called The
Last Free Man in America Meets a Synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: Subversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the number one seller at a major
market for 11 straight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an ex-governor says it's the best
statement of freedom in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's ever read.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fun book, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left out 100% of the sex and 80% of the
drugs, but it's still a kick-ass read.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go to gatewood.com to get our
political site.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that same spot, you can find out how to
get in touch with us and request a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be glad to send you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd appreciate a donation in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after I send you one, I'll be in
envelope with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me some money if you like the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's gatewood.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: People all over the world can contribute
to us, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have gotten contributions from out of
the country thus far.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a big dog, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus Christ, what was it going to take to
get you guys out here to get this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: done?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who are helping out the
marijuana policy project, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a couple of big donors of insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a big insurance company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he's going to put an initiative
for medical marijuana on the Ohio ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just came out the past few weeks and
said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, you couldn't put your money in any
more honorable place than to try to get
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana as a medicine in the hands of
the sick and dying people of the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States of America.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, just with that money, you could buy
relief from people who right now are
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering from chronic pain, from people
who suffer all day from chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could bring immediate relief to those
people with the proper application and
[SPEAKER_01]: direction of really a very small amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gatewood.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you how to bring relief
to hundreds of thousands of people and
[SPEAKER_01]: relief to your own soul because you'll
feel a lot better about yourself after you
[SPEAKER_01]: get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for coming to
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's have the honor of a present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
