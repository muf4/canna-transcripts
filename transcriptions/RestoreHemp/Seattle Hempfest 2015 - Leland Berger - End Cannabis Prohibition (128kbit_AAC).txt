[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a couple years after 502
and many of us have disagreements with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's too few of us to be divided.
[SPEAKER_00]: More love, less attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Seattle, can you give us some of
that, please?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can move forward together and finish
the work so that nobody gets fired from
[SPEAKER_00]: their job just because they're a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is denied housing just because
they're a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to end cannabicatry and the way to
do that is to come out of the closet,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to talk to people, is to let them know,
listen, I'm not a recreational marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a responsible adult consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like people consume alcohol
responsibly, I consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody be safe on your way home,
thanks.
