[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for HempFest,
for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: HempFest 2014 is really great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Krawitz, Executive Director,
Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here for the United States
Military Veterans in the House.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here for the US Military Veterans in
the House.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a, I guess I don't need to
tell you all, it's been a tough road for
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans dealing with the VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's of course where the veteran
gets a lot of healthcare assistance and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare benefits and treatment at the
VA hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it stops me in my tracks just
thinking about the horrendous outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've got mayhem out there as a
result of government programs gone awry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like I said, I don't really need
to tell you all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to give you an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, we've worked really hard at the
national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access is
involved in several different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with the VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that veterans can go into the VA
and not be harassed for using medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana outside the VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simple thing to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not asking for much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not be hassled for using medical
marijuana per state program when we go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the VA hospital and get the rest of
our treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully, as a result of our work,
many veterans across the country
[SPEAKER_00]: culminating in 2010 and being reissued in
2011, we do have a VA policy that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans to use medical marijuana in a
state program and not be harassed when
[SPEAKER_00]: they go into the VA hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we appreciate all the help from
everyone that helped us get that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're making sure that, you know,
ailments that veterans suffer from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there are ailments that everyone
might suffer from at one point or another
[SPEAKER_00]: in their life with some bad luck or just
maybe some age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, veterans maybe suffer from
these things at a little higher rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, statistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-traumatic stress, chronic pain,
traumatic brain injury, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working to try to make sure that
those things are covered under state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the VA has handed this off to
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're making sure that the states pick
up their end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right here in Washington State,
we're working on trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: post-traumatic stress added as a
qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important that we get this
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody out there that can help,
anybody that knows a legislator,
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that hasn't talked to their family
or friends about cannabis, for veterans
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we need to be able to have that
added into the state law, do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help us out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get that added into state law,
then you'll be able to go to the VA and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell them that I'm, you know,
participating in a state medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to, you know,
integrate that into your treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so everybody knows, you got to go to
the state doctor first, not the VA doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure everyone gets
that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does my heart good to be out
here with you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that a lot of people
come up here and they give you a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs to do, you know, write a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just telling you, tell your friends
and neighbors, you know, that's all well
[SPEAKER_00]: and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want you to know that just being
here, just the beauty of you all being
[SPEAKER_00]: here and enjoying yourselves and just your
existence alone, you know, as just the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis people, the cannabis tribe,
getting together, enjoying the weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just going home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like miraculous to some
people in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that your existence alone is
really saying a lot to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, in Uruguay, they hear
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hear you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, everybody.
