[SPEAKER_02]: I'm standing here at HempFest in Seattle
with Keith Stropp, the founder of Normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of this event?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite event of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I travel around and do a number of these
kinds of things, but there's nothing on
[SPEAKER_01]: the scale of the Seattle HempFest other
than the Seattle HempFest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those who haven't seen it,
it is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly empowering, and I think
12, 13 years now I've been coming and I
[SPEAKER_01]: find it fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people in other parts of the
country are beginning to pick up on that
[SPEAKER_01]: same phenomena.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Boston Freedom Fest is coming up
in the month, and that's a wonderful thing
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Boston Common with all the history
associated with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the Portland HempSoc, and that's
about the middle of next month as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was here last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12th and 13th of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12th and 13th of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the region at all and you
identify with marijuana smokers or
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana smoking, for Christ's sake,
come to this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will find lots of people that are
like-minded individuals like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I say, you'll feel empowered by it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is peace rather than understanding
that we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace rather than understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Save your seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't take a miracle to cultivate the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't sell brownies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't sell pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't sell Rice Krispies at HempFest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we know how to keep this thing
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will bring us down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an unprecedented amount of freedom
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: No other city in the world, no other rally
in America especially.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any in the world is doing
quite what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please understand, we do not want to be
the narcs now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We arrested our 20 millionth American on
marijuana charges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you ready for 420?
[SPEAKER_07]: In the midsummer, the state of California
determined that it would be missing $1.4
[SPEAKER_07]: billion in taxes if we didn't legalize it
in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably ten times that many nationally.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've helped almost 100,000 people in
eight states get a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: permit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means they can legally possess,
use, and grow medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medical marijuana is a great step forward,
but it's not the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we need to do is end adult marijuana
provision, restore industrial hemp,
[SPEAKER_06]: and help medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp won't be the future of all mankind,
or there won't be a future.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or
a Republican, we're going to legalize
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana no matter what happens in ten
years because when 60% of the American
[SPEAKER_08]: public wants something, they're going to
get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Contact your legislators.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell them, end marijuana provision.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to tax and regulate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The more letters they get like that,
the sooner the day will arrive.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to legalize marijuana!
[SPEAKER_05]: Peaceful!
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this!
[SPEAKER_05]: One of this was a drink fest, alcohol
fest, meth fest, heroin fest, cocaine
[SPEAKER_05]: fest.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be dead people here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be fights.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be stabbings.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's pot fest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are proud.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me an H!
[SPEAKER_05]: E!
[SPEAKER_05]: E!
[SPEAKER_05]: M!
[SPEAKER_05]: M!
[SPEAKER_05]: D!
[SPEAKER_05]: D!
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we want?
Hemp!
[SPEAKER_01]: I freaking love hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp fest is the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp fest is badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go hemp fest!
[SPEAKER_05]: September 12-13, Portland, Kelly Point
Park.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!
Please come!
Everybody's welcome!
Alissa!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
