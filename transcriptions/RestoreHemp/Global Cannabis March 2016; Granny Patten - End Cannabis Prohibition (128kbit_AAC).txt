[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to dedicate this speech to
Aliyah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an 11-year-old child in the great
state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has the same rare illness I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately for that child, she is
unable to get the oil she needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know with my story that it's important
that this oil become legal, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My illness, it's rare and uncurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctors give you a prescription for
medicine that shuts your kidneys down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're done with that, they give you
a brain shunt surgery that most people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, you have to keep having
those surgeries over and over to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: the shunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said no to that surgery three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use only cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely all-natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my spinal pressure down just as
well as the stuff the doctors are giving
[SPEAKER_00]: people that is not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important that we get this federally
legalized, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are dying for this oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day I get messages from people
around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need it legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in a state that we've got the
blessing here that we do have at least
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of freedom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to set an example, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the ones that need to set an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to set an example for the other
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and read what I
wrote today simply because I have a brain
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, so I don't have really good
memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I take two grams of cannabis oil a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three important words I want to
share with you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to say thank you all for
showing up to support cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many people who are depending
on all of us to be their voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me what is it going to take to
get federal legalization, and I tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, eliminate the fear factor by
setting a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're blessed to be living in a state that
is allowing us to have some freedom where
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to use this freedom to show
compassion and grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other states will see that the laws in
their states are unfair and that people
[SPEAKER_00]: will greatly benefit from medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to show others that people
who use cannabis are great and very
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see a show of hands of all the
people out here that are using it for
[SPEAKER_00]: stress or pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the stories, you people's stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the average Joe Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the stories that are going to
get the change we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stay here and tell my story 50
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not very many of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rare brain disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's millions of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your voice to get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to start sharing these
success stories with doctors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hear stories of, like I said,
from me, but they're not hearing it enough
[SPEAKER_00]: from you people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, start a revolution of
kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show unity in your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show up to as many of these events as you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get involved in changing minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change some freaking minds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four, vote for candidates that are
going to help our cause, not hurt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This starts here in our own communities
and our state officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, start pressing for cannabis
to be federally studied by accredited
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some damn studies done.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't know my story,
like I told you, I do have a rare brain
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, but I'm kicking its ass using
cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I would just like to quote,
my human rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hold these truths to be self-evident
that all men are created equal,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are endowed by their creator,
because, damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's make it legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it legal.
Let's make it legal.
