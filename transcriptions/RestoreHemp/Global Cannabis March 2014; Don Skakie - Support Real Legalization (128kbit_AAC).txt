[SPEAKER_00]: Write them emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into their offices and put a face on
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were legislators that said,
oh, 90% of the medical people are fakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just rec users that just want to
smoke pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also here to speak for patients like
William Kurtz, who has a degenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: hereditary disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, 90% of the patients
that I know in Washington don't get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't afford to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are physically unable to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are too ill to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to put our face in front of the
legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to make sure that they know that
medical is legitimate, that recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: is not harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the two must go ahead separately to
protect the best interests of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the people and of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign these initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we get to the vote,
start on your legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a voter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in your district.
[SPEAKER_00]: I voted for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You represent me and medical makes a
difference to me and my community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them what the law should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sit around and wait to vote on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government is not you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them change the law to represent what
we want for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
