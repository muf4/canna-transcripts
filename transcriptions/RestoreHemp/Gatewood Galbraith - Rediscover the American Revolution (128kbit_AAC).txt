[SPEAKER_00]: Hello ladies and gentlemen, this is
Gatewood Galbraith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here in this wonderful city of
Portland, Oregon at the bequest of my
[SPEAKER_00]: longtime friend and marijuana activist and
all-around good guy, Mr. Paul Stanford,
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting here on my right, and the
movement's dream voice on radio and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, Mr. Casper Leach, host of Time
for Hemp, timeforhemp.com, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here today at a fundraiser for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for a fundraiser for
Gatewood Galbraith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am from Kentucky, Lexington,
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an independent candidate for governor
this November in the governor's race in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is May the 15th, I believe,
and so we have about six months to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought me out to be on Paul's TV
program, which I was very honored to be
[SPEAKER_00]: asked, and they have set this up
fundraiser for me in this wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: theater called the Clinton Theater,
and the audience is small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel the dedication to seeing laws
change on a variety of subjects,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes marijuana, in the case of
this group here that I'm associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky was the world's largest producer
of hemp for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was our largest cash crop for more than
a century, and imagine that, a state whose
[SPEAKER_00]: largest cash crop was hemp, and I'm sure
that the smoking aspect of it was also
[SPEAKER_00]: well represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in the early 1900s,
it went down and they legalized it in 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky should be the place where
cannabis is returned as a cash crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Kentucky, and I started out a
long time ago trying to make that a
[SPEAKER_00]: reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fourth generation Kentuckian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 24 years old in a milk land in 1971.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I decided I was grist for the mill,
that I was going to end up in prison or in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail or dead at an early age, so I decided
that I better learn the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I was just going to be a victim of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided I was going to go to college
and become an attorney, and while I was at
[SPEAKER_00]: it, if I was going to put that much into
it, I might as well become governor and
[SPEAKER_00]: change the marijuana laws in the state of
Kentucky and quit treating our people like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in occupied territory and take the
government out of the helicopters,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the air that are hovering over the
fields and gardens of the people of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Kentucky and put marijuana into
the hands of as many sick and dying people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the state as I possibly could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I started out to do 40
years ago, and I've gotten up every day
[SPEAKER_00]: since that time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've run for office in the state of
Kentucky on several occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my fifth time for governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also run for agricultural
commissioner, attorney general,
[SPEAKER_00]: and congress twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've posed some mighty impressive numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bore you with them all,
but let me tell you that this time we is
[SPEAKER_00]: the very best chance that I've ever had to
actually win the governor of the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what that would do to the
political landscape in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an independent elected for the
first time in 150 years in Rhode Island
[SPEAKER_00]: last political season, but he had been a U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: state senator out of that state,
so he already had a statewide basis to go
[SPEAKER_00]: independent with.
[SPEAKER_00]: My running mate and I are totally
independent, no party affiliation
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lady running mate named Dee
Riley who's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother of six, two adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of her natural children has special
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows where the politics hit the road
about policies for women and children in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state, and she's smart as a tack,
and we need more women in leadership roles
[SPEAKER_00]: in the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am running this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, Galbraith, you're a perennial
candidate, and that's where Kentucky's got
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the people in Kentucky who had beaten
me had actually fixed the problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have had to run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't, and they have it,
and they can't because neither party can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a candidate in disengagement of
partisanship long enough to work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leadership of the parties in both
the major parties of the state of Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: had their horns locked up like two bulls
out fighting over territory while the
[SPEAKER_00]: business of the people lays dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my running mate and I say that only an
independent who doesn't care who gets
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for doing what's right for the
people of the state of Kentucky stand the
[SPEAKER_00]: best chance of untying that Gordian knot
and letting both parties operate in a
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion that a lot of the well-intentioned
membership really want to want to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of it is we're not looking to
replace either party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking to throw the rascals
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking for you to vote against
your, you know, your representative or
[SPEAKER_00]: senator and we don't want you to renounce
your family's party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not asking you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not asking you to vote for the
dreaded other party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're asking you to vote for an
independent who wants to work with you to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've offered myself again this
time, and the difference is there are
[SPEAKER_00]: several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all is that everybody's sick and
tired of the gridlock in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they say, I could accuse Kentucky of
being the victim of electile dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't seem to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we think is that we know for a
fact that we're already climbing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: polls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the last time they polled us about
six months ago at 5% and they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: what did you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that's great with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we'll be 10% by May and 15 to
20% by September.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at 13% in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're moving on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really not spending any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have it to spend, but I've never
spent more than $20,000 on any campaign in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent 140,000 on this so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90,000 of it is my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I practice law for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live fee to fee, but I smell it this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell it this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people are sick and tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got endorsed by Union the other day and
I said, why did you folks endorse me?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, because you've never lied to
us, Gatewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, hell, if I was going to
lie to you, I'd already been elected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were understanding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were cluing into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does an election for Gatewood,
Galbraith, and Kentucky mean for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people of the city of Portland and the
people of Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time in my memory that I've
ever heard, the people of America are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a champion who believes that
when the founding fathers conferred
[SPEAKER_00]: sovereignty on us as human beings,
when they said that every human being is
[SPEAKER_00]: endowed by their creator with life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly inalienable rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the American Revolution came about,
we were all property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We belonged to the local king or queen,
to the local warlord, whoever possessed
[SPEAKER_00]: the most gunpowder in the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have any inalienable rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't have any inalienable rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the ruler said, hey, come in here,
off with their head, there you went.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nobody to intercede on your
behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the founding fathers took humankind
out of the category of property and
[SPEAKER_00]: conferred on them the concept of
sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sovereign human beings,
self-determinative, individualized,
[SPEAKER_00]: were something individually and something
that the government couldn't take away or
[SPEAKER_00]: mess with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wrote a constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Declaration of Independence didn't
become law, but the constitution they
[SPEAKER_00]: fashioned to try to immortalize that was
their attempt to write a set of laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to keep that project in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a human revolution, that
conference of sovereignty on the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they turned us loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that kind of freedom,
we've come to America, and that's the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it was supposed to have started out and
what we've been trying to keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that concept of individual sovereignty
is under great pressure today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the current generation is facing the
greatest threat of all of having the Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: of Rights just flat drawn out from
underneath us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the nanny state thought line of
protecting us from ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it is, is absolute assault on the
privileges of sovereign human beings and
[SPEAKER_00]: sovereign citizens of the constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the right to life, liberty,
and pursuit of happiness is not a law
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not in the constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the state of Kentucky, the very
first section of the constitution of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Kentucky says that we're all
possessed of inalienable right to life,
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to reconstruct Kentucky's
policy and Kentucky's government around
[SPEAKER_00]: that thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to rediscover whether
America still has a pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to become the template
of what freedom of the individual means in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we'll become a tourist mecca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that people will come in from
all around the country and the globe to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what it likes to live free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about riots in the
streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about people causing
tumult out in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that the idea that we're
attempting it is going to bring in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right minded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to try to spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to rediscover the
American Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do that by putting the
processes and the surpluses of a form of
[SPEAKER_00]: government out to the people instead of
special interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who those special interests are,
and I'm going to put a stop to it and a
[SPEAKER_00]: savings we're going to put back into the
hands of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can tell you a couple of plans that I
have for the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate if I get that
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting up here with a couple of
movers and shakers in the prospect of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana and marijuana with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said early on that I wanted to make
marijuana legal, but I don't want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legal because eight year olds
can stand on the street corner and eat a
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato and that's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some sort of people ought to be
able to grow their own and be regulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any problem with it,
bring in social services instead of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only that under probable cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's going to be commerce in it,
the government has the right to license
[SPEAKER_00]: and or tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the same thing with widgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it going over to the
corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want Friday night sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want gold in arches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want clearance sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any advertising encouraging
its use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're out here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I'd like to see the
money that's generated go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dealers that people are dealing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're some of the best minds in this
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running a billion dollar business
without a shred of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it ought to stay in the hands of
the people who are putting it out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also going to put it in the hands
of all the sick and dying Kentuckians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take it out in the hands of the
teenagers and put it over to the hands of
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in the old age homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it would put a smile on their
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would increase their appetite and think
about the increased visitation by the
[SPEAKER_00]: young folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's go see dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to educate the kids in the state of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have plans for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out here to see if I can raise any
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a criminal defense attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also for a high salary hire any
lottery winners out there who need a
[SPEAKER_00]: little consultation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a limit on a thousand dollar
contribution in my race for governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no limit on an attorney's
fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who needs any special
consultation, I'm the man to do it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is probably going to be the biggest
issue in this race.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably need to raise about a half
million bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 140,000 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our numbers begin to climb,
I think the money will start to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this early money is the most
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got envelopes down here that if
you want to make a contribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take this envelope and fill it out
and either mail it to us or give it back
[SPEAKER_00]: to me here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the box over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have our handouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our push package.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me and my running mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some people complain about a woman
as a running mate, and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just jealous because she can out
ride, out shoot, and out fish every one of
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's quite a lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have this with me this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my autobiography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called The Last Free Man in America
Meets the Synthetic Subversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the story of 40 years of work on my
behalf to try to find out just what went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with America, what went wrong with
the concept of individual sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the name of the book is The Last Free
Man in America Meets the Synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: Subversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were an agrarian society.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced it all from the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered the plant that was the
answer to all our basic needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably with fuel, medicine, and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they discovered petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they discovered all the synthetic
processes that could be done to extract
[SPEAKER_00]: products from petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided to take the farmer out of
competition with them, not only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemical, but the pharmaceutical and
medicinal aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now a great number of our problems
dealt with because both the major parties
[SPEAKER_00]: that were set up to protect us both on a
national and local level had been bought
[SPEAKER_00]: off with a special interest money,
extraordinary special interest money from
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that I call the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: transnational, corporate, fascist,
elite son of a bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones who have never said they pledge
allegiance to the flag of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States of America or to the republic for
which it stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones who view the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights as impediments to the
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation of a new world order and
global economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people were bought off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people were supposed to be protecting
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to dismantle the
Constitution and our rights just as fast
[SPEAKER_00]: as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they ran into a hard road to home in
the state of Kentucky if I get to be
[SPEAKER_00]: governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recognize them for who they are,
them guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ain't gonna let them guys take over
and make a mockery out of the sacrifices
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the dads and grand dads who hit the
beaches at Normandy and Iwo Jima so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't have to pee in a cup to hold
a job in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna rediscover whether the
people, in fact those people died in vain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every generation must re-win its own
freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it says here in this little
cloud on the front of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all the sacrifices that anybody
in the past up until the last second of my
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to you don't count anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you're willing to do from this
second forward that's gonna decide whether
[SPEAKER_00]: we still have any freedoms to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I became a champion of
marijuana is because I was asthmatic all
[SPEAKER_00]: my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in and out of the hospital on
many occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fourth for the Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the Marines take me by getting a
couple of doctors to say I had outgrown
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Parris Island for six weeks and
somebody pitched some dust in my face and
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into an asthmatic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was discharged from Parris Island
Marines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know marijuana cured asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine came back from Bangkok,
Thailand with some Thai weed and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gatewood, try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, isn't that dangerous?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, it'll help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He later became a doctor so I trusted him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked marijuana the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that, it cured my asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For someone who's gone through a lifetime
of 21 years being totally afraid that at
[SPEAKER_00]: any moment their lungs are gonna close up
on them, let me tell you, that creates a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of free-floating anxiety and a lot of
fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana cured it just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I tell you what, marijuana is a
gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is the gateway to
existentialism.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you discover there's more than one
way
[SPEAKER_00]: of looking at things, there are things
called perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you discover that you have the widest
range of choices you ever imagined you had
[SPEAKER_00]: because you now understand there's a
second way of looking at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just doubled or tripled or quadrupled
the way you can look at things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's damn entertaining trying to figure
out which one has anything to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes it such a wonderful
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just alters your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does getting up and going looking out
the window, getting off the couch,
[SPEAKER_00]: so does thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I discovered it cured my asthma,
what could I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't shut up about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I became its champion and I still am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you just how exhilarated
I am having come out here to Portland and
[SPEAKER_00]: see the kinds of advances that you all
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be associated with a person who's
helped make those advances, Mr. Paul
[SPEAKER_00]: Stanford is just a real thrill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm out here to learn from him because
he's been very successful in helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure all of you all who have
helped him deserve a great deal of that
[SPEAKER_00]: credit, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Casper Leach is known worldwide
for Time for Him, who's had Paul and me
[SPEAKER_00]: and Willie and all kinds of other folks on
Time for Him for, what, 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been at it for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to come out here and be associated with
these people is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am looking into the camera and I
know that this is going to be played in
[SPEAKER_00]: places other than this theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running for governor in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had $700 on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was divorcing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty well bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't going to give up on the
governor's end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went out and I rented a TV camera and
a chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat in the camera and looked into the
camera and gave who I was, what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I paid them another $400 to send it
up on satellite.
[SPEAKER_00]: No particular time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days later, I'm coming back to my law
office and there's a note on the door that
[SPEAKER_00]: says, Gatewood, call your ex-wife Willie
Nelson is trying to get out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I called my ex-wife because my
phones had been cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she said, yeah, Willie was driving
down the road on his bus, surfing the
[SPEAKER_00]: channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he caught the whole 30 minutes of you
looking into the camera and talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says he wants to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I called Willie and we got
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole story about how that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a pretty good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is that you can never tell
how far your voice is going to carry into
[SPEAKER_00]: who's going to be watching this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm telling you that if you want to
advance freedom and individual freedom and
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt to find out whether America still
has a voice, the Gatewood Galbraith D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riley campaign for governor of the state
of Kentucky is the one to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we figure we need about a half million
and we've raised about 150,000 thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always use a big dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time some big dogs got involved in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're willing to advance the idea of
America more than anybody else is in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just the guy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was voted the honoredest kid to ever
come out of Nicholas County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just the guy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been just ecstatic about my treatment
out here and meeting all you fine folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can make a contribution tonight,
I have a book for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't, I probably still have a
book for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm that kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
