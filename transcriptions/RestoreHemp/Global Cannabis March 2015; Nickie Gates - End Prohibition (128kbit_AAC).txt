[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just say Portland is absolutely
beautiful today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to first, I want to know if
anybody's asking the patients what they
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, because they can't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if anybody was, the number of
plants a grower can grow would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the amount of patients a grower can
grow for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't be dropping in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are too many patients that depend
and rely on topicals, edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalants, feco, or RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of plants to be able to
provide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know we can't or shouldn't stop
taking it, or what ails you can and will
[SPEAKER_00]: return.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will definitely be a rise in six
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if anybody's still asking
the patients what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to ask the patients what they need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we just don't care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a patient and I care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we've opened the other spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a recycled, refurbished, and reused
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place where we as the community
gather in safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also provide a gathering place for many
community groups, such as OGF,
[SPEAKER_00]: CRRH, Hamstock, Oregon Normal,
Cannabis Genetics Preservation Society,
[SPEAKER_00]: Human Solution International, Parents for
Pot, and Ganja Gals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can hear this, this community
place, let me say again, community,
[SPEAKER_00]: is where activities and events are
constantly going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our Canifer Cause coming up July
18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will shut down the street on Harold and
72nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have music, vendors, artists,
barbecues, and kids fashion shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope to see you all come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proceeds will benefit Parents for Pot
International or national.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just one of the things that the
other spot does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon there will be nowhere for
anyone to go and medicate and be social
[SPEAKER_00]: under one common roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: These places like the other spot don't
exist, then our sociability dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We and me myself believe that there needs
to be 50 more of these places to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: medicate and be social.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly enough medical
dispensaries out there, but where the
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean Air Act comes in, there will be
nowhere for us to go and medicate out of
[SPEAKER_00]: public view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we as patients will continue to break
this law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is important for you to support
places like TOS that supports you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This place is not my place, but it's our
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't talk the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please walk the walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel that there's anything that you
can't give, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up a phone, make a phone call,
write a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're sitting behind your
computers, send an email to your
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the Capitol, show your presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something you can give or
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank my husband, Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't get enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Jesse and Mary for taking
this ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to thank my family and my
friends for all the continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
