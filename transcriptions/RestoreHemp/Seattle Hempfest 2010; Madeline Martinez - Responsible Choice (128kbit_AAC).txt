[SPEAKER_01]: Hi everybody, I'm Madeline Martinez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the executive director of the Oregon
affiliate to national normal I'm on the
[SPEAKER_01]: board of normal and I'm also The owner and
founder of the world famous cannabis cafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've heard about it But
it got a lot of news coverage,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our state we have a new progressive
Measure on the ballot in its measure 74
[SPEAKER_01]: and John Sage Oh back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to congratulate you For
getting it on the ballot John you worked
[SPEAKER_01]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's a regulated supply system for
medical marijuana patients and medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana what a beautiful thing That's
how I became an activist because I
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody told me no at Kaiser They said no
you can't have medical marijuana because
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have glaucoma cancer or AIDS
Well, I don't take no for an answer very
[SPEAKER_01]: well I'm a product of the 60s the
turbulent 60s a child of dr. King And I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't take no for an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of those fiery Latinas that says
oh, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so anyway Kaiser ended up giving me
one of their first letters saying that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was okay for me to use medical marijuana
and I have been there since the
[SPEAKER_01]: implementation of the Oregon Medical
Marijuana Act fighting in one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another to make sure that patients rights
were not stepped on trampled on and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: actually been able to get 24 ounces of
Stored marijuana we started out with three
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was laughable because how do you
control a plant with three, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that you only have three ounces
Well, we fought every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally got in 2007 24 ounces of usable
marijuana, which was a huge success for
[SPEAKER_01]: all of us Believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing to be able to have that
much at the legislature We sat down and we
[SPEAKER_01]: spoke with law enforcement They had been
after the affirmative defense for years
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were gonna come and take it and
give us nothing in return and Regulate it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the point where there was only one
growth for her residents So that wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I found that Legislature
legislators are actually really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: people if you sit down and talk to them,
they have stories as well So please I
[SPEAKER_01]: always tell people you've got to get
involved like Douglas and Brian and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone else you got to get down there
and you got to let them know who you are
[SPEAKER_01]: and We teach, you know patients and other
members of normal How to use those tools
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively how to make sure that they go
and they make contact with these people Of
[SPEAKER_01]: course, like everyone else my dream is
legalization and boy I really am excited
[SPEAKER_01]: Douglas about your language and I'd like
to see if we can do it in Oregon with you
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it's gonna take the whole
country Yeah, we're gonna have to unite
[SPEAKER_01]: and get this taken care of because
although Medical marijuana is a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: thing in my state people are losing their
jobs every day because of a dirty way I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, it's just not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're losing their children Their
children are being taken away from them in
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty custody battles where someone says
you use medical marijuana I mean I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: even tell you if someone tried to take my
child from me I would not be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: breathe and So to think that someone can
take your child from you even though
[SPEAKER_01]: you've applied for the protections
Afforded to you is just not acceptable
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I say it's time for us to all
stand up but the joint down Step away from
[SPEAKER_01]: your bond just for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I've been smoking since I was 16
and I'm not gonna put it down I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke until the day that I die I'm looking
for somebody to hook me up with one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those oxygen things so I can just vaporize
through the little nostril part,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know when I get too old but no,
I'm gonna and I think it's important for
[SPEAKER_01]: all of us, you know Douglas was just
talking about him and I watched Jack
[SPEAKER_01]: Harris Emperor of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: May he rest in peace and I actually
tattooed it on my arm I always I always
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted a big tattoo and I've got time ma
the first character for him ma on my arm
[SPEAKER_01]: and and that man was a hero to me and he
made me the hemp activist I am today
[SPEAKER_01]: because America's roots are hemp roots our
financial our foundation our economy
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually used hemp in it and why aren't we
using why aren't we going back to those
[SPEAKER_01]: roots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear people constantly touting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh our founders are found our founders or
hemp farmers Because they were smart
[SPEAKER_01]: enough just like birds to eat the hemp
seed You know when you think about it
[SPEAKER_01]: birds are more intelligent than our
Congress people than our own government
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll eat those hemp seeds first and we
need to make that clear to our to our
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress We need to make that clear to
President Obama.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have hemp fuel No other Americans
should go die for a foreign fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can we can grow it in our country the
residue from that fuel once it's pressed
[SPEAKER_01]: Is hemp flower rich in the omegas?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we all fight for this and we must
continue to move forward in our state
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky enough that our senator Floyd
Prisanski actually passed legislation
[SPEAKER_01]: where hemp is now something that's
acceptable It's the law in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course those pesky feds We're
waiting for their approval as always with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and that's why I think
Douglas's approach to marijuana May I ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you I'm just gonna ask this public Because
I've asked other people as an attorney if
[SPEAKER_01]: we legalize marijuana isn't hemp then
legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some states yes, and in some states no
Our initiative removes ambiguity But a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of states have measures in place that if
the federal government changes its stance
[SPEAKER_00]: on hemp Or on hemp permits that they can
go immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Kentucky's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know North Dakota's one So there are
some states that are ready to go in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they've defined the marijuana plant So
yeah, there are some states that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be legal the minute the pets say
so excellent So I'm gonna stop using the
[SPEAKER_01]: word regulate now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a good lesson just like the rest of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more regulation We're just gonna
legalize That's the new term and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what we can say because when you say
the word legalization It really does scare
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people and when you say the tax
the word tax that frightens them even more
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to turn around and run away
because that it's scary to think of Being
[SPEAKER_01]: taxed again, especially in this economic
time But I think that when we look at our
[SPEAKER_01]: economy and if we look at the fact that in
the state of Oregon for us 350,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregonians consume cannabis on a regular
basis according to government statistics
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look at that in an economic from
an economic perspective, it seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: with medical marijuana patients We're
targeting the wrong population segment of
[SPEAKER_01]: the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be targeting that 350,000 people
Or more and get this get these jobs going
[SPEAKER_01]: we need green jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, they don't get much greener than
growing pot I actually went to one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: legislators and said, you know I used to
work in a women's prison and we have all
[SPEAKER_01]: this property in there and I said Why
don't we use that land and we have all
[SPEAKER_01]: these wonderful students that know how to
grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we grow marijuana for the
patients in the in the prison?
[SPEAKER_01]: securities there But you know,
some people have said I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm well, maybe I am a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I am a dreamer, you know But I think
that we can make it all work with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: money we spend on the prison system Let's
get something in return Don't you think I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Merkley now is one of our
congresspeople and but he did he had the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation with me at least he was open
enough to have that conversation People
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't always trying to get into prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when and it's not easy to get out I can
tell you for one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway I am pushing it every way I can
to make sure that we let people know that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just like myself I'm just a normal
mom blazing the Oregon Trail every day
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make it work for everybody
Everybody needs to be recognized as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumers, not just patients We
have veterans with PTSD and they're they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't qualify in our state and it's a
shame when you look at those people going
[SPEAKER_01]: and risking their lives for us and we
cannot even afford a medical marijuana You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, that's what we all fight for the
people that can't have it those of us who
[SPEAKER_01]: are lucky enough Should I say degenerative
disc and joint disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you want to count that as
lucky but I get to have a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana card But what about the veterans
that don't what about the lady who lost
[SPEAKER_01]: her children?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we must legalize as soon as possible
Please join normal Thank you You You
