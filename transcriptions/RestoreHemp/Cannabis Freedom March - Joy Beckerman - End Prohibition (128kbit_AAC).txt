[SPEAKER_00]: We had two bills this year, SB5012 and
HB1552 for industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We suggested the most minimal possible
regulations that we could suggest in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain the integrity of an industrial
hemp crop with the sophisticated markets
[SPEAKER_00]: that exist today and to be compliant with
the new Legitimacy of Industrial Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Research Act that was passed on a federal
level in February of 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, our minimal regulations were too
minimal for the Washington State
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture who have
inserted themselves into the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: process and requested multiple amendments
to our minimal regulations that they then
[SPEAKER_00]: projected with a fiscal note of $900,000
in order to administer an industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: program here agriculturally for our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will cost nowhere near $900,000 for
them to administer a reasonable,
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant industrial hemp program in our
state, but they wanted their hands in the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing of hemp in certain labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is that the Liquor Control
Board does not oversee marijuana testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana producers take their own
test sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring it to a third-party authorized
testing facility, and there are labs set
[SPEAKER_00]: all through our state, and everything is
done by third-party authorized folks and
[SPEAKER_00]: with producers who take their own sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: The WSDA, the Washington State Department
of Agriculture, insisted that they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know, in Canada,
they've had legal industrial hemp since
[SPEAKER_00]: 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a booming industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy 90% of the industrial hemp seeds
and hemp seed oil and other derivatives
[SPEAKER_00]: that come from the proteins of the hemp
plant from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Canada, which governs the
industrial hemp program in that country,
[SPEAKER_00]: does not oversee the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not go out into the fields and
collect tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's actually a revenue-generated
generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They authorize professional agrologists to
become licensed field samplers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the farmer pays a couple of hundred
dollars, in many cases less, to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: third-party come out and take their test
once a year, collect a sample of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take it to a third-party testing
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Health Canada doesn't deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't bear the expense of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't supply the human resources and
the mass spectrometers and the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatographs required for all of that
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Liquor Control Board doesn't do it
either here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're talking about marijuana,
not even a non-drug oil seed and fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Washington State Department of
Agriculture decided, no, we need to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the test, the sample actually being
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to test that sample ourselves and
invest in hundreds of thousands of dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis testing equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, it's going to cost almost a
million dollars, which is far too much for
[SPEAKER_00]: an industrial hemp crop that we don't
think is going to earn any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, even though we have two live
bills, even a live still in our special
[SPEAKER_00]: session, they are both stalled at the
House Appropriations Committee level,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Washington Hemp Industries
Association is working overtime providing
[SPEAKER_00]: economic data and other evidence to prove
to them that their projection of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation is far, far more expensive than
it needs to be, why it is, and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: money there is to be made with industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would really appreciate it if you
folks would join.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you need to do is go to join Hemp
.net to become a supporting member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington Hemp Industries Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only $50 a year to become a
supporting member.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got to clean up carbon emissions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got to clean up heavy pesticide
use, heavy water use, heavy fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are ruining the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are ruining the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have already all but destroyed the
American farm and the farming industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp will re-energize that and
will also bring health not only to our
[SPEAKER_00]: lands and our soil, to our soils and our
waters, but to our biosphere, to our
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also am very honored to sit on the board
for the Center for the Study of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and Social Policy, as well as the normal
women of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am involved with compliance in law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a dual career over the last 20
years or so in complex civil litigation
[SPEAKER_00]: and compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to make sure folks realized
that in this SB5052 that has passed,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has stripped away many of the rights
that patients have been enjoying in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Washington since the voters spoke
overwhelmingly in 1998 to legalize the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be that folks that held medical
marijuana authorization, patients who
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on the safe whole plant medicine to
manage a variety of medical conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of life issues, everything from
glaucoma to multiple sclerosis to wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome to chronic pain syndrome to a
variety of terminal illnesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: they used to be able to grow 15 plants
themselves, those who had to, those who
[SPEAKER_00]: could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they voluntarily register,
which many folks do view as a HIPAA or a
[SPEAKER_00]: privacy right violation that we would need
to register for our medicine, put our
[SPEAKER_00]: names on a list, those folks will be able
to grow six plants now, not 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't volunteer to be on the
registry, you'll only be able to grow four
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as a patient instead of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason for 15 is of course for
those of you who depend on this safe whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant medicine for your conditions or for
your quality of life, oftentimes 15 plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are required to produce the actual
quantity of medicine that would be needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage a health condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most folks who have a serious illness
don't consume by smoking marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: they consume it by eating it or ingesting
it, requires more plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collectives used to be able to have 10
members, they'll go down to four members
[SPEAKER_00]: now that this law has been passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we've been able to go to
these medical marijuana clinics to get our
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana authorizations,
those who have qualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana clinics as we know them
will be dissolved by law in two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: months, July 23rd of 2015, that's this
year, that's this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All medical marijuana clinics as we know
them will be dissolved by law and guess
[SPEAKER_00]: who is left to authorize your use of
marijuana for medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your primary care provider, I'd like you
to ask yourself how likely is your primary
[SPEAKER_00]: care provider to issue you an
authorization for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a place where activists
and patients and people who believe in the
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom of this plant need to work with
their clinics, need to work with their
[SPEAKER_00]: medical providers, need to work with their
primary care providers to tell them not
[SPEAKER_00]: only is the huge need here and to give
them information and hard data that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need easily found on multiple websites
across the worldwide web, also let them
[SPEAKER_00]: know there is money to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have to work on that,
we have to work on the economic aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp all the time, we have to
dangle the carrot of money in order to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people to buy into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also how we're ending the drug war
with money, proving that these billions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars have done nothing but let the
black market flourish while we have
[SPEAKER_00]: continued drug addiction, amazing
statistics of drug addiction and crime
[SPEAKER_00]: superseding most other parts of the world
right here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to tell you is that
medical marijuana dispensaries as we know
[SPEAKER_00]: them will be dissolved by law unless we
can get some sensible legislation or
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative passed by July of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next summer, right now eligible
existing medical marijuana dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: are being asked now to apply for a medical
endorsement not from the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health, from the liquor control board,
a medical endorsement from the liquor
[SPEAKER_00]: control board and those that actually make
it through the gauntlet of compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: issues which will no doubt move and each
compliance target will change as the
[SPEAKER_00]: process goes on, they will then be allowed
to be rolled into existing recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana stores, we don't have a ton of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many patients, tens of thousands of
patients across our state are
[SPEAKER_00]: impoverished, disabled, they live in rural
areas, they need safe and legal access to
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole plant medicine that they have
come to rely upon that doesn't have side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, that does improve their quality
of life, that does treat their condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to be vigilant, we need to work
with our primary care providers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to contact our legislators,
you guys don't let anybody fool you,
[SPEAKER_00]: we live in an amazing country and an even
more amazing state and our legislators on
[SPEAKER_00]: a state and a federal level, they work for
us and most of them are fully aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and they want to hear from you and
it's so easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please take the empowerment given to us
by the folks who created our country,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the folks who drafted the constitution
for the state of Washington and for the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and let's use our voices,
use our phones and start being brave and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting our light shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone for showing up today.
