[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited to be here with you today
on such an absolutely gorgeous day for the
[SPEAKER_00]: 17th annual Global Cannabis March.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kimberly McCullough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the legislative director with the
American Civil Liberties Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for some of you who may not know who
the ACLU is, we are a nonpartisan
[SPEAKER_00]: organization dedicated to advancing civil
rights and civil liberties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our national organization is almost 100
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our Oregon affiliate is celebrating
our 60th anniversary this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work on a broad range of issues,
many of which intersect with the ongoing
[SPEAKER_00]: need for drug reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1973, we supported legislation to make
Oregon the first state to decriminalize
[SPEAKER_00]: possession of small amounts of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1990s, we beat back attempts to
recriminalize marijuana and helped craft
[SPEAKER_00]: the successful ballot measure that created
Oregon's medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're grateful to have also been part of
the Measure 91 campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we continue to be involved in this
work because we want Oregon's experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with legal marijuana to be a successful
model for other states and to lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: federal reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to just talk to you about
marijuana today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to talk about the decades-long
drug war that has ensnared millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: people into America's criminal justice
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our society and our government made a huge
mistake when we decided to regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: certain drugs, like marijuana,
through prohibition, criminalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization, and stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of dealing with drugs as a public
health issue, we set in motion machinery
[SPEAKER_00]: that deeply eroded fundamental rights
crucial to our democracy, tore families
[SPEAKER_00]: apart, and locked people in cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we've made incredible progress
legalizing marijuana in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth is that so much of the drug wars
machinery is still operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact it's made and continues to make
will take a huge amount of work to
[SPEAKER_00]: rectify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get to finishing drug reform or
to more drug reform that we need?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to shift the narrative and change
our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of talking about being tough on
crime, we need to talk about being smart
[SPEAKER_00]: on crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being smart on crime means that we
know that dealing with drugs as a criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: issue doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Criminalizing drugs makes us less safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pushes people that need help into the
shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It disproportionately impacts the poor and
people of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives power to cartels who are
terrorizing our neighbors in nations to
[SPEAKER_00]: the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we shift away from criminalization,
we need to instead focus on public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our laws and our efforts should be aimed
at promoting health in our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good for people who need medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: What helps people who have addictions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what actually keeps us safe and free?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't become complacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't think that merely decriminalizing
marijuana in Oregon is enough because the
[SPEAKER_00]: damage that has been done is so deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even here in Oregon, we still have
marijuana reform that needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Criminal penalties for marijuana related
crimes are still too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though alcohol is a much more
dangerous drug, criminal penalties that
[SPEAKER_00]: remain on the books for marijuana are
still much higher than the same types of
[SPEAKER_00]: penalties for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, employees in Oregon can still
be fired for using marijuana even if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tenants in Oregon can still be evicted
from their homes because they use or
[SPEAKER_00]: possess marijuana in their homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this needs to change and we have to
be also vigilant in protecting our medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, the ACLU has been
at the forefront of drug reform for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time and we're not stopping anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sincere hope is that you won't stop
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand that the march is about to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys can head up that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards the beginning of the march.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go get them.
Thank you.
