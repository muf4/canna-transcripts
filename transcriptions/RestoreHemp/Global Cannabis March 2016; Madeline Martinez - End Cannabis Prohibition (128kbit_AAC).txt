[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Scott, and thank you,
Oregon Normal, Portland Normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone who helped put this march
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, to all of you,
Stoners, my people!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to be ashamed of because
we smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be proud and march with us and show your
cannabis pride out there and let people
[SPEAKER_00]: know that we're not different from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're law-abiding citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just choose a different substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safer than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not out there beating our wives and
making a mess of our family lives because
[SPEAKER_00]: we use cannabis safely and responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is Normal's message, the national
organization for the reform of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the oldest organization,
reform organization in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the United States, but the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we are in every part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I was lucky enough to have to
head Oregon Normal, and we became the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest chapter, almost 3,000 members,
pain members, in the knowing galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were bigger than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the end of an era when we left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell you what, Normal's doing a
great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the national level, and we've got a
lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to fix these ridiculous laws
about medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please listen to what Lori said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the medical marijuana program strong,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fought so long and so hard for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be involved somehow, some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm here because not only am I a
professional stoner, but I'm a political
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here stumping for Bernie Sanders
because Bernie Sanders can save America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump's a chump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sick and tired of hearing people
tell me that he's going to win the
[SPEAKER_00]: presidential election.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I just say to you,
one of my issues right now with Kate
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown, the governor of our great state,
and I love Kate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go back a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it behooves each of us
Portland, Oregon citizens to let her know
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are all about Bernie Sanders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a number here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call Kate Brown, our governor,
and let her know that you would like her
[SPEAKER_00]: to represent Portland and Oregon properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are Bernie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a blue state, and I love Hillary.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't have somebody who's beholding
to Wall Street in the White House.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't we had enough of that already?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fight hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, the primary's coming up here
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote for Bernie Sanders, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you feel, go out and let Kate Brown
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her number is 503-378-4582.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just remember, people, we are
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't let our voices be heard,
then we have no right to complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not a registered voter,
we've got voter registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right over here at the Bernie booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some at the Oregon Normal and CCRH
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go look for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Register to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
