[SPEAKER_00]: Now in Southern Oregon we got the Southern
Oregon Sungrower's Guild, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's pretty cool with people getting
together to cooperate on testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: hiring the lobbyists to speak for outdoor,
sun-grown, good organic herbs and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it remains legal, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things that could be done
to just pardon me, but really fuck this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope that through beds like this and
an emerging thing all over the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, just feeling like we got to find
justice and we got to figure it out right
[SPEAKER_00]: away, man, in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with the trouble with the
police, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel like they're in a war zone,
man, and we're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can go away as long as, like as soon
as we say go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put me down for one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add an old brown corn there to Mayoneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks even worse than it did last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day brings doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year brings fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll have to sell the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how could it be wrong if it grows
wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll ease your mind and make you smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a farm paid off in just a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can it be wrong if it grows wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always tried to be an honest man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried to make a living off the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it ain't never been what I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a hard life to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could it be wrong if it grows wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll ease your mind and make you smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a new crop in just a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could it be wrong if it grows wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I almost had the farm paid off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got raided by the crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they took my money and they took my
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that it's a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how could it be wrong if it grows
wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll ease your mind and make you smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a brand new crop in just a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could it be wrong if it grows wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: Add an old brown corn there to Mayoneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks even worse than it did last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year brings doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day brings fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll have to sell the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a new McDonald ain't got no farm.

down.
[SPEAKER_01]: E-I-O.

[SPEAKER_01]: There's no one left for to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a new McDonald ain't got no corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: E-I-O.
