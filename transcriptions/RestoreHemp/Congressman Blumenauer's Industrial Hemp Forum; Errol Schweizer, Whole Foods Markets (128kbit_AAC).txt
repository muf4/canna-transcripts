[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little about Whole Foods Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be familiar with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few stores here in the metro
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we evaluate a product, we run it
through our core values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I think we have eight
core values.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell the highest quality natural
organic foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does hemp qualify?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create ongoing win-win partnerships
with our suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have awesome suppliers who provide us
with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We support team member excellence and
happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp makes us happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We serve and support local and global
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it looks like the state of Oregon
wants us to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create wealth through profits and
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go into a little bit more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, legal hemp can be profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We practice and advance environmental
stewardship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is a sustainable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's non-genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: We satisfy, delight, and nourish our
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Affirmative, hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we promote the health of our
stakeholders through healthy eating
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, hemp is also healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my little Oregon hemp logo there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it on PowerPoint this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you probably all know this,
preaching to the choir here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp functions as a nutritional
powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been vegan and vegetarian for parts
of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not now, but when I was, hemp was a
major source of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much better source of protein than
almond or other nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot more digestible and healthy
than soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's healthy fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complete profile fatty acids, got vitamin
E for immunity, and plenty of dietary
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes good, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also one of our displays from
our last hemp history promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Featuring products, it looks like,
from Living Harvest and Manto Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of hemp leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably seen stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of the market justification.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff you can do with
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tables out there from Hemp
Industries Association and their allies
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have hemp seeds, hemp stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard Congressman Blumenauer mention
about a half a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's radically underestimated
just from how much I know we sell and
[SPEAKER_00]: going out to our competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing two pound bags of hemp seeds in
Costco now, going to farmers markets and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing hemp everywhere, I estimate that
number is a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does not even scratch the surface
of the market potential when you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things you can do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know that cars currently have hemp
parts now, a lot of imported cars?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp at Whole Foods, we've got about 90
brands that currently use hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, mostly from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 300 products on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really have very good data at
Whole Foods, so it's our estimate,
[SPEAKER_00]: as my friend Christina would know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's about 25% annual growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a multiple of three or four of
our own company growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of our top growing trends right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been like that for the last
three to four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the core ingredient in
growth brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got all these awesome companies
that are utilizing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more recent items, including a
really great veggie burger from Kansas
[SPEAKER_00]: called Hillary's.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a hemp burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a hemp tofu that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of soybean tofu, it's going to be
a tofu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got a lot of products that we
can be derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, soap and cleaning products is a
big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-dairy beverages, hemp as a nut milk
for cereal, for baking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal, snacks, and bars, Nature's Path
has done a fabulous job with marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetarian meat and protein sources,
so not just protein shakes as an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative to whey or soy, but also,
like I said, meat alternatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: and burgers, and hot dogs, and tofu,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually seen hemp yogurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if we've commercialized it
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential fatty acids and culinary oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stuff that's not necessarily
selling groceries, textiles, and apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, talking to our
construction team about utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: hempcrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did a promotion on hemp as a
concrete source in Colorado this summer
[SPEAKER_00]: during our hemp history week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were showing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like cinder blocks made out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the brands that we've
worked really closely with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're doing hemp history week
promotions now for about three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year, I think we've gotten
better at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big thanks to Cristina O'Gasey and
the Bronner's Hooks, but also these other
[SPEAKER_00]: brands, Living Harvest, Manitoba Harvest,
Nature's Path, and New Teva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a display.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, everything's bigger in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a Texas-sized hemp display out of
the Delaware store in Houston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great grocery team leader there who
really gets behind the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture from the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is in Arlington in
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are hemp stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't wait to go visit Rick's
farm to see him standing by 15 foot tall
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp stalks this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick, I'd like that exclusive on your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 2013, our hemp history week
promo.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 880 events.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more than even just Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to 300% sales lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to bore you with numbers
here, but I think we do over a million in
[SPEAKER_00]: sales in like two weeks on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Products that included hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the other stuff that you guys
heard today, about 20 states, 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then internally, we just did a lot of
PR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last years, we've had some really good
blogs, social media, in-source signage,
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing demos, a lot of customer
engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks really get behind it, really excited
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our team members building displays,
doing demos, and talking to customers
[SPEAKER_00]: about all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it leads me to say to you folks,
what the hemp are we waiting for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a, I don't know if you call it
a sprig of hemp from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get to attend the first ever legal
domestic industrial cultivation of hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: southeastern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an incredible experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hemp did taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
