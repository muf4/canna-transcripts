[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you a couple of plans that I
have for the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd appreciate if I get that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting up here with a couple of
movers and shakers in the prospect of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana and marijuana to the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said early on that I wanted to make
marijuana legal, but I don't want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legal because eight-year-olds
can stand on the street corner and eat a
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato and that's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some sort of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ought to be able to grow their own
and be regulated by families.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any problem with it,
bring in social services instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only that under probable cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's going to be commerce in it,
the government has the right to license
[SPEAKER_00]: and or tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the same thing with widgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it going over to the
corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want Friday night sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want gold in arches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want clearance sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any advertising encouraging
its use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're out here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I'd like to see the
money that's generated go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dealers, the people who are dealing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're some of the best minds of this
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running a billion-dollar business
without a shred of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it ought to stay in the hands of
the people who are putting it out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also going to put it in the hands
of all the sick and dying Kentuckians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take it out in the hands of the
teenagers and put it over to the hands of
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in the old age homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it would put a smile on their
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would increase their appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about the increased visitation
by the young folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's go see Dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to educate the kids in the state of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have plans for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out here to see if I can raise any
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a criminal defense attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also for hire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any lottery winners out there who need a
little consultation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a limit on a $1,000 contribution
in my race for governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no limit on an attorney's
fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who needs any special
consultation, I'm the man to do it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is probably going to be the biggest
issue in this race.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably need to raise about a half
million bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at $140,000 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our numbers begin to climb,
I think the money will start to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this early money is the most
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got envelopes down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you want to make a contribution,
you can take this envelope and fill it out
[SPEAKER_00]: and either mail it to us or give it back
to me here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the box over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have our handouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our push package.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me and my running mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some people complain about a woman
as a running mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you're just jealous because
she can out ride out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shooting out fish every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's quite a lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have this with me this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my autobiography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called The Last Free Man in America
Meets the Synthetic Subversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the story of 40 years of work on my
behalf to try to find out just what went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with America.
[SPEAKER_00]: What went wrong with the concept of
individual sovereignty?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the name of the book is The Last Free
Man in America Meets the Synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: Subversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we were an agrarian society.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced it all from the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered the plant that was the
answer to all our basic needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably with fuel, medicine, and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they discovered petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they discovered all the synthetic
processes that could be done to extract
[SPEAKER_00]: the products from petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided to take the farmer out of
competition with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only in the petrochemical,
but the pharmaceutical and medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now a great number of our problems
dealt with because both the major parties
[SPEAKER_00]: that were set up to protect us,
both on a national and local level,
[SPEAKER_00]: had been bought off with a special
interest money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraordinary special interest money from
the people that I call the petrochemical,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
transnational corporate fascist elite son
[SPEAKER_00]: of a bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones who have never said the pledge of
allegiance to the flag of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States of America or to the republic for
which it stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones who view the constitution and
the bill of rights as impediments to the
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation of a new world order and
global economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people were bought off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people were supposed to be protecting
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to dismantle the
constitution and our rights just as fast
[SPEAKER_00]: as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they ran into a hard road to hold in
the state of Kentucky if I get to be
[SPEAKER_00]: governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recognize them for who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Them guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ain't going to let them guys take
over and make a mockery out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrifices of all the dads and grand dads
who hit the beaches at Normandy and Iwo
[SPEAKER_00]: Jima so that you wouldn't have to pee in a
cup to hold a job in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to rediscover whether the
people that, in fact, those people died in
[SPEAKER_00]: vain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every generation must re-win its own
freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it says here in this little
cloud on the front of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all the sacrifices that anybody
in the past up until the last second of my
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to you don't count anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you're willing to do from this
second forward that's going to decide
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we still have freedoms to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I became a champion of
marijuana is because I was asthmatic all
[SPEAKER_00]: my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in and out of the hospital on
many occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fourth for the Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the Marines take me by getting a
couple of doctors to say I had outgrown
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Parris Island for six weeks and
somebody pitched some dust in my face and
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into an asthmatic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was discharged from Parris Island to the
Marines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know marijuana cured asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine came back from Bangkok,
Thailand with some Thai weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And said, Gate, we'll try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, isn't that dangerous?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, it'll help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He later became a doctor so I trusted him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked marijuana the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cured my asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For someone who's gone through a lifetime
of 21 years being totally afraid that at
[SPEAKER_00]: any moment their lungs are going to close
up on them, let me tell you, that creates
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of free-floating anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana cured it just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I tell you what, marijuana is a
gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is the gateway to
existentialism.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you discover there's more than one
reality, when you discover that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: no just one way of looking at things,
there are things called perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you discover that you have the widest
range of choices you ever imagined you had
[SPEAKER_00]: because you now understand there's a
second way of looking at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just doubled or tripled or quadrupled
the way you can look at things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's damn entertaining trying to figure
out which one has anything to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes it such a wonderful
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just alters your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does getting up and going looking out
the window, getting off the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just alters your perspective.
That's what makes it so wonderful.
