[SPEAKER_00]: For the one and only, Jack Herrer
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these people know me from 1984.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up here to Oregon and Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built an initiative over and over and
over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put on the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought it in 1980, 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out and got the fucking
signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of rain will fall,
but it's okay because we got it for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year before that, we bought it for
medicine in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis put
[SPEAKER_00]: on 750,000 signatures and we passed it on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got it all over the fucking state
except for redneck areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 years after we passed the law,
it's still going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing fucking better for the
human race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than having marijuana morning,
noon, and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live two years longer than people that
don't smoke and don't drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eight to 24 years longer than people
that do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be out of your mind not to smoke
dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you know this, even two years longer
if you smoke it, if you eat the seed out
[SPEAKER_00]: of three million seeds and food stuff on
earth, the number one thing in the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: world is hemp from one to a hundred before
you get to soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, second, third, fiftieth,
ninetieth, a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chains of everything on earth and the
number one chain to a hundred is hemp feed
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's against the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know it in public school,
high school, or college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that 98% of all the food and
clothing of the whole world was hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the best thing the world has ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had the United States government,
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they could go to fucking jail
for getting you and me and 20 million
[SPEAKER_00]: people the safest thing you can do in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to do in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come over to my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come over there and I will see you next
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give it up for Jack Herrera
everybody.
