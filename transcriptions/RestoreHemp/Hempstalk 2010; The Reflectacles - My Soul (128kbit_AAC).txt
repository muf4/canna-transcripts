[SPEAKER_00]: Carving into wood A man without a real
fate Where a thousand people stood If it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes your time less dreadful Spend it
standing on my back With no will to
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate me Cause I wasn't built to laugh
No, I wasn't built to laugh Hands
[SPEAKER_00]: can't hold water If they hold it in too
close And wings that have no feathers They
[SPEAKER_00]: are valued just like gold So take a step
back Look at yourself What you've become
[SPEAKER_00]: As you scream into the cornfield Praying
for a gentle sun My soul is so rusty From
[SPEAKER_00]: the bones that you're picking They'll
leave out just to get burned My soul is so
[SPEAKER_01]: rusty From the bones that you hold on my
hand You've been just out of reach The
[SPEAKER_00]: ashes of the metal Burn inside your flame
And if you cover all your eyes then You're
[SPEAKER_00]: never gonna see any change So take a step
back Climb in your bed Block out the sound
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause heaven's got its stories Just like
any other town And now my soul
[SPEAKER_01]: My soul is so rusty From the bones that
you're picking They'll leave out just to
get burned
My soul is so rusty Thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
