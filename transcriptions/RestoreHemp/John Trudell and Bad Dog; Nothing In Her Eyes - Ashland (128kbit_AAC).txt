[SPEAKER_00]: Spoke in anger, silent hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some kind of wheel inside her head,

[SPEAKER_00]: Chilling effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they first met, she couldn't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time's only purpose was for them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They laid together and were gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked together and were flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: She told him her dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: She told him her prayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: She needed a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: She needed a man inside
[SPEAKER_00]: her head, going around and around and
around and around.
[SPEAKER_00]: As newness stretches thin, turns out he
didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the man let her down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the man couldn't give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the man he never was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the man, part of her life,
been all through this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside her heart, going around and around
and around and around.

[SPEAKER_00]: Now here she is, acting tough again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning herself off fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curtains dropping in place, giving away
nothing, nothing, nothing in her eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoke in anger, silent hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some kind of wheel inside her head,
going around and around and around and
[SPEAKER_00]: around and around and around and around
and around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heated passions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilling effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here she is, acting tough again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning herself off fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curtains dropping in place, giving away
nothing, nothing, nothing in her eyes.
Oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
