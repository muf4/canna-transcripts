[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Conrad, author of Hemp Lifeline to
the Future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Chris back in the late 1980s when
the hemp industry was a distant dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris understood that somebody needed to
put together a trade organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before there were hempsters, we had the
Business Alliance for Commerce in Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how forward thinking Chris Conrad
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He decided that Jack's little pamphlet
needed to get big and go mainstream and
[SPEAKER_01]: became the editor of the Emperor Wears No
Clothes original edition and has continued
[SPEAKER_01]: on in his current voice as the West Coast
Leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody picked yourself up a copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great journal of what's really
going on out here and the whole country
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Conrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you a lot, Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Don is like a champion too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys being out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Don was saying though, what started
me on this whole thing, I've always worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with news media and with progressive
politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told by a group of progressive
activists that you could never change the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana laws, that we'd be stuck with
them as they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that knowledge is power and power
makes change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could create enough knowledge,
that would give people the power to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the change that was necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off by doing brochures and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Don mentioned, I quickly recognized
that I wanted to have a book out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came across a newspaper thing called The
Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me six months to get hold of Jack
Herrer and convince him that it was time
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it into a real book form and go
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We revised the book in 1990 and I started
writing my own things and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the periphery of the media for
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I was noticing was
I could influence the media to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: extent from where I was, but it was not
particularly satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, for example, when I got hold
of the Wall Street Journal and I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with them to put together an article about
hemp and how it was the coming wave of the
[SPEAKER_00]: future and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I arranged for them to do an interview
with Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a reporter walked in, Jack pulled out
a joint and started smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of doing a whole article on hemp,
they decided to do a personality piece on
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrer, the crusader for hemp who
smokes pot in front of reporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an interesting story, but it was
rather disappointing to me because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: not looking for a personality piece at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for something major,
which it kind of was, but it wasn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept doing events here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that if you wanted to do a press
conference, you wanted to get the media to
[SPEAKER_00]: show up, you promised them coffee and
donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a much higher rate of having them
show up than if you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one particular event that we
did where we had speakers coming from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the country to, I don't remember if
it was Sacramento or Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of news coverage,
a lot of cameras there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we watched the News Now report,
and they basically didn't really cover
[SPEAKER_00]: what any of the speakers said or what we
were about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went around the edges and they talked
to people who were saying, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what this is all about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who said, well, I don't think pop
should be legalized anyway, who happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to walk by in the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the news specifically ignored
what we had to say in order to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: people who looked like we didn't know what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience with the news media is that
I talk to them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get mentioned very often,
but I influence what happens in the
[SPEAKER_00]: articles and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way of getting some power out
of things, but we came to the conclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: that we wanted to do a little bit more
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people start magazines and
things just because they like the pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that people like to do the radio
shows, which I like to do, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the commitment to be there every week
to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got together with a guy named Richard
Lee, who's the founder of Oaks Dam
[SPEAKER_00]: University and another fellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put together the Oaks Dam News,
which was a quarterly newspaper from 2005
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were quite effective, except the thing
is we had a lot of different approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: because Richard didn't want us to put any
bad news in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted it to all be good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I think you just really can't
ignore the amount of bad news that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this perpetual little conflict
about how he cast all the articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, that was saved when our third
partner went off and took the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: bankrupted us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have to argue about that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, my wife, Mickey Norris,
it took me a year to convince her that we
[SPEAKER_00]: really needed to make progress with the
newspaper again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up with the West Coast Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we cover in every issue is that we
want to have articles from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, primarily on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have photos from all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to cover events all over,
but mainly what we're trying to do is to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread information about who's doing what,
what they're achieving, and how other
[SPEAKER_00]: people can do something similar in their
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to get involved with an
issue, who do they talk to, and how do
[SPEAKER_00]: they become activists?
[SPEAKER_00]: The function of our newspaper,
unlike most newspapers, which is to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you something to read over your coffee,
our function is to give you something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can then get pissed off enough about
that you decide to go home and do
[SPEAKER_00]: something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have very specific things that you can
do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the names of the people to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the name of the court ruling that
might affect your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the recent decisions that have
been happening on the state legislative
[SPEAKER_00]: level, on the national level, and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is extremely important
because, let me just take the case of
[SPEAKER_00]: Obama right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who feel very
disillusioned with Barack Obama as
[SPEAKER_00]: president.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said to me, well, he's the best
president that they'll let us have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if he was any better than that,
they would have killed him by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, whether that's true or not,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that a lot of people I talk
to are quite disillusioned with him,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yet, if you really follow what's going
on with Barack Obama on our issue in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, you find that he has delivered
in spades like no other president that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have ever had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obama came forward, yeah, he deserves a
big hand right now because whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's done elsewhere, a fight for the fact
that he's bringing the troops out of Iraq
[SPEAKER_00]: as he promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our issue in particular, first thing he
did soon after taking office was he
[SPEAKER_00]: announced that Eric Holder would be his
attorney general, and Eric Holder did a
[SPEAKER_00]: statement that we're going to follow the
promise to end the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, then the DEA raided a bunch
of places the next day to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't care what the president does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soon after that, they got the memo
on factual science, which said that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to use science instead of political
beliefs as a basis of their decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a huge threat to the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you were hearing, the DEA is,
they're using lies to keep marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The president has ordered them to have to
redo their work based upon scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The president then came back and issued a
memo saying that the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: does not have the right to preempt states
on criminal laws and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that in fact, the states should be
encouraged to diversify from the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: policies in order to create greater
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He quoted Supreme Court Justice Brandeis
that the states are a laboratory for
[SPEAKER_00]: democracy, and he brought that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he again told the government,
the DEA to leave us alone, and then still
[SPEAKER_00]: the rates continued, and then in October
of last year, he issued the memo which
[SPEAKER_00]: said specifically the DEA is supposed to
leave people alone in states who are
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant with the state medical marijuana
laws in their states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got this long track record,
and as you may have heard recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Veterans Administration has changed
their policy to allow veterans to use
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana in states where it's
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you thought George Bush would let that
happen, if you think John McCain would
[SPEAKER_00]: have let that happen, if you think Sarah
Palin would have let that happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got some rethinking to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we have to recognize
these things, and we have to be putting
[SPEAKER_00]: into the front because what the opposition
is trying to do is make us feel
[SPEAKER_00]: disillusioned with Obama and disillusioned
with the Democrats so that we let the
[SPEAKER_00]: Republicans come back and take power
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking this from a partisan point
of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it from the point of view of
who has delivered what that does good for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who came through with the healthcare
program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who came through with these decisions
about allowing for medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who came through for us over and over
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's pulling us out of Iraq?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Democrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the people to say all
politicians are alike is the same as to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall into the lies of being put forth by
Rupert Murdoch and that spewing not as a
[SPEAKER_00]: factory known as Fox News.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have a similar issue when it comes
to the West Coast leaf, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage everyone to take a copy,
which is that we have a situation in
[SPEAKER_00]: California right now over Prop 19 where
some people who are making money off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the current situation like to project it
that somehow there's something so terribly
[SPEAKER_00]: flawed about Prop 19 that we, even though
we use marijuana, should be voting against
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this is based upon one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a guy named Dennis Perrone,
good friend of mine, who decided to take
[SPEAKER_00]: it upon himself to spread false
information about the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because he was so known within the
medical marijuana circles, people just
[SPEAKER_00]: believed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it's gotten into the New
York, excuse me, the Los Angeles Times and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gotten into the Sacramento News that
this law will create new felonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely factually a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is false information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the news media, because Dennis
Perrone, who is their hero of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, is saying it, they don't reject
and read the initiative to find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: it really says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that people say
to us, oh, we should get both sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: argument, well, I'll tell you what,
we do not publish lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of people publishing lies
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get the government's side
of lies about the initiative, you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: any other newspaper and they will tell you
the government's lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our job is to screen it out and make sure
that what you're getting is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're not going to get Dennis
Perrone's fake idea of what the initiative
[SPEAKER_00]: does when you read the West Coast League.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find out what the
initiative really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you read our newspaper, if we make a
mistake, we're going to come back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next issue and clean it up and let you
know what that mistake was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to feed you a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then your question is, how do you
benefit from the work that we're willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to put in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You write us an article that tells us what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it with a news book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give us a good photograph that shows
us something going on and a nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: caption that explains it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to write in good,
plain English.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about a direct declaratory
sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start off with somebody did
something important and this is why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did it on such of a date and
where they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want, October the 5th was a
historic day for people all over the world
[SPEAKER_00]: who like to smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, hello, I want to know
what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day is a historic day because the
next day is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that it's a historic day that's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to know is what really
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, I know people like to write
stuff in very roundabout couched ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to say the more specific,
the more direct, the more clear you can
[SPEAKER_00]: be, the more likely you are to get your
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get into our hands, we're going to
put it out 150,000 plus copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get spread all around the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other publications read ours and then
they cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the story about the airports
in California that don't, that'll let
[SPEAKER_00]: people fly with medical marijuana now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the ones who broke that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, we wrote one story about a
guy who had been framed by the cops and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cop who was, we've said was involved
in framing him, then went and helped the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy get out so that he would not be,
so that people would not think he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad guy because his people read in the
West Coast leaf that he was being an
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told him that he was being an
asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually went and helped out the
guy that we had reported that he had
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I didn't really mean for that
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the power is right here and
we get the information from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to stop, but please keep
giving us your articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure that they get out
to the rest of the world and we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that they get the true story,
not the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chris Conrad.
Thank you.
