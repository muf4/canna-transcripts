[SPEAKER_16]: So, good evening everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for coming out tonight.
[SPEAKER_16]: My name's Rob Patridge and I'm the chair
of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're happy to host these meetings.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is meeting number nine,
or eight of the, what, number nine is
[SPEAKER_16]: tomorrow, so eight of these meetings.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've seen almost 2,000 people face to
face from all around Oregon.
[SPEAKER_16]: The commission is happy to sponsor these
events, to get out and have an informal
[SPEAKER_16]: discussion to see what's going on around
the state.
[SPEAKER_16]: To learn about your thoughts related to
Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're really trying to focus our
conversation on hearing from Oregonians
[SPEAKER_16]: about those things that we can control at
the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't control the taxes.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't control things like, we don't
control the taxes, we don't control where
[SPEAKER_16]: the money's gonna go.
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of those kinds of things we'll
continue to get questions about.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll try to redirect those questions.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we may cut you off on occasion,
but we don't wanna cut you off because we
[SPEAKER_16]: don't wanna hear from you.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're gonna cut you off so we can
focus on those things like marketing,
[SPEAKER_16]: packaging, how you're gonna obtain your
license, how all those things are gonna
[SPEAKER_16]: work.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those things that we as members of the
OLCC can really affect.
[SPEAKER_16]: This was a measure that was passed by
Oregon voters.
[SPEAKER_16]: 56% of the people said yes, 44% said no.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I've told people in every single
one of these sessions, I voted no on
[SPEAKER_16]: Measure 94.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm very clear and open about it,
and I've made no bones about it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm also the chair of the commission.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as the chair of the commission,
I have a responsibility to put this
[SPEAKER_16]: measure into place in the right manner and
in a safe and responsible manner for
[SPEAKER_16]: Oregonians.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not here to step on the air hoses.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not here to do those things.
[SPEAKER_16]: The voters have spoken.
[SPEAKER_16]: So now's our time to make sure that it's
done the right way.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I want you all to be respectful of
each other as we continue to move forward.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're here to gain information from you,
and we're here to gain information from
[SPEAKER_16]: all sides.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the measure has been settled,
and we're trying to get, solicit those
[SPEAKER_16]: responses from people about now how to put
it in place.
[SPEAKER_16]: So let me give you the basics related to
Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_16]: The measure was approved by voters in
November of 2014.
[SPEAKER_16]: It gives OLCC, these five commissioners,
the authority to tax, license,
[SPEAKER_16]: and regulate marijuana in the state of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_16]: There are four license types that were
allowed under the measure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those license types include the producer
or growers license, the processor license,
[SPEAKER_16]: a wholesaler's license, and a retail
license.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are only four specific types of
licenses that were allowed in the measure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Licensees can hold multiple types of
licenses.
[SPEAKER_16]: Unlike alcohol, where you can't,
except maybe if you're like a brew pub or
[SPEAKER_16]: something, you don't get to produce,
distribute, and retail the alcohol,
generally.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, the rest of the basics.
[SPEAKER_16]: The excise tax in Oregon is paid at the
grower level.
[SPEAKER_16]: Unlike Colorado and Washington,
which have taxes at multiple levels,
[SPEAKER_16]: the tax in the state of Oregon is paid
only at the grower level.
[SPEAKER_16]: The net revenue distribution is not
decided by the OLCC.
[SPEAKER_16]: It can be changed by the Oregon
legislature, but this is what Oregonians
[SPEAKER_16]: voted for in the measure.
[SPEAKER_16]: 40% to the common school fund,
20% to mental health alcoholism and drug
[SPEAKER_16]: services, 15% to the state police,
10% to cities for law enforcement of this
[SPEAKER_16]: measure, 10% to counties for law
enforcement of this measure, 5% to the
[SPEAKER_16]: Oregon Health Authority for alcohol and
drug abuse prevention.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those were included in the measure that
Oregonians voted on.
[SPEAKER_16]: The act does not affect the Oregon medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_16]: While there has been much debate related
to the Oregon medical marijuana program
[SPEAKER_16]: and whether these programs should be
combined and those kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_16]: the OLCC has no authority to act to
combine programs or affect the Oregon
[SPEAKER_16]: medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some synergies in the program that
we're interested in as the OLCC,
[SPEAKER_16]: and we have some, probably we'll have some
recommendations related to the
[SPEAKER_16]: legislature, and we'll talk about some of
those things later.
[SPEAKER_16]: But just so people are clear on where
we're at with the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_16]: program.
[SPEAKER_16]: We will ask you some questions related to
the medical marijuana program and the
[SPEAKER_16]: measure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Not because we have any effect over that,
but because the legislature knows that
[SPEAKER_16]: we're out here talking to Oregonians and
they want our feedback as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're using us as a sounding board of
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_16]: The act allows the homegrown of up to four
plants and eight ounces per resident
[SPEAKER_16]: beginning July 1st, 2015.
[SPEAKER_16]: The OLCC has no control over the homegrown
provisions.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't regulate the homegrown
provisions.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's nothing in the act that provides
our ability to regulate those provisions.
[SPEAKER_16]: The act prohibits consumption in public.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't smoke in public.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't take marijuana in public.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't eat brownies in public.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't eat edibles in public.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't do any of those things in a
public area, okay?
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no provision for lounges or bars
or those kinds of things for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: The act does not allow local governments
to tax marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that there are over 100 local
jurisdictions in the state who have passed
[SPEAKER_16]: measures that are interested in taxing
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: The OLCC does not get to decide whether
those local jurisdictions can tax
[SPEAKER_16]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: That is something to be worked out either
in the legislature or that's something to
[SPEAKER_16]: be worked out in the court system.
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, the OLCC is not going to talk
about the taxes.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have anything to do with that tax
level.
[SPEAKER_16]: Localities may opt out through general
election.
[SPEAKER_16]: If 10% of the voters in a given
jurisdiction in the city or county sign
[SPEAKER_16]: up, put it on the ballot, they can opt out
of having licensees in their jurisdiction,
[SPEAKER_16]: all right?
[SPEAKER_16]: It still allows the homegrown personal use
and those kinds of things, but they can
[SPEAKER_16]: opt out.
[SPEAKER_16]: What many people don't know is that you
can also opt out of liquor, though we
[SPEAKER_16]: don't have cities and counties in the
state of Oregon who have opted out of
[SPEAKER_16]: liquor.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's just a fun fact.
[SPEAKER_16]: Federal considerations.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have federal considerations related to
this, and you're all aware of this,
[SPEAKER_16]: and the OLCC is very aware of this.
[SPEAKER_16]: Marijuana remains illegal under federal
law, all right?
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a business risk, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: So we just point that out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: However, on August 29, 2013, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_16]: Department of Justice issued guidance to
the states that have legalized
[SPEAKER_16]: recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: They issued guidance under what is called
the Cole Memorandum, C-O-L-E.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the Cole Memorandum provides the
guidance to states that are putting
[SPEAKER_16]: recreational marijuana into effect.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Cole Memorandum doesn't have the force
of law.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's merely an opinion of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_16]: Attorney's Office under the current
administration.
[SPEAKER_16]: Administration to administration could
change that, so it doesn't have the force
[SPEAKER_16]: of law.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you'd like to look at the Cole
Memorandum in its original form,
[SPEAKER_16]: go to marijuana.oregon.gov, and you can
download or look at online the Cole
[SPEAKER_16]: Memorandum, okay?
[SPEAKER_16]: Federal guidance.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the main points of the Cole
Memorandum.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the main points of the Cole Memorandum
are to one, prevent the distribution of
[SPEAKER_16]: marijuana to minors.
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, prevent revenue from the sale of
marijuana from going to criminal
[SPEAKER_16]: enterprises, gangs, and cartels.
[SPEAKER_16]: Three, prevent the diversion of marijuana
from where it is legal under state law to
[SPEAKER_16]: other states.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we don't want it going out of state,
no interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_16]: Four, prevent state authorized activity
from being used as a cover for illegal
[SPEAKER_16]: activity.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't want to be growing things in the
recreational market and then, la la la,
[SPEAKER_16]: all of a sudden they're all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what they don't want to happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Five, prevent violence and the use of
firearms and the cultivation and
[SPEAKER_16]: distribution of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: Six, prevent drug driving and other
adverse public health consequences
[SPEAKER_16]: associated with marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven, prevent the growing of marijuana on
public land.
[SPEAKER_16]: Eight, prevent marijuana use on public
property.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the eight kind of principle
points of what the Cole Memorandum says,
[SPEAKER_16]: but again, go to marijuana.oregon.gov to
take a look at the original by yourself.
[SPEAKER_16]: In order to meet the precepts of those
eight points from the Cole Memorandum,
[SPEAKER_16]: both Colorado and Washington and the state
of Oregon is now looking at right now and
[SPEAKER_16]: in the process of preparing a request for
proposal for a seed to sale tracking
[SPEAKER_16]: system.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't feel that we can comply with
federal law without having a seed to sale
[SPEAKER_16]: tracking system, all right?
[SPEAKER_16]: I already said Colorado and Washington
require it and the reason they require it
[SPEAKER_16]: is so the taxes are cold properly
collected and that the inventory does not
[SPEAKER_16]: migrate from the residential market into a
black or gray market.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the reason we have the seed to
sale tracking system.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's designed for more effective audits
and to satisfy federal guidelines.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also for efficiency.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't have people go into every
recreational marijuana grove and whatever
[SPEAKER_16]: and, you know, individually counting every
single plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'd have a fleet of auditors.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to be able to go through and with
a wand with RFID tags and be able to say
[SPEAKER_16]: how many plants are here and what's going
on and are they properly where they're
[SPEAKER_16]: supposed to be and those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's for efficiency not only for us but
for the operations and that's what they do
[SPEAKER_16]: in a lot of the manufacturing industries
today.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we mentioned before there are only four
license types that were allowed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those four license types, while we have
more for alcohol, they're very restrictive
[SPEAKER_16]: in what they do.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first type of license is a producer
license.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's only able to cultivate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's responsible for the payment of tax at
the first point of sale.
[SPEAKER_16]: So for example, the Commission had an
educational session today.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to make some recommendations
to the legislature.
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things that we see as a
potential deficit on the producer license
[SPEAKER_16]: is we don't have to be able to have this,
you know, kind of farm to table kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: thing that we have on the food products
industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Under the way that Measure 91 was written,
you can't be a grower.
[SPEAKER_16]: Package it for retail and sell it directly
to a retailer.
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got to have two licenses.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that doesn't seem to make a lot of
sense to some of us.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that's something the legislature
would have to change but it's something
[SPEAKER_16]: that we as the Commissioner are trying to
look at.
[SPEAKER_16]: The processor license.
[SPEAKER_16]: The processor license packages and labels
marijuana items, okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also it would be the, you'd have to get
this kind of license to manufacture
[SPEAKER_16]: edibles and extracts, okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to that we have a wholesale
license.
[SPEAKER_16]: Those people that buy and sell at
wholesale.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this isn't a required license but as
markets mature, wholesalers come in.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that license is anticipated by the
measure.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the fourth and final license is the
retail license.
[SPEAKER_16]: It sells marijuana items at retail to
adults over 21 years old.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the retailer.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the person who's doing it.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the one who sets up the shops.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but there are other licenses that the
OCC is considering asking the legislature
[SPEAKER_16]: about doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, one of the things is testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: We want, we're interested in having
testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you were a testing facility there's
no way to get licensed to be able to hold
[SPEAKER_16]: the marijuana out of the recreational
system.
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are some of the tweaks and things
that as the OCC does its work and as we
[SPEAKER_16]: work with the industry and we work with
everyone to understand when we work with
[SPEAKER_16]: local government, law enforcement,
those are all the things that we want to
[SPEAKER_16]: make sure in the system so that when your
product's being transported from your
[SPEAKER_16]: facility to the test facility that it's in
this seed to sale tracking system so if
[SPEAKER_16]: somebody gets pulled over by law
enforcement or something else happens,
[SPEAKER_16]: you have a manifest that's clear where it
started, where it's gone, where it's
[SPEAKER_16]: going, and the plan through the system.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why we're doing what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're doing it for everybody's protection
and transparency in the system.
[SPEAKER_16]: Advertising, packaging, and testing.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is going to be probably one of the
biggest and hottest areas related to where
[SPEAKER_16]: the OCC is.
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's going to be involved.
[SPEAKER_16]: The act gives us the authority to regulate
or prohibit advertising.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can regulate packages and labels to
ensure public safety and prevent an appeal
[SPEAKER_16]: to minors.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we can adopt standards and testing
requirements.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is an area where we're a new
ground really.
[SPEAKER_16]: We regulate alcohol.
[SPEAKER_16]: Alcohol is a federal, it's regulated at
the federal level.
[SPEAKER_16]: It all falls under the federal
constitution.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the rules are kind of clear.
[SPEAKER_16]: OCC, for example, we don't approve any of
the beer and wine and alcohol labels.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all done at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we don't have the internal
infrastructure at the OCC or the train
[SPEAKER_16]: staff who's familiar with those kind of
processes currently.
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are some of the things where
we're going to be able to be seeking a lot
[SPEAKER_16]: of public input related to those types of
items.
[SPEAKER_16]: Impaired driving.
[SPEAKER_16]: The act does not identify a specific limit
for driving.
[SPEAKER_16]: A blood level limit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Both Washington and Colorado in their
original measure passed a blood level
[SPEAKER_16]: limit for impaired driving.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oregon does not have that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I can tell you as a DA, we prosecute
people on a regular basis all around the
[SPEAKER_16]: state for drug driving.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we currently have a system in place to
deal with drug driving around the state.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the act does require the OCC to
examine research and present a report to
[SPEAKER_16]: the legislature related to impaired
driving in the state of Oregon related to
[SPEAKER_16]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: So what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_16]: We're working with the Department of
Justice, Investigation Division,
[SPEAKER_16]: and the Oregon State Police to gather the
data together to present that report.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're trying to work with everybody,
local government.
[SPEAKER_16]: But the state police is really the main
place where all that information is
[SPEAKER_16]: gathered.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're charged with that data
collection and implementation.
[SPEAKER_16]: So many people have asked what's the
timeline for implementation.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think you've all seen stories coming
out of Washington and Colorado related to
[SPEAKER_16]: those things.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to be very transparent with
the public about what their expectations
[SPEAKER_16]: are.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to keep within the spirit.
[SPEAKER_16]: This group is certainly very much into
keeping into the spirit of the measure and
[SPEAKER_16]: keeping into the timelines.
[SPEAKER_16]: But our commission also acknowledges the
fact that when Oregonians signed up and
[SPEAKER_16]: put their signatures on the initiative
measure to get measure 91 on the ballot,
[SPEAKER_16]: we also didn't have the experience of
having two states legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we also feel like we would be remiss as
a commission.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the legislature feels the same
way, that we would be remiss if we didn't
[SPEAKER_16]: learn from what's been fared out in both
Colorado and Washington.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we want to keep with the spirit of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're going to go slow.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to do it in Oregon's way.
[SPEAKER_16]: Every single one of these states is
different.
[SPEAKER_16]: January 1, 2015, personal possession and
home production become legal in the state
[SPEAKER_16]: of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, that was in the measure.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what's happening with personal
possession and home production.
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, the OCC does not regulate personal
possession and home production.
[SPEAKER_16]: March through 2015, we will begin to
notice rulemaking.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're probably only going to be able to
put these rules in on a temporary basis
[SPEAKER_16]: just because of the timelines to hit our
January deadline, with ultimately a final
[SPEAKER_16]: rules package coming forward.
[SPEAKER_16]: But through March through October 2015,
there will be plenty of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_16]: What we're going to do is we're going to
draft a set of rules.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to get an advisory group.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll go through more detail later.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's what we're doing is rulemaking
March through October.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our hope is that by November of 2015,
we will have a temporary rules package in
[SPEAKER_16]: place so that we can begin to tilt up the
system.
[SPEAKER_16]: January 4, 2016, this measure requires us
to, as the OCC, to begin accepting
[SPEAKER_16]: applications for licenses.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what it requires is January 4,
2016.
[SPEAKER_16]: But what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_16]: That means we've got to start accepting
applications for licenses.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that doesn't mean that you're going to
be able to walk into a retail
[SPEAKER_16]: establishment and buy marijuana across the
counter January 4, 2016.
[SPEAKER_16]: So late in 2016 is when we believe retail
sales will begin.
[SPEAKER_16]: Why do we believe that?
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think people watched what happened
in the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_16]: They had this huge spike because there
wasn't enough product in the market.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there was huge costs.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it's flattened out.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's done all kinds of crazy things.
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember, this is an industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, nobody on the commission does not
believe we have a mature marijuana
[SPEAKER_16]: industry in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_16]: We certainly do.
[SPEAKER_16]: We certainly have a brand and a
reputation.
[SPEAKER_16]: Worldwide, related to the marijuana that's
grown in the state.
[SPEAKER_16]: That marijuana cannot come immediately
into the retail system.
[SPEAKER_16]: It has to be grown in the retail system
and tracked in the seed to sale system.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's got to be a harvest cycle.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's got to be processing and packaging
approval.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then retail stores can come online.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why we're saying, realistically,
late in 2016 is when we believe something
[SPEAKER_16]: will begin to come online.
[SPEAKER_16]: We also intend to process those
applications in the order of growers,
[SPEAKER_16]: and then producers, and then retailers.
[SPEAKER_16]: We certainly are trying to do that so that
we can be efficient, so that we don't have
[SPEAKER_16]: some of the same pitfalls of Washington
and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Public engagement.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're obviously publicly engaged.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have a listening tour.
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I can't stress enough.
[SPEAKER_16]: How many people have gone to marijuana
.oregon.gov?
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, if you haven't, take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_16]: OK?
[SPEAKER_16]: Volunteers with expertise in the range of
issues related to Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to appoint a Rules Advisory
Commission to do that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to include law enforcement
sheriffs, chiefs, DAs, local governments,
[SPEAKER_16]: cities and counties, from industry,
growers, processors, testing, kitchen
[SPEAKER_16]: people in retail, the proponents of
Measure 91, and three other members of the
[SPEAKER_16]: public.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of our intent.
[SPEAKER_18]: So at this point, we usually take a few
questions that are really focused on
[SPEAKER_18]: clarifying.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not discussion-oriented.
[SPEAKER_18]: I promise you we're going to have time for
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I've got a question on the board
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have a DA, a real estate agent,
an insurance agent.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see no conflict of interest with going
ahead and setting these laws?
[SPEAKER_11]: In your case, perhaps prosecuting them?
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds like discussion to be.
[SPEAKER_18]: But go ahead and answer it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you guys keep with clarifying
right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: I personally don't see a conflict of
interest.
[SPEAKER_16]: These are recreational marijuana laws and
rules that we're putting in place.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see the insurance guy is having a
conflict.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have no direct financial interest in
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they will be stopped from,
let's say, selling real estate to people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the person that does sell real estate,
and they will be stopped from having lists
[SPEAKER_11]: of people they can get insurance from?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have any direct financial
interest.
[SPEAKER_19]: But they will.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned that you'll be working with
the industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a growers' association involved?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is there a nonprofit organization that
represents a growers' association,
[SPEAKER_11]: like the wine industry, the nursery
industry?
[SPEAKER_16]: There are several grower groups around the
state.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had several of them testify.
[SPEAKER_16]: As invited testimony before our
commission, as well as the legislative
[SPEAKER_16]: committee, most of those are private
groups.
[SPEAKER_16]: The beer people and the wine people have
something in statute.
[SPEAKER_16]: The craft distilling industry is asking
for something in statute at this time.
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point in time, no marijuana does
not have anything in place at that kind of
[SPEAKER_16]: state level.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I know that there are loose groups of
growers around the state that are
[SPEAKER_16]: organized.
[SPEAKER_16]: That we've been reaching out to that are
identifiable and have also reached out to
[SPEAKER_16]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you stated that these possible new
rules and legislature won't affect the LMP
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want to clarify, specifically
on House Bill 2040, that bans marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses within one mile radius of
schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will have no effect on the LMP
program for, say, existing grow sites?
[SPEAKER_16]: What I would tell you is I don't know
anything about that particular piece of
[SPEAKER_16]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_16]: The commission is really focused on,
we don't have any control over the OMMP.
[SPEAKER_16]: The only people that could affect that is
the Oregon legislature.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're right to look at those bills.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have any control over those
bills.
[SPEAKER_29]: My question is on the impaired driving
statutes.
[SPEAKER_29]: Some of us are trying to produce products
that have zero THC in them.
[SPEAKER_29]: And that is essentially for those who are
possibly drivers, and those who are
[SPEAKER_29]: possibly children.
[SPEAKER_29]: And how does that affect those folks that
there is no THC, which I believe that's
[SPEAKER_29]: the active ingredient in there.
[SPEAKER_29]: So if there are only CBDs and stuff that
helps seizures on the grand mal epileptic.
[SPEAKER_29]: So we would like to be able to control
those things and not get high.
[SPEAKER_29]: And so are you folks setting up some form
of clarification on that?
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm sure there's a lot of- Well,
most of those are under the Oregon medical
[SPEAKER_16]: marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_16]: Recreational marijuana cannot be given to
children at all.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's those over the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_16]: So most of that will be housed in the
medical marijuana program, which again,
[SPEAKER_16]: we have no regulatory oversight or ability
to control that.
[SPEAKER_30]: How many people are going to be on that
rules advisory committee?
[SPEAKER_30]: And if that's determined legislatively,
or if that's something that you guys have
[SPEAKER_30]: within your power to determine?
[SPEAKER_16]: So the rules advisory committee is at the
commission level.
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be director appointed, at least
planned at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had the discussion today.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're waiting to hear back from staff
tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_16]: The pitch today was having about 13
members on that committee.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's through the OLCC.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there's a plan to do a bunch of
subcommittees underneath that,
[SPEAKER_16]: especially to get some really specific
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_18]: Should there be restrictions on where
marijuana businesses can operate?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: There should be restrictions on where they
can operate.
[SPEAKER_18]: Red, no.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Largely green, but it's mixed.
[SPEAKER_18]: There are reds and a few yellows scattered
within there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we've heard from some of these
jurisdictions is that we don't control
[SPEAKER_09]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the jurisdictions have asked
the legislature to take a look at allowing
[SPEAKER_09]: them to maintain home rule, because each
of us lives someplace else.
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the concern is that from the
state level, we'll start telling the
[SPEAKER_09]: cities and the counties how to run their
communities.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's where that question kind of
came from.
[SPEAKER_18]: Should retail outlets be allowed to
co-locate with medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_18]: dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_18]: Should they be allowed to co-locate with
medical marijuana dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_18]: Very predominantly green, but let's,
this gentleman wants to speak.
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand the co-mingling of both
medical and recreational, but I feel the
[SPEAKER_10]: problem is medical got such a head start
on recreational.
[SPEAKER_10]: For people that are already owning medical
dispensaries, they have an unfair
[SPEAKER_10]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for the people on the recreational
side, you have to adhere by a different
[SPEAKER_10]: set of rules.
[SPEAKER_10]: And finding those limited spaces that are
still available is becoming harder and
[SPEAKER_10]: harder, because if it's the same
regulation of a thousand people in a
[SPEAKER_10]: school, another dispensary, you're not
getting the same platform success.
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the main concerns was already
brought up, which is regulation.
[SPEAKER_24]: Law enforcement wants one system to audit.
[SPEAKER_24]: We've heard them say that over and over.
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's something that you're going to
have to consider from their perspective.
[SPEAKER_24]: OLCC probably, they're not going to tell
you right now, but they probably feel the
[SPEAKER_24]: same way.
[SPEAKER_24]: They want one system to audit.
[SPEAKER_24]: And beyond that, I think that if you're
going to have thousand foot from each
[SPEAKER_24]: other buffers, where are you going to put
a recreational store in Portland?
[SPEAKER_24]: Nowhere.
[SPEAKER_24]: There's 117 dispensaries in Portland out
of 225 in the state.
[SPEAKER_24]: At least 110 of them are licensed.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: So should there be, should there be a
server type of permit in marijuana,
[SPEAKER_16]: just like there is an alcohol?
[SPEAKER_16]: Green?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Red?
[SPEAKER_16]: No.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yellow?
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: So Tom, you've got somebody.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm opposed to having them have a
permitting process and having another fee
[SPEAKER_22]: to the recreational system before it
starts.
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, the real issue that we're
looking at is serving underage people.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's really the only concern in
terms of the training at this point.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's the only thing we have research
to back up or anything to go on forward
[SPEAKER_22]: with.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I already heard the commission talk
about implementing a potential card check
[SPEAKER_22]: measure against people who are found
violating and serving underage people.
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's already a policy where they can
hand down some consequences in terms of
[SPEAKER_22]: people who are breaking the law and
serving minors.
[SPEAKER_22]: And beyond that, there's really not any
sort of standard set or any sort of
[SPEAKER_22]: information to create this test that bud
tenders are supposed to pass.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it just really doesn't serve any
greater purpose, I guess.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there are a number of concerns
about getting marijuana served to me as a
[SPEAKER_15]: consumer beyond just whether or not my
gray hair says that I'm too old or too
[SPEAKER_15]: young for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to know that the person that's
grabbing that bud has washed their hands.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they wearing a glove?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they know the difference between indica
and sativa?
[SPEAKER_15]: They have any idea what concentrates are?
[SPEAKER_15]: How long to wait for a cookie to kick in?
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a lot of concerns.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to make sure that the people
that are serving, especially the new
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis consumers that will be coming
into and the tourists, we don't want to
[SPEAKER_15]: have bad headlines like they had in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's make sure that our servers are
licensed and trained.
[SPEAKER_26]: Please don't confuse being served in a bar
with buying recreational weed.
[SPEAKER_18]: Should there be limits on the size of
commercial marijuana grow operations?
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's number of plants or canopy yet
to be determined.
[SPEAKER_18]: But should there be some sort of limits on
the size of the grow operation?
[SPEAKER_18]: Mostly red, mixed, but mostly red.
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say more red than green.
[SPEAKER_25]: Similar to farming, I grew up on a farm
where we weren't limited by how much corn
[SPEAKER_25]: you could grow.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's also lots of small farmers.
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not limited on their size.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of farmers that are big in
this state.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of farmers that are small.
[SPEAKER_25]: And it shouldn't be limited to,
you can only grow five corn plants or
[SPEAKER_25]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_25]: It should just be based on the regulations
in place and the rules.
[SPEAKER_25]: As long as you're meeting that,
you can do what you want.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have no idea how many users of
recreational marijuana are going to be in
[SPEAKER_14]: this state.
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, we have no idea.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too early to put that into place and
how large a grow operation needs to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: The grow operation will serve the clients
that they sell to, and there's no way for
[SPEAKER_14]: us to know exactly what that will look
like.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we put a restriction on it now,
that will limit the size of businesses,
[SPEAKER_14]: it will limit the number of people that
they can serve, and so on.
[SPEAKER_18]: Should there be different requirements for
indoor and outdoor grow operations?
[SPEAKER_18]: Should there be different requirements?
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, really mixed.
[SPEAKER_18]: And a lot of yellows.
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it important that marijuana growers
have a security system?
[SPEAKER_18]: Should they have a security system?
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, a lot of greens, mostly greens.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's one of the things when we ask
the first question, that's one of the
[SPEAKER_18]: things a lot of the audience would talk
about is the different requirements for
[SPEAKER_18]: security with an indoor versus an outdoor.
[SPEAKER_18]: You have a couple of follow-up questions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so one of the big questions we've
had and one of the questions that's going
[SPEAKER_16]: to be on our mind as we prepare to put
rules into place.
[SPEAKER_16]: How many people think that video
surveillance systems should be required on
[SPEAKER_16]: any marijuana grow?
[SPEAKER_16]: Video surveillance.
[SPEAKER_16]: At the grow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then you should have a recorded
video surveillance system.
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's a lot of reds, it's really
mixed, which is the issue of testing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So should the OLCC require testing of
recreational marijuana for things such as
[SPEAKER_18]: potency, pesticides, and molds?
[SPEAKER_18]: Should there be a requirement for testing?
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's pretty overwhelmingly green.
[SPEAKER_16]: How many people would be in favor of
requiring that the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_16]: program adopt the same testing standard as
the recreational program?
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that too is overwhelmingly green.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something we're talking to the
legislature about, so we appreciate your
[SPEAKER_16]: input on that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Does that mean we're going to standardize
the actual labs themselves?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we'll standardize the labs and the
lab testing.
[SPEAKER_18]: The fellow up here, the question he asked
is will the labs be standardized?
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a lot of what we've heard is
that you're getting, those of you who are
[SPEAKER_18]: having your product tested are getting
really different results depending on the
[SPEAKER_18]: labs, and I'm seeing that it's not.
[SPEAKER_18]: Should edible recreational marijuana
products be available?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_18]: So should edible recreational marijuana
packages contain information on dosage and
[SPEAKER_18]: serving sizes?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Simple.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: So should we prohibit recreational
marijuana products that may be appealing
[SPEAKER_18]: to children?
[SPEAKER_18]: This is where, yeah, we get more mixed on
this one.
[SPEAKER_18]: Should there be standards for what's
required on labels?
[SPEAKER_18]: Like there is on food, you know,
and you know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_18]: So should there be standards set for
what's required on the labels?
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's overwhelmingly green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks guys for having this meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the statute in Measure 91 says
there's not going to be the public use
[SPEAKER_03]: cafes scenarios.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is specifically, is there
going to be any kind of involvement for a
[SPEAKER_03]: private club style scenario?
[SPEAKER_16]: So the OSCC, we don't believe currently
has the licensing ability or regulatory
[SPEAKER_16]: authority to have a license for a club
oriented business.
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would be something the Oregon
legislature would have to tackle.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you're interested in that,
you'd have to talk to the legislature.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Russ Melville.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the executive director of Portland
Normal.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank you for having these
listening sessions.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would encourage you as the Liquor
Control Commission in the gray areas where
[SPEAKER_15]: it isn't specifically dictated by Measure
91 that an operating principle should be,
[SPEAKER_15]: what do we do with alcohol?
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we have questions like how big or
how much should people be able to grow in
[SPEAKER_15]: a commercial setting?
[SPEAKER_15]: How much can they brew at Widmer?
[SPEAKER_15]: How much can they brew at McManamance?
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a limit on them?
[SPEAKER_15]: If there is, apply it to us.
[SPEAKER_15]: When we're talking about serving,
we're talking about retail licensing,
[SPEAKER_15]: we're talking about packaging,
I don't think these questions are too hard
[SPEAKER_15]: to answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've already answered them with the most
deadly dangerous drug there is,
[SPEAKER_15]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_15]: Apply that reasoning to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Jeff Musil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And kind of a response to that,
I think there needs to be a strong focus
[SPEAKER_08]: on limits on growing precisely because,
as someone mentioned, there's no limits on
[SPEAKER_08]: corn plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this isn't a corn plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a specific niche product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Oregon's distilling and brewing
industries have become the high points of
[SPEAKER_08]: the national scene that they are by
letting niche markets grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if this is turned into something where
1,000 acre farms can produce tons,
[SPEAKER_08]: then the local growers isn't going to have
a place to compete.
[SPEAKER_08]: So will there be a focus and emphasis on
letting small businesses become part of
[SPEAKER_08]: the scene?
[SPEAKER_31]: I wanted to provide my perspective on just
three quick issues, and you don't need to
[SPEAKER_31]: respond, I just wanted to say it.
[SPEAKER_31]: So one is that everything that you guys
are doing, please do it with the mind of
[SPEAKER_31]: encouraging this industry and not
restricting or reducing it because we're
[SPEAKER_31]: at a stage right now where we really want
to grow this industry.
[SPEAKER_31]: So with the exception of the necessary
restrictions, we want to avoid any
[SPEAKER_31]: unnecessary hindrances on the industry.
[SPEAKER_31]: The second thing is when it comes to kids,
I think we shouldn't be irrational or
[SPEAKER_31]: overblow the issue.
[SPEAKER_31]: Kids have access to marijuana today.
[SPEAKER_31]: They've had access for marijuana 50 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think that putting bright colors
on the label are going to make more kids
[SPEAKER_31]: smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think we need to worry about that,
especially when we're looking at them
[SPEAKER_31]: being available in adult only stores.
[SPEAKER_31]: So don't get blown away by this idea of
protecting our children.
[SPEAKER_31]: We've already established rules and limits
that take that into account.
[SPEAKER_31]: And then the final thing is with regards
to the limitations on the plants,
[SPEAKER_31]: canopies, acreage, whatever, I think that
we need to take into account that we want
[SPEAKER_31]: to encourage economies of scale,
cost savings, energy efficiencies,
[SPEAKER_31]: and things like this, and not put
unnecessary restrictions that require us
[SPEAKER_31]: to do things that require excessive energy
or that require excessive costs that would
[SPEAKER_31]: be a burden on the industry.
[SPEAKER_31]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Jackson LaForme.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a dispensary owner, and I wanted to
talk about colocation and a couple ways to
[SPEAKER_22]: address that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the testing standard is a huge way
to address that.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think the Oregon Health Authority
would be pressured heavily by myself and
[SPEAKER_22]: other dispensary owners to have labs adopt
a standard, because as you said,
[SPEAKER_22]: we've all experienced here the issue with
testing drastically differently between
[SPEAKER_22]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that would solve the biggest issue
of colocation, where the marijuana program
[SPEAKER_22]: already requires customer-specific
historical purchase information to be kept
[SPEAKER_22]: on site.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's more regulation than we're going to
be requiring in the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_22]: I also don't think the seed-to-sale aspect
is really that influential.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think people are rushing to be
regulated and pay taxes and then are going
[SPEAKER_22]: to sell their product in the black market
or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that slows down the process of the
recreational market hammering down the
[SPEAKER_22]: black market and eliminating it
completely, because if we create a safe
[SPEAKER_22]: access and a legal access that pays good
taxes, people are going to be interested
[SPEAKER_22]: in it.
[SPEAKER_22]: And all of the estimates so far indicate
that the purchase price in Oregon is going
[SPEAKER_22]: to be ridiculously low.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just really don't see the intense
focus on the seed-to-sale aspect of that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a comment about the limiting of the
acreage or whatever for growers.
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel it should be limited because you're
going to have a millionaire farmer out in
[SPEAKER_17]: Eastern Oregon with $6,000 acres,
and then you're going to have a small
[SPEAKER_17]: person down in Eugene with only two acres.
[SPEAKER_17]: It really will help to limit it because
the small businesses will then have an
[SPEAKER_17]: opportunity to thrive.
[SPEAKER_17]: My other question is, there is an open
container law for driving.
[SPEAKER_17]: Will there be an open pipe law or
whatever?
[SPEAKER_16]: So currently there is no open container
law like there is in alcohol.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there is a strong interest and the
commission addressed that today as one of
[SPEAKER_16]: the items that the legislature needs to
take a look at so that we can have
[SPEAKER_16]: clarification.
[SPEAKER_17]: Personal use is kind of a gray area.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we're well aware of the issues.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my personal space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an assessment and a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: An assessment is that this industry is in
its real infancy right now, and putting
[SPEAKER_02]: too many onerous rates and regulations on
the people who are going to be building
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry and its infancy,
I think, is a general guideline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not the greatest idea in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a question, I am curious what the
review process is going to be over time
[SPEAKER_02]: because the industry will be evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there going to be a review process,
say, to review the regulations and then
[SPEAKER_02]: make changes accordingly, change of
course?
[SPEAKER_16]: I would tell you that the ULCC tries to
regularly look at its rules on a regular
[SPEAKER_16]: basis.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have hearings.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have all kinds of things related to
changing alcohol rules to meet the market.
[SPEAKER_16]: We had to deal with issues related to
growlers.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had to deal with all those kinds of
issues.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were market innovators that were
pushing the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you have a staff and a group of
commissioners who are committed to
[SPEAKER_16]: constantly re-looking at those things.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not just something we put on the
shelf and then keep going.
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe the creativity of both the
edibles as products and the graphics used
[SPEAKER_23]: to advertise them should not be limited by
if it appeals to children.
[SPEAKER_23]: If you as a consumer purchase an edible
product, you need to be responsible for
[SPEAKER_23]: keeping it out of the hands of the
children, just like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand the importance of not
overtaxing based on what's going on in
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my question is, why is it just the
grower?
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like a burden.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what I would tell you is that's what
Oregonians voted on.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what the proponents of the
measure put forward.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we didn't have anything to do with
that at ULCC.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure why they did it that way.
[SPEAKER_16]: They've never provided a great explanation
for me from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that that's our best answer.
[SPEAKER_20]: My work in marketing and advertising on
the Washington side, and I know one
[SPEAKER_20]: question we've come up with quite a bit,
is basically advertising kind of over the
[SPEAKER_20]: border.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess I would kind of encourage and
kind of ask you all if the ULCC plans to
[SPEAKER_20]: really communicate with the LCB in
Washington about how those laws will
[SPEAKER_20]: interact, as far as basically business on
the border advertising back and forth.
[SPEAKER_16]: So just so you understand, the call
memorandum specifically tells us not to be
[SPEAKER_16]: involved in interstate commerce between
the two states.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you are probably not going to see this
commission trying to engage in
[SPEAKER_16]: conversations with Washington about how
that advertising works.
[SPEAKER_28]: The first thing is about size grows,
limitations, residency restrictions.
[SPEAKER_28]: I think all of us are just looking for a
way to protect Oregon from Walmart and
[SPEAKER_28]: Kmart and everything else, and give the
opportunities to the small business.
[SPEAKER_28]: So I appreciate that you guys are taking
that issue seriously.
[SPEAKER_28]: The last thing then is, with regards to
the testing, would that fall under cost of
[SPEAKER_28]: goods sold, and would that be a tax
deductible item?
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be, as you guys are all aware,
there's really specific federal tax rules
[SPEAKER_16]: related to this.
[SPEAKER_16]: There were some deduction things that we
had to deal with that the ULCC is looking
[SPEAKER_16]: at working with Department of Revenue on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree that you shouldn't be heavy
handed in terms of see to sale tracking,
[SPEAKER_06]: but clearly because of the call memo,
and you don't want a product diverted into
[SPEAKER_06]: a black market, and you want to be able to
track it for taxation, clearly you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: have strong, robust see to sale tracking
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would offer a cautionary tale
relative to Washington that really
[SPEAKER_06]: approaches from a technology perspective
and not a policy perspective, so that when
[SPEAKER_06]: you adopt see to sale software regulations
or specifications for a database that
[SPEAKER_06]: allows free, open access to other software
competitors, because that's really going
[SPEAKER_06]: to create what Marvin referred to as the
Silicon Valley of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Oregon has a unique opportunity to
really create a connoisseur culture for
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana and add to the technology
perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: But my question is mostly about growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Later on, when we get moving into this,
how are we going to do breeding and seed
[SPEAKER_07]: sales, even within the state?
[SPEAKER_07]: And before that, how are growers going to
obtain the seeds?
[SPEAKER_16]: So the ULCC is asking the same question as
part of the three plus hour policy
[SPEAKER_16]: discussion we had this morning.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have asked the legislature to clarify
that, because it's not clear from a policy
[SPEAKER_16]: position even what the ULCC should do
related to that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we going to assume immaculate
conception?
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is what a lot of other states
have done.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have asked the legislature to
clarify that from a policy perspective,
[SPEAKER_16]: because we don't want to send our staff
out there into this unknown.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we think it's fair to everybody to at
least clarify what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, my name is Kelly, and I'm a co-owner
of a lab.
[SPEAKER_27]: It also worked to help running a
dispensary since 2010.
[SPEAKER_27]: I just come to give input from a lot of
people I've been talking to.
[SPEAKER_27]: And the organ residency thing seems to be
a big thing that's important to people
[SPEAKER_27]: here.
[SPEAKER_27]: Also with the medibles and concerning
children, a lot of us feel like there's
[SPEAKER_27]: already something in place for that
concern, which is criminal consequences.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know a lot of people in this
industry have kind of taken offense that
[SPEAKER_27]: we get the rap that we are not responsible
adults around children.
[SPEAKER_27]: Also when it comes to lab testing,
I just ask that hopefully you get as much
[SPEAKER_27]: input from as many labs as you can,
instead of just one or two.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then with that, when implementing the
rules, just keep in mind just as much
[SPEAKER_27]: input from the public concerns as there is
from the industry, since we have the most
[SPEAKER_27]: experience of knowing what's efficient and
how this can work best.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of issues relating to banking
are in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in Washington, the horror stories
are just crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: With what people have to go through just
to be able to put their money that they
[SPEAKER_05]: made off this industry in the bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is predominant.
[SPEAKER_16]: The banking issue is predominantly a
federal issue.
[SPEAKER_16]: We just had the Oregon Treasury,
as well as Department of Revenue,
[SPEAKER_16]: as well as M Bank, which is a bank that is
accepting, which is accepting depositors.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are in discussions.
[SPEAKER_16]: M Bank has had some limited discussion
with us related to what they're going to
[SPEAKER_16]: require of their customers.
[SPEAKER_16]: We certainly realize it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have the capacity at the OLCC to
once a month that brings trucks roll up to
[SPEAKER_16]: the front door with cash to pay your
taxes.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have the same concern at OLCC as
well.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are trying to work on that,
but that is predominantly a federal issue
[SPEAKER_16]: that we can't control.
[SPEAKER_33]: First of all, I just want to speak out in
support of the canopy limits, because I
[SPEAKER_33]: believe that one of the main key purposes
of this law is to bring marijuana
[SPEAKER_33]: production into it.
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a tightly well-regulated system.
[SPEAKER_33]: And I believe a key component of that is
co-opting the people that are currently
[SPEAKER_33]: growing on the black market and so forth.
[SPEAKER_33]: And I can tell you that if it's not
designed in such a way to co-opt as many
[SPEAKER_33]: of those as possible, they're going to
just keep on growing, because they've been
[SPEAKER_33]: doing this for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_33]: So if it's not designed for that purpose,
it's going to cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_33]: And having smaller limits will allow the
little guy to have a chance to be able to
[SPEAKER_33]: take part in this industry in an economic
way.
[SPEAKER_33]: And I would say that in Washington,
they had 21,000 square foot limits.
[SPEAKER_33]: They had three tiers.
[SPEAKER_33]: I can tell you that 21,000 square feet of
wheat, 1,000 to 2,000 pounds of wheat,
[SPEAKER_33]: is a lot of wheat.
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's going to be a good size for every
1,000 or 2,000 square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a lot of wheat.
[SPEAKER_33]: The second point is, I am a Clark County
resident.
[SPEAKER_33]: And I know that this is a main issue,
so I don't want to really push anybody's
[SPEAKER_33]: buttons on this.
[SPEAKER_33]: But as a Clark County resident,
I am a member of this metro area.
[SPEAKER_33]: And Clark County residents, we pay over
$150 million a year in income tax revenue
[SPEAKER_33]: to the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_33]: And we're the eighth largest county in
Oregon state as far as tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_33]: And I would just really like to have an
opportunity to take part in the economic
[SPEAKER_33]: life of this community.
[SPEAKER_33]: So I know there isn't any actual residency
requirements in the bill, and that will be
[SPEAKER_33]: up to you guys to decide that.
[SPEAKER_33]: But I would hope that- Actually,
it's up to the legislature to decide.
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, I would just hope that whatever is
decided, that taking into consideration
[SPEAKER_33]: the economic participation of adjacent
counties, I would hope that you would keep
[SPEAKER_33]: that under consideration.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the concerns I have, just to kind
of touch on the point that the gentleman
[SPEAKER_10]: just made, was if we're creating a seed to
sale system, isn't that kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: contradictory to not allowing canopy
limits?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if a seed to sale and you're
trying to track it to make sure you keep
[SPEAKER_10]: it off the black market, but then you give
farmers the ability to grow an abundant
[SPEAKER_10]: amount of product, that supply and demand,
it doesn't work properly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's inevitable that some of us
going to get to the black market the
[SPEAKER_10]: second concern I have is co-mingling
medical marijuana dispensaries with
[SPEAKER_10]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_10]: In my mind, I track this pretty closely.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been part of the industry for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in my mind, the medical marijuana
dispensary side was able to be established
[SPEAKER_10]: before the law was even voted on for
recreational use.
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyone that wants to come into the
business going through the due process of
[SPEAKER_10]: trying to do it with the legal parameters
that were given, we're not given an
[SPEAKER_10]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, if you do co-mingle those
two, there's no real reason for you to
[SPEAKER_10]: have any licensing application for the
recreational side, especially in the city
[SPEAKER_10]: of Portland.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's that many retailers already out
there on the medical dispensary side,
[SPEAKER_10]: and it doesn't give the recreational side
the ability to tap into that market,
[SPEAKER_32]: what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_32]: What are we here for?
[SPEAKER_32]: If someone buys, let's just say a brownie
or even flour or whatever they buy,
[SPEAKER_32]: are they going to be able to look up where
it came from, who grew it, if it's organic
[SPEAKER_32]: or any of that kind of stuff?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be tracked all the way
through the system.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know that we're going to make that
available exactly to the person.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're more into tracking the product,
not necessarily the product back.
[SPEAKER_32]: And will there be a tax write-off for
people who get outside software to help
[SPEAKER_32]: pay for the stuff?
[SPEAKER_16]: As we read the bill, or as we read the law
currently, there will be, those will be
[SPEAKER_16]: cost of goods sold.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's been a lot of questions
sometimes related to licensing.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no limit on licenses in the state
of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_16]: The OCC would have to choose to do that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't do that under alcohol regulation.
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't, we aren't down that path yet,
but you certainly have heard not to have
[SPEAKER_16]: any restrictions on licenses everywhere.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've gone pretty much for the most part.
[SPEAKER_21]: What are the limits on THC per serving and
per package?
[SPEAKER_21]: And what's the maximum?
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't set those limits and those are
going to be things that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_16]: having a conversation with Oregon about as
we go through the rules process.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause I know in Washington, I saw about a
hundred milligrams per package and I know
[SPEAKER_21]: there's users that use more than that in a
day.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just know that'd be expensive.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're certainly looking at, we're
certainly looking at setting a serving
[SPEAKER_16]: size standard, which is how we believe
we're going to have to inform the public
[SPEAKER_16]: about it.
[SPEAKER_16]: What that size is and how much that is,
we're going to have to be able to put out
[SPEAKER_16]: there.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're not sure what that is.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to say keeping the existing
medical dispensaries and recreational
[SPEAKER_13]: dispensaries distinctly separate gives the
recreational dispensaries a more even,
[SPEAKER_13]: okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the limits on the personal grows
doesn't allow for enough of the next
[SPEAKER_13]: generation to keep a perpetual grow going.
[SPEAKER_13]: And four plants isn't going to last
anybody a year.
[SPEAKER_26]: My questions first was on a public level
of public transparency.
[SPEAKER_26]: Will you make the public engagement
statistics?
[SPEAKER_26]: Will all this information that you've been
collecting, will you make that information
[SPEAKER_26]: public?
[SPEAKER_26]: So we know that actually what the people
have spoken is actually reflected upon
[SPEAKER_26]: your actions.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're summarizing what's,
what's been done.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're trying to make that available.
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the secondary question,
you mentioned the 40 some items that you'd
[SPEAKER_26]: sent off the legislature for
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_26]: I was wondering if that was sent out to be
made publicly via your email list or
[SPEAKER_26]: system.
[SPEAKER_16]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're, we haven't adopted it yet.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to probably adopted the
commission.
[SPEAKER_16]: Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.
[SPEAKER_26]: After adoption, it would go out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: After adoption, it's going to be,
it's a public document as it is,
[SPEAKER_16]: but yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: Tomorrow it'll be available.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_26]: The basically that my only statements are
one, just a request to treat alcohol,
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, to treat the cannabis similar to
alcohol and tobacco and specifically for
[SPEAKER_26]: alcohol and wine, specifically alcohol a
hundred plus times.
[SPEAKER_26]: The most recent study more harmful than
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_26]: Cannabis medical or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_26]: And my request is just strongly to reduce
whatever camping and trees is involved in
[SPEAKER_26]: this sort of have as much fairness and
parody and whatever you're treating,
[SPEAKER_26]: whatever, especially on recreation market.
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the last is tourism to make it
available for tourism.
[SPEAKER_26]: And then fencing with the fencing,
it costs 40 grand a fence, an acre of 50
[SPEAKER_26]: or more, eight to 10 feet high with cycle
and fencing, which takes about 18 seconds
[SPEAKER_26]: to break through that same 40 grand would
create a security system with lasers and
[SPEAKER_26]: lights and forget the whole nine yards,
auto tracking, auto alarms, much cheaper
[SPEAKER_26]: and much more effective for an electronic
system than a hardware.
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to highly recommend that we do ban
edibles that are appealing to kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several products that can be used
that aren't attractive to kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to see the edibles like
the candy and the suckers and the gummy
[SPEAKER_00]: bears and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
