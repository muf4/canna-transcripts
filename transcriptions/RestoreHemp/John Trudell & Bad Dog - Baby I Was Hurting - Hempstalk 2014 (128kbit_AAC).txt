[SPEAKER_01]: from a dreamer's dream I lied to myself
for canyons of gold For there were no
[SPEAKER_01]: canyons, there was no hope Out of control,
all spaces praying to God Against those
[SPEAKER_01]: who see you changing disguise First I
tried fighting, then I was crying When
[SPEAKER_01]: finally I saw you were one Then I was
hurting,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I was hurting Always, always,
always wanting you
[SPEAKER_01]: During first impressions, our days were
good Close as we got, then you slipped
[SPEAKER_01]: away Melting my eyes, I saw you pain I
vainly traded myself for illusion Bane
[SPEAKER_01]: lies, desperately pretending I tried
talking to someones I couldn't see But
[SPEAKER_01]: they wouldn't show At least not to me When
I tried tearing down those rotating walls
[SPEAKER_01]: Turning into a continuing storm Worn away
by what I couldn't tear down Passion on
[SPEAKER_01]: fire turned to rain, then into ice Then I
was hurting, then I was hurting Baby,
[SPEAKER_01]: baby, baby, I was hurting
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I was after what I didn't deserve
Maybe what I got was what I did Anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a story I lived We are what we
learn, even as we deny Today could be our
[SPEAKER_01]: day paid for the luxury or the torment of
self-denial Anyway, I'm feeling like
[SPEAKER_01]: someone you used After someone else you
used Like if sometimes someone else must
[SPEAKER_01]: have used you Savage fire wasn't enough to
love Heart keeps questioning my mind in
[SPEAKER_01]: heated debate Can't help being angry Can't
help being just as sad But I see you're
[SPEAKER_01]: only another victim And I'm only another
victim too Baby, I was hurting Baby,
[SPEAKER_01]: baby, baby, I keep hurting Baby,
baby, I keep hurting from always wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: you And baby, baby, I keep hurting from
not getting you And baby, I keep hurting
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby, I was hurting Baby, baby,
I keep hurting from always wanting you
[SPEAKER_00]: And baby, baby, I keep hurting Baby,
baby, I keep hurting Baby, baby,
I keep hurting
