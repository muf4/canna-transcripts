[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing radio?
[SPEAKER_00]: Radio station, RadioFreeAmsterdam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do now, that's my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time do you spend over there in
the Netherlands?
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as I can get away with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any work there, so I have to
go other places to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I go back there to spend the
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Michigan, what's the scene like
there now these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispensary is opening up?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they shut down the attorney general of
the state of Michigan, William Shewitt.
[SPEAKER_00]: General Shewitt was also the guy who
before he was elected attorney general as
[SPEAKER_00]: a Republican.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pretty much imagine what a state
governed by a tough nerd is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be nothing nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been taking over the local city
governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's part of their plan,
especially those operated by Negroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the white people know how to do
this better because they did so well with
[SPEAKER_00]: our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they like to go in and take over the
city under this thing called Emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: Manager System.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows them to void all of their
union contracts, declare bankruptcy,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of the pensions so people wouldn't
spend all their lives working for these
[SPEAKER_00]: cities, and tell them what to do for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just averted this in Detroit,
but they have an emergency financial board
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to run the city, which the
city had to agree to accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only alternative was to accept an
emergency manager system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very gruesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cities like Detroit and Flint,
my hometown, are ruined beyond repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Economically, they've been disinvesting in
them for about 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've finally reached the fairly
well-off suburban ring of white people
[SPEAKER_00]: that surrounds Detroit a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start hearing about
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the city of Detroit, the real city
of Detroit, they did away with the jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: about 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got at least two generations,
maybe, three generations of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: never had a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't own a job yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know anyone who's had a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one in their family has had a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're desperate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst possible sort of situation,
as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sick part of it is this is the
vanguard of what they're holding up as the
[SPEAKER_00]: model for the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Shewitt's supposed to be the
Republican guru, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I started out to say that Shewitt
led the opposition to the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana initiative in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he lost on about a 2 to 1 basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he was elected in 2010 as part of
the Republican backlash to the
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now he uses the attorney general's
office as his focal point for trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: oppose the medical marijuana initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does things like hold seminars for
local law enforcement and prosecutors'
[SPEAKER_00]: offices around the state of Michigan,
which then is followed by busts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like in Traverse City.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tries to explain to local and regional
law enforcement people how they can
[SPEAKER_00]: circumvent the medical marijuana act and
still bust people and prevent them from
[SPEAKER_00]: having places where people can get their
medicine and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, Michigan, the medical marijuana law
recognizes only one sort of relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is between a registered patient
and a registered caregiver who can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: for by patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no provision in the initiative law
that was passed for dispensaries or any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of transfer outside of this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that's not caretaker to patient
relation as regarded is not acceptable by
[SPEAKER_00]: the state authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of gruesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were building a great industry
throughout the state with dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as you know, they just started
derating them and shutting them down and
[SPEAKER_00]: persecuting people, like my friend Adam
Brook, who organized the hash bash for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They raided him for marijuana,
and then he had some illegal guns in his
[SPEAKER_00]: house, and now he's in prison for two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Michigan State Prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Michigan, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the side effects of this
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either they shut him down, or he was a
patient, and he was registered,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all his marijuana issues were in
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, he was a gun nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel terrible for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, I have no guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have my guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's doing a good job, but yeah,
it's just him and the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had a group that's met every
Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met over at their office once about,
I don't know, four months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've been doing that every week
for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the initiative came out of that,
but they don't have the support of the
[SPEAKER_00]: money people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with the big money who help support
the medical marijuana initiative,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some sort of,
I don't know, the dispensary people have
[SPEAKER_00]: their own organization, and they're kind
of trying to make a deal with the state
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the side, and they aren't
really supporting the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, I pray for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been waiting for this for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started my crusade, as I might say,
against the marijuana laws in January of
[SPEAKER_00]: 1965.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you start it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out a flyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in Michigan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received in the mail from New York City
a flyer that said, New York, Lemar,
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Allen Ginsberg's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allen Ginsberg and Ed Sanders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this in the mail one day,
and I said, well, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have one that was in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to our meeting and grabbed a
machine, and took up a stencil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ran off a thing, and sent it out,
and said the first meeting is such and
[SPEAKER_00]: such, and we're going to legalize
marijuana in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're trying to legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought everything would be done by
1977.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my initial outlook.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I thought, too, back in the
late 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ, what's wrong with these
people?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about money, power, and economic
and political control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, they got this police state they
built up on our backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This vast, huge, almost indescribably
large police state apparatus.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you count, well, what's the federal
government spending a year now,
[SPEAKER_00]: $18 billion on the war on drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't count the states,
you see, which finance their stormtrooper
[SPEAKER_00]: activities by seizing the assets and the
products of the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they buy a battering ram,
electronic battering rams and tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then you go beyond the police,
and there's the courts, and the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: courts, and the extra prosecutors,
all the extra coppers, and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics bureaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got the probation officers,
the prison industry, the parole industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my favorite, the drug treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug treatment industry, which is the
most asinine and vicious of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter had this pill over by the side
of the road and had a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had to go to rehabilitation for
being a marijuana smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could you possibly do to combat,
you know, what's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole thing is it's all based on
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all like Jake Harris said,
they don't have no clothes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's nothing wrong with,
why am I talking to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the whole thing is just a
ridiculous misstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started in Michigan, it was a
narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got that law overturned though,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your case ended up in having that declared
unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to spend three years in prison to do
that without an amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without an appeal bond.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For only two joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened after they declared the
Michigan medical, I mean the Michigan
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana law unconstitutional?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the legislature go right into session
to recreate the laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature had already dealt with
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they passed a new law reclassifying
marijuana as a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I said it was more like a spitball.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they redefined it and the important
part was they changed the entire system of
[SPEAKER_00]: penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of 20 to life, they're giving
away or selling marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the legislature passed this law on
December 9th of 1971.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the stipulation was that it was going
to affect on April 1st, 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my case was decided by the Michigan
Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_00]: My case and I was linked to another case
of a guy who was convicted of sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was only convicted of possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our attorneys linked these two cases
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both won.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they threw out the whole marijuana
penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we released and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on an initiative here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was on like March 9th or March 12th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new law was going into effect on
April 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so for three weeks we had a
situation in Michigan where there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a little taste of freedom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was right when you got out too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would have events where you smoked
joints on stage and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took full advantage of this small
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one now, April 1st came on April
Fool's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we had the first hash bash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the first hash bash started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our noses had these people in so
you might put this law into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we aren't going to pay any more
attention to this one than we did to the
[SPEAKER_00]: much more severe one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'll pardon the expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I like about the hash bash
because they have it every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just send it forty seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That started right around your case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're working on an initiative
here in Oregon to completely legalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much like Matt Abel's initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're at about, we only need 87,000
signatures to qualify.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just tossed 70,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got 70,000 we have to lie sixth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is a excerpt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well you've got ten million people
where Oregon only has three million.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is text from our initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Where is the people find that
despite misinformation and cocked to
[SPEAKER_01]: justify campus provision, the courts of
Alaska, Hawaii, and guess who?
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan have noted presidential
commission findings that characterize
[SPEAKER_01]: campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I call a comparatively
harmless euphoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beneficial thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the medical part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the fiber part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I happen to agree with Dennis
Perrone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're up against a very sickening
social system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know if I couldn't get high every
day, I would just dash my head against the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find a way to elevate above it
to figure out the way to get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you play music.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an MC5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you just play a gig?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some music here tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just sat in with my friend,
Reggie Houston, and a great pianist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Janice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Janice Scroggins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last night, Reggie played with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We played with the Star Theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known Reggie when we both lived in
New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As he says, decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally had a chance to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a poet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set my poems to music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seek high level musicians like Lonnie D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wages, who backed me up two nights before
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't afford to carry my musicians
around with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives me the opportunity to
collaborate with lots of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to play some gigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going out to Astoria, and then up
to Seattle?
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're playing something in Astoria Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're playing two gigs Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long I'm going to be
playing with them, but I'm sure we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you're done here next week,
are you going back to Michigan or back to
Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be in Detroit just for a week for my
daughters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be in Detroit on Monday and Tuesday,
the 30th and 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there seeing patients at our THCF
medical clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right over at Southfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we opened in Michigan on the day
the law went into effect, December 8th.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a head start on all the other
clinics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a big jump start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got some busy clinics set up for
Monday and Tuesday, right off of Northwest
[SPEAKER_01]: Highway and 12 Mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there anything you would want to
tell people today in terms of reforming
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you tell activists today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Matt Abels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The language, the idea of ending marijuana
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what they did was the initiative
was to mandate, if passed, the removal of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana from any of the statutes of the
state of Michigan, where it's proscribing
[SPEAKER_00]: different things it would not be able to
prescribe marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that would open the door for the
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're trying to do here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting it on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon's been in the bingo for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when Alaska was legal in
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then under Ronnie Reagan, they got the
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers put out an initiative to
recriminalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the courts threw it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, under Bill Bennett, the first drug
czar, they pushed that through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think we were supposed to have
czars in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Czars are like autocratic rulers despotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when they collapsed,
America ate the heart of the enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It replaced the American heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have an American heart anymore,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is just the coldest,
ugliest, most non-caring society,
[SPEAKER_00]: way beyond any of my wildest imaginings I
could be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all my life I've never really been
able to subscribe to the social system
[SPEAKER_00]: that dominates you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the CIA, there's a big military
coup in this country back on November
[SPEAKER_01]: 22nd, 1963.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't realize it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was hardened when the CIA
director took over the government
[SPEAKER_00]: personally in January of 1981 as the vice
president of Ronald Reagan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw too much air between Bill
Clinton and the CIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed to be pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: My president now seems to be very close
with the CIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CIA were the people that didn't happen
to see the collapse of the Soviet Union
[SPEAKER_00]: coming, although they'd been watching it
through a microscope for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much intelligence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that had the weapons of mass
destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should go to Iraq for 10 years,
try to bomb them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sure that they had a weapon of
mass destruction because they sold it to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't believe that they had
dismantled them when they were supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidently, they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, they would have bombed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate you coming in and
talking to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm glad I had a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to do this for a year,
I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first invited me, the idea of
flying from Detroit to Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon to do a TV show, I don't even watch
TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had no attraction for me
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I ended up coming out here
to do some gigs, I thought, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I need to do Paul's show now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real pleasure, Travis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we're just... I feel assured
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
