[SPEAKER_00]: I started working with the Grateful Dead
in 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running the rock medicine team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was buck stopper for the down 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Jerry died in 1995, that same
month we were having a hip rally up here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I retired from running the rock
medicine team and decided that I needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the hip rally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing hip rally since 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came up here, I played on main
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was done with that,
I helped just do rock medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of the crowd issues and things
that come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we discovered was in a hip rally,
there are not too many things that come up
[SPEAKER_00]: in a crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot less than they did at the dead
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a long journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it is 2015 and I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I represent Seattle Hip Fest as the grand
prize committee now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been opening act for 19 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have a whole bunch of things
that we do to try to raise money for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cause now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of turned from a gut
wrenching, everybody's going to jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: to now a celebration and everybody's here
and they're all making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a different world now than when
we started, as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just glad to be a part of it still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you bring up a really good common
point when people say, well, why do you
[SPEAKER_00]: still need to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't you win?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we won here in Washington,
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won a little bit in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won a little bit in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've won a little bit in some states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quite frankly, there's still people
getting cops pulling them over every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still people who are getting
arrested every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still people getting put in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still people being fined,
going to prison, losing their kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting their dog shot in their front
yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still people, as long as that is
going on, will be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to make sure your voice is
being heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you really believe in what you're
doing, you've got to stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to speak the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I've really ever tried to do
is stand up and speak the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: either in my written word, in my vocal
word, in my singing word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just stand up and speak the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speak the truth to power, you'll never
lose out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak the truth to power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we've tried to do here as a
conscious effort throughout all the years
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've been here at the HMFest.
