[SPEAKER_00]: Our next speaker, Donnie Wirtschafter,
is just one of the pioneers of industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an attorney, he's a businessman,
a philanthropist, and he's a long-standing
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle HempFest core member.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up to my brother Donnie
Wirtschafter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, welcome to the house of Jack Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not be here, HempFest would not
be here, would not for Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We owe it to Jack to do something about
this prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to tell you a story about a case
that's going on here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: People haven't read about this in your
newspapers yet, but listen to how
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous the drug war gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you sit here comfortable in Seattle,
knowing that our energy passed,
[SPEAKER_01]: an initiative that keeps the cops off our
backs and out of our pockets, the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, the rest of America suffers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't just winning an initiative in
Seattle that's going to get this gorilla
[SPEAKER_01]: off our backs, it's stopping this whole
damn drug war, freeing our friends in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail, and starting over again with tax and
regulator, whatever you want to come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with, just let it stop this present chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so listen to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how bad the DEA gets in this crazy
state of ours in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you work for the DEA and you're
sitting here in your tight eyes today,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to listen up extra hard,
because this is about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a normal couple in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: The woman is really sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had polio as a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has, you know, blown up from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw 400 pounds, gets surgery,
surgery goes bad, and she spends a month
[SPEAKER_01]: on the operating table just to save her
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had her in a coma for a month just to
save her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has no stomach anymore from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's had a crazy diet where she has to
eat papaya all day long to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're up there by the Canadian border in
the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get papaya?
[SPEAKER_01]: They build a greenhouse and filled the
greenhouse with papaya plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two years later, they got their
sustenance and papayas coming out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the DEA gets wind of them,
of their son growing pot and on their
[SPEAKER_01]: joining place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the DEA comes up in the middle of the
night with boats up the river,
[SPEAKER_01]: sneaks on their farm with ninjas,
guys in black, black hoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is how people get killed
around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sneak on the farm trying to find
the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't find it, but, oh, there's a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come back the next day and they
do, that was, they call it sneak and peek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their technique was to do a knock
and talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where they come up and knock on
the front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hi, we're just looking for somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they look around and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do the knock and talk and they
say, we can smell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these are licensed Washington
patients, and that's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy to be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are licensed Washington patients,
but this is our federal government at
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go to the judge and they don't say
anything to the judge about, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: we smelled marijuana at a licensed
Washington patients house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, we smelled marijuana and that
was their probable cause to come in with
[SPEAKER_01]: the helicopters and 14 agencies,
a hundred and some officers to arrest this
[SPEAKER_01]: couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are 31 plants that they were
legally growing under Washington law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not the tragic part.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DA comes in the greenhouse,
all expecting to see a room full of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and find a room full of papayas.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the DEA do with that room full
of papayas?
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're taught to do, machete them
down and carry them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all this work to keep this woman alive
is wasted by these guys tearing down these
[SPEAKER_01]: papayas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take two years to produce,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so this has gotten really crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This case, the husband went to court,
federal court, had a jury trial where this
[SPEAKER_01]: is all going on, but because of the way
the federal government is schizophrenic
[SPEAKER_01]: about medical marijuana, the judge orders
that he can't say anything about medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in the trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, but wait a minute,
it wasn't mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my wife's and she's not being
charged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's so sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't charge her.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they, if the jury saw how sick she was,
they would let her go.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got ordered to come to court without
her wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wasn't allowed to look sick in front
of the jury.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't mention medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't mention the fact that on the
wall of the grow is all her medical
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork and her saying, this is mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The husband being charged with this crime
couldn't even say is my wife's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how crazy this trial is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now their farm is up for forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to go through all
these steps of appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lost his job on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just been a, you know, from a family
that was surviving, they're going to kill
[SPEAKER_01]: these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, this is our government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I want you to all think
about the hemp and what it can do for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want you to think about all these
people that we need to go to the aid and
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people out there just
cause we're comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after years of work, we can be
comfortable token on this grass without
[SPEAKER_01]: having the cops come in and grab us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everybody for being so kind that
we won this victory here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to spread this victory across the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So help all these groups to see at these
booths, go buy your hemp clothes,
[SPEAKER_01]: join something, do something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we are in a heap of trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are not letting go very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Okay.
