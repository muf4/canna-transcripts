[SPEAKER_01]: What we've got here, the first thing I
should show you is this shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is made of hemp with a blend with
cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 55% hemp, 45% cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's made of hemp, 55% hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lasts longer, it's 26% more water
absorbent, it's more insulative,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's much stronger than regular cotton
would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the foreground here, I've got three
pieces of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, this is like a
parchment-style paper here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what your Declaration of
Independence and Constitution were
[SPEAKER_01]: originally written on, a paper similar to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a filtration paper here,
tea bags, things that you need to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay strong when it's wet, because hemp
fiber is strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't lose that when it's in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This in the middle looks like a newsprint
type of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pulp paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made of hemp, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they use this back in the early days,
you know, like around Constitution time or
[SPEAKER_01]: something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, they didn't use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pulp paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used more like this, the fiber paper
that's... And they wrote on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manuscript paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, over here we have some seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is used as bird seed right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the birds high, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's called happy bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, birds sing better because when
they use it, we don't know if it's...
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very little THC in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be because it moistens their
throat, because it has a lot of oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's 30% oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right next to it here, we have some
hair gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is made from hemp oil, and it's also
got some herbs in it, some of the herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, moving forward a little further,
we see some other products that are made
[SPEAKER_01]: from the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the seed is crushed, it produces
oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a high-protein powder here,
which is called seed cake, this is more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional than any other thing that we
know of, excepting for soya.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of digestibility,
it's more digestible than soya.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually... When you look at parts
of the world like Northern Africa and
[SPEAKER_01]: Bangladesh and these areas where there's a
lot of mass starvation, a lot of that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: result of international laws that are
preventing them from growing hemp for use
[SPEAKER_01]: as a food supply, which it has been for
thousands of years for these countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law is...
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Convention Treaty of 1961 by the
United Nations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you notice that the big periods of
starvation began in the mid-60s,
[SPEAKER_01]: late-60s, and continue on to today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within 10 years of banning hemp,
starvation became part of the norm for
[SPEAKER_01]: these parts of the world.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, these two pieces of oil and samples
of oil, this is a raw oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it's got a little brownish color,
similar to the seed itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, on the other hand, has been
distilled, and so it's cleaner-looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make anything from machine oil to
cooking oil out of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all fibers from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a rather raw fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called a tow line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these are from Russian hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russian hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this string here and this rope,
they're both from Hungarian hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been weighed into a bag here
through a macrame process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've wrapped it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a potholder made out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your balls have twined.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tea bag back in here, and it swings
this right back down to the plant from
[SPEAKER_01]: which all these products can be made.
Wow.
