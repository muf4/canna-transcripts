[SPEAKER_01]: Joining us on the program is Debbie
Goldsberry, who's the co-founder of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Action Network, acronym CAN.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is CAN all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Cannabis Action Network is what's
called an unincorporated association.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a charity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a group of people who have got
together for a common cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cause or our goal is to legalize
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've noticed from being involved with
the hemp movement that it's not always
[SPEAKER_01]: that the ladies seem to want to speak up
or they're not after a woman, the front
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a good example of someone who's
not intimidated by being out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're afraid for their children.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're afraid of the
repercussions that can happen in their
[SPEAKER_01]: professional lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't have children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professional life, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a professional activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what do you tell these people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, I think what it is is
it's a difference between the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: male and female are socialized in our
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females are literally socialized to be
more in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find in the marijuana movement and
what's going on that when females do join
[SPEAKER_00]: the movement, they're working behind a
table or they're in some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, they choose that position because
that's where we would feel more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a woman actually does step forward,
there is a lot of discrimination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not discrimination solely within the
marijuana movement, the whole entire
[SPEAKER_00]: country, if not the whole entire world,
however that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a lot within the marijuana
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like everyone says,
there's a lot of middle-aged men involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is the Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: political scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been like this here for hundreds of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as getting more people involved,
I think it's important for women who are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved to stand up and to take a forward
role in the movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, occasionally, I've heard the girls
that can, the ladies that can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're a co-founder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else put this together with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Cannabis Action Network wasn't
actually founded by all women.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was founded by a group of women or
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it started out with was a group of
college students around the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois, along with National Normal and
Wisconsin Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the long run, when it came down to it,
after we'd gone through a couple years,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't actually start Cannes
right away, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started the hemp tour project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Action Network came after about a
year of hemp tours, after we decided that
[SPEAKER_00]: we did need to start some sort of a
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, a group of us, I guess you
could say friends, got together,
[SPEAKER_00]: a girl who were friends, and we started a
national organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you tour, I know, from reading in
High Times Magazine, and I've been in
[SPEAKER_01]: association, of course, with the hemp
organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do go coast to coast, and you've had
the opportunity to see firsthand the
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiasm or lack of enthusiasm towards
the hemp movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: How strong of a body do you think we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a very strong body of
enthusiastic supporters out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've found when we go across the
country, it pretty much goes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a place like New York City or a state
where there's a decriminalization law,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't get as much support.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a place where there's a lot of harsh
laws, a lot of police intimidation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what's happened is that the
more the government fights against us,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more that we, the users, the cannabis
supporters, realize that we have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: together and work to legalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now, when you raise your voice in
society, you raise it with strength and
[SPEAKER_01]: pride, but a lot of people still aren't
being able to have the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you plan to continue with hemp
tours, and so how do you plan to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to promote them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the way the hemp tour works is it
has a couple different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off with the beginning level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beginning level is to get our
activists to find the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in legalizing the activist
supporters who can carry on bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: better projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually takes a couple years in any
given area to get a good, solid core of
[SPEAKER_00]: activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we change the platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of finding our activists,
what we do is we want to educate the
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would call that an A tour, a main focus
tour, and we bring along a national
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker, like Jack Harare, LV Music,
a medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point that we're at right now,
doing our A tours, educational forums,
[SPEAKER_00]: to reach out to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That involves things like debates and
lectures, public forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, and that's the point that
we're at right now, after this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we plan on developing a new strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get bigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal right now is to have statewide
conferences in every state, get the
[SPEAKER_00]: organizers together to meet at roundtable
discussions, and to form a more direct
[SPEAKER_00]: political agenda, lobbying, direct
demonstration type of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you stem at Elixic in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there chapters or other CAN
organizations across America that people
[SPEAKER_01]: can contact, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are CAN organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabis Action Network is not a
membership organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a network of organizations across the
country and activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Involved in the network, we have about 200
organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has grown exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago, we only had five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of actually encouraging people to
become CAN organizations, we encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: people to develop their own organization,
study local drug policy, come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that will be effective right in
their hometown.
[SPEAKER_01]: From touring coast to coast, and I know
you've had a chance to meet a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people, what have you seen firsthand?
[SPEAKER_01]: What injustice have you seen firsthand?
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you seen firsthand that are
stemming from the prohibition laws that
[SPEAKER_01]: you really think need to be immediately
changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh boy, I've seen a lot of injustices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing that I think is that we
need to educate our enforcement police
[SPEAKER_00]: departments, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell you a story about Oakland,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were out in Oakland at a Grateful Dead
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we set up hemp information
tables, display books, t-shirts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a permit to set up the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the Grateful Dead lot,
like I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, where's your permit?
[SPEAKER_00]: We show them the permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, marijuana table, permit,
this can't be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, we have to call the sergeant to
hold onto the permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So police officer has a permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're motorcycle cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy gets on his motorcycle with the
permit, and he leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other cops say, well, it doesn't
matter anyway, because even if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your permit, we're going to park our
motorcycles right in front of your table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to come up to your table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sergeant comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, where's your permit?
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cop just drove away with our permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you don't have a permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll arrest you if you don't leave right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right there, we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the discrimination against the
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's discrimination against the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just blatant violations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really understand the
Constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you say you set up booths at the
Grateful Dead consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of information do you get out of
these booths?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our main focus is what we call our
hemp museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different displays of hemp
products that come from around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you can import hemp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We display the seeds and the seed cake,
the granola bars, the cloth, different
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pass out information, and we sell
products that display our message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we feel if somebody wears a
t-shirt around with the marijuana slogan,
[SPEAKER_00]: tens of thousands of people will see that
message over the course of the next couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you had the opportunity to
encourage somebody to join you,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you encourage them to go on the
road, work in their own local area?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would you go about recruiting that
individual?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would encourage each person to choose
their focus individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide what you're best designed to do
within this movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a million facets that we need to
cover, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you tell ladies when they come up
and say, I want to get involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm afraid if I do, I'll lose my
children?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a tough question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people, first of all, what they
need to do is they need to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to a situation like this,
when you're facing something like losing a
[SPEAKER_00]: child, number one, you're going to be
faced with the authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're faced with the authorities,
basically what we say is it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: on-the-spot type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate yourself so if you're faced with a
problem, you can argue your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why you should have to
worry about your children being taken
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing wrong with supporting the
First Amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you primarily an informational
organization, or can someone call if they
[SPEAKER_01]: need help in a particular area and find
that type of help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, we're a network,
and we can act as a referral to different
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations, whereas we might not have
that many resources or much information at
[SPEAKER_00]: our Kentucky base.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can refer you to all kinds of people
all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can help people take care of
problems, hopefully in their own areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had the opportunity to say one
thing to the people sitting at home
[SPEAKER_01]: listening that might encourage them to get
off their fanny and do something
[SPEAKER_01]: productive, what would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to say that it's working,
and that's what people have to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem that we have right now is that
the situation has reached a critical
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our laws are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laws are so bad that people don't even
realize anymore that there is a problem as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as the Constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize they have the right to
speak up for their rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize there's a right to
protest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize that they can pass out
information about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would tell people is basically
the only way that we're going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: this, the only way that we're going to
change this debate, is to get out there to
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise our First Amendment rights and to
talk to people about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start talking to people,
you become empowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: People understand that it's the truth,
and literally you're thanked a million
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been nice having you on our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's refreshing to hear someone speak as
honestly as you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you all the luck in everything that
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be back on our show again
sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we've learned today, there's a lot
going on in the world that we still need
[SPEAKER_01]: yet to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do it without a group of people
joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need each other to make that
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, take the time, take the courage to
make a difference in your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time, keep strong, keep happy,
keep wise.
Thank you.
