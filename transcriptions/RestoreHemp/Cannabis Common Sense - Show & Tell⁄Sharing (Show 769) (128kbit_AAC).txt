[SPEAKER_00]: This is a circa 1920 bottle from Eli
Lilly, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right next to it we have an 1890
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually still full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is lipoise balsam for coughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cough medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This box is in like five different
languages and it comes with this insert
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in nine more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a very useful medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one from 1910, specific
standard medicines out of Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lloyd brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold many of these medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a partially full bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an unopened box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has the full bottle still inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it, this bottle was dug up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a embossed bottle that says,
as you can see, Dr. D.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: James's Cannabis Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was another medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis with, what else has it got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lecithin and lime and iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a little bit of strychnine in it
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they put that in there,
but it's for nervous prostration,
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous exhaustion, nervous disability,
nervous excitement, hysteria, and all
[SPEAKER_00]: depressed conditions of the nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read that right on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a widely used medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, we're still burning
our hemp flame of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hemp seed oil burning a wick of
hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why marijuana was made
illegal, folks, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about money and power and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They created the whole marijuana myth to
protect the petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_00]: military, industrial, transnational,
crony, corporate, elite, ruling class and
[SPEAKER_00]: their wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those guys too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp flame of freedom continues to
burn brightly here on Cannabis Common Sense.
