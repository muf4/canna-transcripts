[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Willie Nelson and I urge you to
support the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate marijuana and restore industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This initiative will end adult marijuana
prohibition and let our criminal justice
[SPEAKER_00]: officers focus limited resources on real
criminals and not on marijuana users like
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okta will also allow farmers to grow hemp
for fuel, fiber, and food to create jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: and help our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please support Okta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
