[SPEAKER_00]: of the principles of gasification.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lit cigarette and when the air
goes the normal direction, when the air
[SPEAKER_00]: goes this way, all the oxygen is burned up
and makes heat and it roasts the tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: into charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how white that smoke is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're able to pick that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I blow this way, there is oxygen
available right at the flame front.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the smoke is invisible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is tar destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tar production.
[SPEAKER_00]: One third of the weight of the cigarette
gets turned into tars.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I reverse it, so one third equals
300,000 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's one third is 300,000 parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rounding off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I reverse the flow, I take it
down to 1,000 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to express the reduction,
but I'll call that a 300-fold reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: tars and that gives us a gas that's much
more cleanable because those tars will gum
[SPEAKER_00]: up an engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a patent that I was the
inventor of, which takes us down from
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 parts per million down to under 100
parts per million tars, which gives us a
[SPEAKER_00]: very easily cleanable gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you very much.
