[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there, let's review a little history
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that marijuana, camp, cannabis has
been a vital part of our society before
[SPEAKER_00]: the Industrial Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 80% of the world's commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good reason for them to try to
eliminate you as a grower, because that
[SPEAKER_00]: was the material that built homes,
made beautiful clothes for me to wear,
[SPEAKER_00]: fine paper that does hold up much better
than the trees we're killing, and it does
[SPEAKER_00]: not destroy the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it re-oxygenates the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they made a prohibition way back then,
but in the United States it actually began
[SPEAKER_00]: 101 years ago in 1913.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1913 it was totally outlawed in the
state of California, and the Hearst Press
[SPEAKER_00]: was spreading their lies and
misinformation, which is the only basis
[SPEAKER_00]: that was used for this prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time 1937 came around, several
states had joined that prohibition and
[SPEAKER_00]: kept adding to the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1950 we began to realize that what they
had really outlawed was this wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: thing called cannabis, the greatest
medicine known and the oldest medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: known to humanity, which has never killed
anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: People began to use it recreationally and
try to write laws regarding to make
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1960 there was a morphia and then
came normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most exciting thing that's happened is
in the 90s, students for Sensible Drug
[SPEAKER_00]: Coalition are incredibly brilliant young
people who are making a difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: and young people all over this country
have been educated thanks to the
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs and the internet and the
fact that so many wonderful books,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially The Emperor Wears No Clothes,
came back out in 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1988 was an incredible year for marijuana
because also the DEA based on chief
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative law judge had had a chance
to review the medical evidence and said
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was the oldest medicine known to
humanity and for a government to come
[SPEAKER_00]: between a patient's suffering and the
benefits of this substance was so
[SPEAKER_00]: unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That decision came three weeks after I had
been acquitted in the state of Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had been using it to maintain
the site on my left eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: By then we had destroyed my right eye
completely, both through ignorance and
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had thought marijuana was not safe and I
allowed all the cutting in my better eye
[SPEAKER_00]: till I was totally blinded in 1987 and in
1998 I came to court with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The support in Florida was amazing,
amazing, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You covered my trial, you covered all the
things that happened prior to that and you
[SPEAKER_00]: supported me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Norm Kent, who is now the director of
NORMAL, did it pro bono.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then I have discovered the history
of the prohibition and can never stay home
[SPEAKER_00]: because in 1990 I met Juan Jacque here who
wrote The Emperor Wears No Clothes and who
[SPEAKER_00]: made me very much aware that we were
arresting 250 to 300,000 people a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing has gotten better in spite of
the hundreds of thousands of us who work
[SPEAKER_00]: endlessly and have been working for
generations to change these laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: In spite of that the lies continue,
they still have the same arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is that now because of the
youth learning from us, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s, because of the dedication that comes
with that youth, because of a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility that comes as a result of
using marijuana, because once you enhance
[SPEAKER_00]: your awareness level by opening those
receptors, which you didn't use before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you become more aware of your
responsibility towards yourself and the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is for that reason that I am saying
now that you know and now that you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands of us who have been
arrested repeatedly, we have joined this
[SPEAKER_00]: war, we've been forced to fight this war
on us that they call the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs are not going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 million of us have been arrested,
2,000 every day still today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot afford this prohibition at a
moral level, at a medical level,
[SPEAKER_00]: at a financial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to you to join those hundreds
of thousands of us who have been working
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, most of us were not
necessarily willing victims.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were hammered with a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had no choice but to stand up for our
self-preservation and survival instincts,
[SPEAKER_00]: which of course cannot be outlawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot outlaw self-preservation and
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you're asking us to do if
you maintain these laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please join us in this nightmare,
whether you're in Alaska, whether you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York, whether you're in Oregon,
whether you're going to make it legal for
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone over 40, or whether you're still
working on the medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all urgent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message needs to be loud and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Substance Control Act is the hammer
that shot that coffin for us back in 1970
[SPEAKER_00]: when Richard Nixon hired a team of his own
friends to tell him marijuana should be
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalized, that it was no danger to
anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided he was not going to reward
the hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what were they called then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitnicks, who had stopped his war on
Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he appointed Elvis Presley as his
first drug czar.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how that went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignorance blinds us, is what that proves
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have broken through the dark night
of ignorance when you made California
[SPEAKER_00]: legal back in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark night of ignorance has ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dawn of day is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all up to you to bring it into
its full, beautiful sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to end this prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all levels, hemp should be a vital part
of our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our farmers should be making money,
not being thrown in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need homes that are much harder to
burn down these days, especially in dry
[SPEAKER_00]: areas like Arizona, California,
even a lot of fires in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just fires all over that could be
alleviated a great deal by building
[SPEAKER_00]: properly and not use so many chemicals
everywhere for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in every three of us is expected to
have a cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have been to a medical
conference where some of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliant people stated very clearly that
today each and every one of us has a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to acquire a cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of it has to do with substituting
this one plant with over 50,000
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemical products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, the ones of us who keep our
immune system by using this plant stand a
[SPEAKER_00]: better chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A chance of not getting the cancer,
although there's plenty of it to go around
[SPEAKER_00]: to all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please help us alleviate, help our
planet, help the people and stop this
[SPEAKER_00]: madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida is trying to make sure that other
people have a right to cultivate and
[SPEAKER_00]: possess their medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we're with them in spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am there in the spirit of gratitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the ones who made it happen for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, so I know they're
compassionate people if given the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education is the key to all the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what all the elders have taught me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them were younger than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, my elders turned out to be kids
from 18 to 25 that took to that road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did every state in this country
repeatedly for two or three years and then
[SPEAKER_00]: joined the hemp museum or he joined us
actually with the cannabis action network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we continued to travel the country for
another year or two after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All with the purpose of educating America,
learning and teaching as quickly as we
[SPEAKER_00]: could pass it on to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has paid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you on my side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What surprised me was the reception that
we got as we traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, oh, what are those old
people talking to us about me?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all ears because they were not
getting education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a poor excuse for education.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very sad to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, the stories these kids could
tell us of horrible parenting they had
[SPEAKER_00]: until 10 years ago when their daddy gave
up the booze and started smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only now they had to say goodbye to him so
he could throw him in jail for actually
[SPEAKER_00]: taking care of himself for once and for
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to teach these children that
not to give up, that they can change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a bad story, but they need to
share it with legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to put an end to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings us to a very interesting part
of this prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the states where we have ended medical
marijuana prohibition, we have dropped in
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoses by pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean a whopping 26% we've dropped
plus, 26 plus percent, considering that
[SPEAKER_00]: 78% of all deaths that are drug-related
are with legal drugs and prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to take note in the
states where medical marijuana is a
[SPEAKER_00]: reality, we have dropped a 26 plus
percentage of drug overdoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is God's precious herb gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it in the spirit of Thanksgiving
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis does have accepted medical value
thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, 24 states have accepted it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more will after this election.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt in my heart about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And may the true spirit of love be your
guiding light and end this madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
