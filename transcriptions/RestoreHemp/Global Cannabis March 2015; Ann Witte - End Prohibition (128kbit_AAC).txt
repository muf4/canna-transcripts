[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to talk just a little bit about
the hemp stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been denied the permit to put on
hemp stock this year, some of you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked the court to review the
decision-making process of the park
[SPEAKER_00]: service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds to me like hearing Madeleine
here today, hearing her say, don't smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, put your joint down,
that doesn't sound like Madeleine I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds to me like her free speech
rights have been tampered with,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like Paul Stanford's were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're told what to say from the stage now
by the city, but we filed a suit for a
[SPEAKER_00]: written review and we argued it last week,
had a little flurry of brief writing after
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should get a decision next week whether
there will be a hemp stock 2015 or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the reason it was denied is because
some people smoked marijuana down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: waterfront, so that's probably why
Madeleine is having to warn you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city can crack down on us any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free speech in the state of Oregon,
however, we have a constitutional
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment, constitutional provision that's
not even an amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a similar case under the
federal law out of Ferguson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed that the police officers in
Ferguson were telling people to move
[SPEAKER_00]: along, move along, move along,
keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stand here and talk about the
shootings, you can't talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: government, you can't talk about anything,
just keep moving, keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sued in federal court and just
quite recently last year, the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: court said, no, you can't make people just
keep moving along.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not narrowly tailored to solve your
problems, it just stops them talking and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't stop people from saying what
they want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that that's the same result
we'll have next week and that we'll all be
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteering and planning for hemp stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, keep speaking, because that's
what got us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
