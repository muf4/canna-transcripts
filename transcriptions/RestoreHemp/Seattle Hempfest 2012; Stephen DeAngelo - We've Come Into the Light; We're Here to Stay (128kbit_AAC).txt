[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vivian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, give yourselves a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I remember, I remember the first
few Hempfests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when we measured our numbers in
the hundreds, but it didn't stay that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew to measure Hempfest in the
thousands and the tens of thousands and
[SPEAKER_00]: now Hempfest is measured in the hundreds
of thousands of attendees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the progress of our movement
has mirrored the growth of Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the beginning of Hempfest,
we've passed medical cannabis laws in 17
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more to come this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from the East Coast to the West
Coast, from Michigan to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: from New Jersey to Washington,
patients can obtain their medicine in
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, well-regulated access points.
[SPEAKER_00]: They no longer need to negotiate the
perils of the underground market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They no longer need to worry about getting
short-wave or getting contaminated
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine or having a knife or a gun pulled
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have created tens of thousands of
well-paying jobs and access points across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those access points have generated
hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: for our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reduced the burden on law
enforcement and we've made our
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhoods safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have proven, we have proven that
cannabis can be distributed in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: brings benefits to communities instead of
harms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the guardians of public
safety up there in the high levels of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorneys, they don't think these are good
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so last year, they launched a
coordinated multi-agency nationwide attack
[SPEAKER_00]: on our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that attack started out in Michigan
and Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when nobody noticed, when there was no
public outcry, when there was no blow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the media, the feds expanded this
campaign to California where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: closed 400 access points with threats of
seizing their property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few weeks ago, Harborside Health
Center became the latest target of this
[SPEAKER_00]: federal attack when they served papers on
us to seize the property that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: located in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have no intention of closing our
doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will never abandon our patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use every legal means at our
disposal to contest this action on the
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nothing to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that justice is on our side and we
look forward to our day in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since Harborside was served,
this campaign of the feds unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: has mustasticized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a malignant cancer, it continues to
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten threats went out in Colorado recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just last week, I'm sorry to say,
it spread here to your own state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington when the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney in the Eastern District served
forfeiture notices on four access points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, three of them have already closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to let them get away with
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: No way we're going to let them get away
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they can crush us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we crushed?
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are roused.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are roused to our righteous fury now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not be crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, after Harborside was served
with these despicable notices,
[SPEAKER_00]: offers of assistance poured into us from
all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single activist organization you can
imagine got in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had simultaneous demonstrations in four
different states, including a courageous
[SPEAKER_00]: takeover of the Obama campaign
headquarters right here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that support, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are pulling together and we have a
common message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to send it clear and
loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to tell President Obama that
it is time for him to keep the promise he
[SPEAKER_00]: made to us, to our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for him to call off these rogue
prosecutors and stop this horrible,
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made too much progress to go
backwards now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All across this country, we've built laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've passed laws and built systems of
distribution that have allowed patients to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of the shadows of the underground
market and come into the light of safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: compassionate access centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're never, ever going back into those
shadows again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're going to remain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to speak to me a little
more, come check me down at the dope booth
[SPEAKER_00]: at the back of the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
