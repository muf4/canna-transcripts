[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so for those that don't know,
my name is Jesse Spomberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lifelong resident of Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medical marijuana patient and I'm
running for mayor of Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm running on a couple basic
platforms like social justice and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental stewardship and
accountability and transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my biggest platforms is
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all love marijuana,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to a lot of debates these days and
everybody always asks the question of me
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always say, how are you going to
create more revenue for the city?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always got two answers,
either cut programs or raise taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sit there stoned and I think to
myself, do you guys not know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized that they really
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's survived the last couple
years of debacle trying to get the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: stock permits understands how little the
people that are making the decisions for
[SPEAKER_00]: our city really understand about
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shocked to find out that none of the
five people on city council had ever even
[SPEAKER_00]: been to hemp stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out the other day that Ted Wheeler
and Jules Bailey never ever smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jules Bailey, in fact, voted against
measure 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow those two guys got the
marijuana lobbyist endorsements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the guy speaking at the freaking
global cannabis march.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cash ruins everything around us people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my transition right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my whole life, my grandmother
and all her hippie friends, all they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted was to legalize a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's all we wanted,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free love, two fingers, legalize a plant,
let everybody have it, reduce the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: it as a commodity, make it no more
important than any other garden crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would share with your neighbors,
like zucchinis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you get too many tomatoes,
you share them with your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But greed has touched everything around
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's the lobbying interests
that are messing this shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't believe that,
then you have to, all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: ask yourself, why the hell would Ted
Wheeler get an endorsement from the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't we understand that money is what's
ruining all of us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just our politics, but our personal
freaking hash pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all intersectional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greed ruins all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two points I want to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they relate to greed, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is some of you guys are
really disappointing me, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, legalization is brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows when you go to free marijuana
Mondays how to act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you stand in line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you yell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you trample?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you smoke on premises?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come to a place like this,
do you yell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you heckle?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing hash deals with people,
how do you act?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's our job in this new frontier to
create the social norms and the rules by
[SPEAKER_00]: the way shit operates, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we're doing a very good
job of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are really disappointing me with
all the stories that I hear about people
[SPEAKER_00]: burning each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: People like Anthony Hardy and Anthony
Shanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up this morning to find out another
dispensary burned another friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit is shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it's because you all
smoke too many dabs and that shit's like
[SPEAKER_00]: crack, but I mostly stick to flour so I
can see how this is turning into a
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous subculture of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No different than the dope game or the
crack game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to be like the dope
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be the old ladies smoking
freaking fat joints on the backyard with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bug light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's okay because growing pains are
natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time last year, it wasn't even
legal to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I started daydreaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are the ones who have the
responsibility and this brave new frontier
[SPEAKER_00]: to set the standard for how you behave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason that I want you to elect me
the mayor is because our city council is
[SPEAKER_00]: not supportive of the small business
aspect of the marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now listen, I don't want you
misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any jurisdictional authority
over the OHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any jurisdictional authority
over the legislators down in Salem that
[SPEAKER_00]: are screwing us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have the voice or I will have the
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a soapbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine the soapbox that I would have
as the mayor of Portland turning Portland
[SPEAKER_00]: into the biggest marijuana capital in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason that we can't just take
everything over, have the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: festivals, the most beautiful hemp stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now if you're a tourist and you come
to Portland, Oregon, there is nowhere that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to one of our beautiful
dispensaries, you buy a nice $7 effing
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cash ruins everything around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, okay, you buy a $7 joint,
where are you gonna smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke it on a sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke it in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke it in your rental car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you with me, Steve Wessing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke it in your damn hotel
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta go smoke in a closet with Steve
Wessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come out the closet, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, guys, enough about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get so sick of talking about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please keep me on your radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jesse Sponberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The election is on May 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what day it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's 10 days left till the
election.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should already have your ballots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mark Jesse Sponberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully mark Bernie Sanders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
