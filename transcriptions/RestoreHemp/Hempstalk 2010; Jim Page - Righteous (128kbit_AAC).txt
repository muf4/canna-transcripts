[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempstead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played that Seattle Hempfest for years
and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started out as a little place up there in
Starlight Mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller than this, even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way up there in the Cascades, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be getting cold this time of night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be hunkering down in your sleeping
bag in your tent, taking in a little nip
[SPEAKER_00]: of something to keep warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: A song from back in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a little song that you might
get along with all about a natural seed
[SPEAKER_00]: growing wine by the side of the roadway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nature's a wonderful weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been around so long, it's hard to tell why
any woman think it's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it or hate it, however you relate it,
I'll leave that up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the way it ought to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now history's locked in the cardboard box
and it's hard to take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: With sidetracked frills and fantasies all
written all over the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody tells you what to think and
they've got their reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta pick reality up by the scruff of
the neck and look it right in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the way it ought to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the same people that are spreading the
fear, the same people that scare me the
[SPEAKER_00]: most.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of them look like they just
assume like to hang it from a lamppost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about what it does to your
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just have to react because Hitler
never touched the stuff and that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: actual fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the way it ought to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now George Washington was the father of
our country and he had a hemp plantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy Ross used it to make the flag that
flew above the baby nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote their declarations on paper
from that same hemp fiber press and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what they smoked when they were
taking a break, but I got a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the way it ought to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it'll calm you down when you're too
uptight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just might make you smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the seed oil in your engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll lubricate the miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glaucoma and chemotherapy, they say it
smooths out the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time you meet a cancer patient,
ask them what they think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the way it ought to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why some people get so upset
when you say to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd rather build more jails,
arrest more people, and spread more crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like talking to a brick wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just don't get the facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they ought to try a little of that
Betsy Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just might help them relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the way it ought to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is just a song about a plea for
common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little common sense, a little bit
of slow down on the pick them up and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: them away and lock the door kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I've just about had my say now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get beyond my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people don't like the kind of
things I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got mine and you got yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give what we can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time I need a breather,
well, I might just take a little smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the way it ought to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that righteous?
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Righteous is good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
