the same thing that I'm going to be doing
in the future, and doing something to my
passion.
I don't know
if I could be able to do it myself,
but I feel like I should be able to work
on it.
And I can't really say how I'm going to do
it, it is all up to me.
I can't really say I'm going to do it out
of activism,
but I'm going to be doing it.
I'm going to be doing it.
I'm going to be doing it.
I'm going to be doing it.
so I'm just going to share a few things.
And I said, come on, let's get 60,
70 dollars in our ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that I asked myself,
okay, come on, let's get 60, 70 dollars in
[SPEAKER_00]: our range, and I said, okay, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.
And I put my friend in the room and told
him to go and come up around town and down
[SPEAKER_00]: the trees to get the change.
And I went over and thought, we need to go
in the United States, and he just kind of
wants to go in the United States,
because you don't need to be far right
now.
So, in the
cloud of integrity and his son,
with his son, to me, it would be just as
if he can just like, wow.
Like, cool.
You know, it's all good.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: សក្្។ ល្ វ។
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, there's so much data
coming back to the university history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, so many, so many years did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she took me to a place called the West
Expo in Stockholm.
At the time, we saw all these copy-outs in
the US in 1967.
And it was at the bottom of my head,
we were like, wow, that's a lot of data.
And I was like, wow, there's so much data
coming back to the university history.
And I said, so many, so many years did it.
And she took me to a place called the West
Expo in Stockholm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was there.
or the spade around the cigarette smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these places packed every day,
hippies, punk rockers, poets, or you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just these things, you know,
it's just these authors, writers,
ball players, test players, everything,
that kind of thing.
There was no hands behind that,
you know, plastic, sort of thing.
And this was like, this is how I had to be
able to get in and out.
This is just about all aspects of the
working world.
It comes down to whether or not we're
ready for glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was the pain of killing my
parents from a racer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that happened first,
to glory.
And I was teaching for the first time when
I was in 90s school.
It's true, you know, electric billy and
all of that.
And all of that happened soon,
to glory.
So I went up to my parents and said,
hey, it's going to be a tough challenge
out there.
And they said, all right, we'll just add
electric cell phone.
We'll just add electric cell phone.
And that's how I went back.
And it's through my application that I
knew it was that, that, that.
So I sent it back and went back again,
just to get it done.
So I went back, to my cell phone,
and I told my parents, you know,
this is what I wanted to do, as well as
the working world.
So I went to university, just to start
cell phone teachers.
And it was a difference in work,
you know, work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's best way since then, to start
working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to my parents, and I was
like, there was pain, and there was shock,
people didn't hear me say it.
So I went there, I went there,
and I asked the staff, I went there,
and I go in.
We actually went back to Mexico City
College.
We went both to, I was in the college,
and we went to Mexico, so I was there with
everything that you see with the aircraft.
I think people familiar with the first
time, a few million years.
And there was this, it was this character
aspects, you know, this was a character
people, I think they knew what it was.
So I got on this guy and made him get
activist and kind of go, this is how I go
through the actual work on a basis.
And I did some TV, too, and I did a couple
of these and that's a way I got people to
play with.
So I worked with everybody, you know,
I worked on a couple of news years,
some years ago.
but I really hope to see you soon as this
goes and to see you soon as we work on it
and I just thought I'd offer you a hand in
kind of social media.
I have a computer which I use,
you know, which is basic, but I can do a
little bit of work on it and I'll show you
some of the support that I have.
And I'm just going to take it out and at
the same time, I'm just telling you what's
coming.
You know, I'm doing what's coming.
I'm going to tell you, I'm just going to
pull up and you will see what's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to pull up and you will see
what's coming.
I'm just going to pull up and you will see
what's coming.
We have something in the middle here which
is like social work and teamwork and
people want the PC without having to fall
into this idea of the absence of something
that is really, really simply that lesson
taught.
I was working virtually with you,
I was doing my thing and I thought about
lecture rooms and then we saw PC's.
And it was this one that we saw.
We just had these famous people,
rejects and hippies and pot rockers and
happiness and resources and actually we
collect the resources that people also
give to our young mothers and also to
young mothers, also to young children,
also to young businesses and patients.
The service, the process, resources,
money, money, people are using resources
on the street.
They're not only services in the local
communities or something like that.
So, the service is important, it can't be
on every stage in which it is going,
going back.
So when we got back in the early 30s,
we had a big pile of some of them.
We started to do some of the tabloids,
and some of them were spot.
And we had a pilot show, teaching his
crisis guide, crisis resource director
guide.
And I can tell you maybe some of the other
copies of the first edition.
And since that time, we've been showing
just some of the data from one panel to
another, copies of this, you know,
teaching his crisis guide.
You know, we have to come up with the list
of the things that we had first done in
tabloids.
And so we showed these services to a
sexual minority, but that did not already
get out in the public.
And we found that that could still be seen
in the early stories.
So we had a self-crisis program.
And we did a piloted show as well.
A piloted show was done.
And I can say it's been amazing.
And she's shown the kinds of places.
It's funny.
We have a piloted show in the back of the
tunnel.
And it's a pilot.
And I can see one of the faces.
Oh, and the PC inside.
And we have a really cool style actually.
The pilot just came up and he was showing
us how he really did.
And he just did, and he did.
And that's a pilot.
So we went on and we did the spaces.
And then we had a suite where we just had
him talk about what he was doing.
And he was showing us what he was doing.
and he'd carry his cans and put them in
his paper boxes and everything,
and then we had the economic days were
changing, you know, people were in just
[SPEAKER_00]: social, and we saw that we were having a
lot of things, and we thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we saw we were having a lot of
things, but it was just very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: low-risk, and then we lived.
So we had a lot of people that come out
with disabilities, some of them had a
teacher, and some of them spoke,
and they changed, you know, I'm going to
go over some of the really obvious things
about Christchurch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here comes from the Middle East,
from South Asia.
And what I found is that these people,
these people that nobody had interested
in, nobody had any resources in the
partner, I thought they asked for it in
the early Indonesian and Indonesian
direction.
But I didn't chance to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have had more kind of a simple
structure of something that didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose or a focus in something that would
have happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
And I said, now I have to do something
with our country, and now they are being
conducted.
And it plays a lesson to me.
We have to do this in the early Indonesian
and Indonesian direction.
So we don't really have these people.
We actually have some people that we
already have built and we already do
something with them.
We already have a person.
And that's really what this kind of thing
is.
I think it just would work the way it's
worked.
Do you see how that kind of thing seems to
work out there?
And that's why I really started.
And I'm actually, I'll tell you something
that's kind of out there.
When we were in the first post-war era,
there was this president, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we came in, we were pretty strict to
Christchurch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still happened.
It did.
In Christchurch, it didn't come down to
anything.
There was so much, you know, a lot of
Christchurch, a lot of Christchurch
districts coming out in 1990.
And I was kind of like, I was kind of like
an Indonesian person.
But at the end of that, we also had a lot
of guys that were smart to say,
I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.
We had a lot of kids in the years that
were in good, well, better than kids being
in Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be a little more systematic and be
a little bit more direct to this country.
And doing that in kind of a south-east
country, says it's kind of our next kind
of north-east country.
And we've got our next kind of a new
world.
So these people said, I know we should
start a rest town, rest city country,
a political protest.
Like, what are we going to do?
So what are we going to do?
We're going to do what?
How are we going to do it?
So by the time that we start to go like
that, too, that way, it's going to be a
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that's done, the plastic
surgery shows up, the administration shows
[SPEAKER_00]: up, it's been charted, it's like,
what's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to go right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I believe is that the way in
which we're going to be handling all this
is the clinical application.
I remember just going to the lab,
and you saw the lab, and someone in the
lab was always telling us, oh,
oh, oh, oh, clinical application.
I remember just going to the lab,
and you saw the lab, and you saw the lab,
and you saw the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you saw the
lab, and you saw the lab, and you saw the
lab, I just want to say that the work that
I have done is really amazing,
really incredible.
There's already these people who are
really interesting and really valuable,
and I think that we've got enough for us
to really change things up.
I think that our extraction of the area
we've done has really been a great thing.
And I think that from the best we can do,
we're really looking at the situation that
these people are in.
The situation that we're in is a lot
different than the kind of things that
we've been doing in the past, and also
different.
But the situation is that there are some
ways to help out and to bring in the full
I think there was a couple of times that
people felt so lonely, lonely,
lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely,
lonely, lonely.
And that kind of feeling was there.
and the positive energy is so strong,
that it's a lot of energy that's going to
be there during the year.
The other side of it is that we had a
festival year earlier.
We had a scene of all kinds of benefit
shows, and we were not in the act.
We were going to see the meditations for
about two, three years at this point.
And so we had a couple of these people
that the president is talking to,
and they were like, we're going to have a
dinner tonight.
We're going to have a meeting.
Talk about the success story.
We're going to have a show.
And we're talking about the event story.
So we were, of course, in hotel,
wear old books, we had wellies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's little labs, so I was sitting
in the room and I had to wear more
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes, just like if I was sitting there,
I had to wear more clothes.
He was giving out doctorate and seats.
So I had aensible seat in the room and I
was just laying by the chair, I kept
seeing more connects there, and it was
easier to explain.
I'm asking you to see me.
You're going to get asked to see me,
we're going to just be public kissing you,
you're going to be standing there and
seeing me.
You're not to talk to me, you're not to
kiss me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm stuck in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so going to see you.
No, you're not going to kiss me.
ប ប ប ប ប ប ប ប
ប ប ប And so, that's something that we've
got to trace.
You've got to find that current idea.
And that's really the only two things that
you have to follow.
But, you know, I think you want to go down
to the current time, you know,
the time that you're going to travel home.
And it's time that you're going to get the
keystones of all the other ideas.
You can reach them in the present
day, you don't have to do it in the
present day, you can do it in the future.
So, you know, basically the keystones of
all the other ideas.
c'est la question de la question de la
question in your face.
And we're so sorry to pick up on this,
but we're going to stick to our diet and
the actual way of transformation.
We're going to be able to direct a lot of
positive energy.
We're going to be able to direct a lot of
positive energy.
