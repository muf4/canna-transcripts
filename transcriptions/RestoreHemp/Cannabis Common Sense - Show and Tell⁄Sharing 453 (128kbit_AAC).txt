[SPEAKER_02]: These antique medicines, you'll see things
for delirium tremens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's a side effect of quitting
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see it says it's for getting off opium
and nicotine and chloroform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it helps with that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is a Eli Lilly bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a couple of Eli Lilly bottles in
the collection here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is extract number 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right next to it is extract number 17.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Eli Lilly had a variety of different
medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll show some others on some other
shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have a hypno sedative with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has chloroform and bromide,
which the chloroform alone, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: will knock you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for migraines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here it shows they were using cannabis
for migraines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they mixed this with aspirin,
basically, extracted cannabis and aspirin
[SPEAKER_02]: pill from Sharpen Dome of Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right next door we have another
Sharpen Dome cannabis extract bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Mulford Company in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these bottles date from 1870 to
1910.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is about 1905.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like this one because they call it
American Hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cannabis grown here in the good
old US of A.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a really interesting list of
things I won't go through right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I eat these regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're shelled hemp seeds from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can find them in a lot of
different stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you press your hemp seeds and take
out the oil, you have a high protein flour
[SPEAKER_02]: left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's hemp flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make hemp protein drinks,
hemp patties and burgers, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's one, a couple of different
versions of hemp milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one from Living Harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one from Manitoba Harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all made up in Canada because we
can't grow this stuff in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Drug Enforcement Administration
doesn't think we can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to get Octopaste and we're
going to be able to grow it right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the great state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need your help out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need you to come and
volunteer because we need money to make
this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to create new jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to create new industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put Oregon on the cutting
edge of some exciting new environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: and economic development.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will benefit our state a great,
great deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally see us creating an industry
here of wood products, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we've got all the pieces in place for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the workers who have that
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can put people to work at the
state garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything made with petrochemicals can be
made with hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look forward to it.
