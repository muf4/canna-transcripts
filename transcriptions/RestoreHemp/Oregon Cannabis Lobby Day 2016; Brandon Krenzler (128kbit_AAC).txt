[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Brandon Krenzler,
and I'm here representing Parents for Pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the executive director of the National
Organization that supports the family
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I stand here feeling pretty
apathetic, just like most of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted for a law that protected our
medical program that's been in existence
[SPEAKER_00]: for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worked very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helped a number of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grew up, I was told that we lived
in a democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we live in a capitalist
patriarchy because the only way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything done is to fund it with our own
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a rich person.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us are rich people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people getting any traction with
our legislators are our biggest lobby
[SPEAKER_00]: groups here in Oregon that are funded by
our own industry that are actively
[SPEAKER_00]: advocating for the dissolving of our
medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to come together and get right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to ensure that what we
voted for is going to be what goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need our medical program to stay here
for the benefit of our parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: of our children, of everybody in our
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the program, anybody under the age
of 21 loses their safe access.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't leave school and come here and
tell these people how it benefits their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't afford to leave our jobs every
single day that they have these meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: to remind them of who we are and the voice
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to take time out of our day to
come here and do things on the steps like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shouldn't have to be we voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to penalize the places in our
state that aren't allowing our program,
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't allowing our legalization,
that aren't allowing anything but
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous persecution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that 3% away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people in those counties that
voted yes, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is corruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need an end to the corruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a voting year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them earn our votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
