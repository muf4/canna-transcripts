[SPEAKER_00]: And guys, I want to reach out to all of
you here today on this gorgeous day in
[SPEAKER_00]: this gorgeous park and ask you to remember
all of the eyes of the nation are on us
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have in front of us guys a chance to
continue the work that you did 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago when you brought one of the nation's
first medical marijuana bills to this
[SPEAKER_00]: country here in the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of work that you have done,
every member of the Seattle delegation to
[SPEAKER_00]: Olympia like Senator Colwell, she just
spoke to you, is in favor of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a year ago, they went on the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now every single elected official,
because of your work, because of you
[SPEAKER_00]: picking up the phone, because of you
getting active, every elected official in
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle City Hall is in favor of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, because of the work of people
like you, volunteers, activists,
[SPEAKER_00]: who went out and hit the streets and got
hundreds of thousands of signatures last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, in less than three months,
people, we get to vote for the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: any state in this nation to legalize
marijuana for adult recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I-502 and it must pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys, as Vivian said, my office
handles lots of legal matters for this
[SPEAKER_00]: great city and for its citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is that I'm the chief
criminal prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that I'm responsible for
public safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I'm supposed to hold
accountable people who would endanger the
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when adults use marijuana in a
responsible fashion, it's just wrong to
[SPEAKER_00]: label them criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why three years ago in my campaign,
I promised to never file another marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: possession charge again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've kept that promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as I'm your city attorney,
I will keep that promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guys, don't take this for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This beautiful park, this great festival
that we're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, you can still be arrested in
Seattle for possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I'm on charge, you can still
be arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you go beyond Seattle,
it's a completely different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so don't take this for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to recognize there is one
opportunity on the November ballot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is to vote yes on 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: And send a clear message, a clear message
along with Colorado, along with Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell the federal government that
prohibition is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for it to come to an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need to come together on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hempfest has been home here for
21 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And medical marijuana is something that
the city of Seattle has tried to make
[SPEAKER_00]: available for all of its patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other cities are cracking down on
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cracking down on patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, I'm just one prosecutor in
just one city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that we change
the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough to elect a good
prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to change the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're here to talk about
with 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a complete solution to
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written, supported, and passed by the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just for people here in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for Wenatchee, and Spokane,
and Chehalis, Auburn, and Kent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a challenge to the root problem
of federal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients and recreational users alike,
when 502 is passed, will have real arrest
[SPEAKER_00]: protection, real arrest protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what 502 will do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will send that message to
Washington, DC that prohibition is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up now, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, this November, we have a
chance to redirect law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: priorities, to make sure that we reclaim
industrial hemp for the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure that we have a yes on 502
and send the message along with Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
