[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Representative Blumenauer,
for hosting this event today and for
[SPEAKER_00]: inviting us all out and for your
leadership, really, in Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working in industrial hemp for
over 20 years, and specifically on the
[SPEAKER_00]: political side of it for about the last 13
with vote hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got to tell you, it's been a
long, hard slog.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started this, we thought,
oh, yeah, we'll probably have this
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized in five years or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are 13 years later,
and we're still pushing hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really nice to sort of see how
things are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to get into the
mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the very beginning, Ron Paul was
our first co-sponsor of a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation, interestingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did it at the request of Ralph
Nader, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyways, nobody really wanted to work
with Ron Paul back in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you may have been one of our first
10 or 15 co-sponsors back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, I also want to thank the
entire Oregon delegation, because really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are very fortunate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of leadership here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator Wyden has led in the Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in the delegation is,
with the exception of Representative
[SPEAKER_00]: Walden, is a co-sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Representative Walden did vote for the
farming amendment that was on the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Oregon has been a real leader state on
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to mention and just
recognize Senator Brzezinski, who is state
[SPEAKER_00]: senator here, who led here in the state
legislature and got hemp passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put the bill up a number of times,
I think at the request of Carolyn Rand and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe Jerry Shapiro down in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first it took two or three
sessions, never got through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, he finally pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's part of the reason we're
here today as well, with Oregon being one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the 10 states that actually has it
authorized in their state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as Representative Blumenauer
mentioned, this memo, this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic, because we've been working for
years to get the Justice Department to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states have tried to approach them
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the first U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney to make a public statement on
this, and this is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of opens the door for the
Department of Agriculture and other
[SPEAKER_00]: officials here in the state to say,
okay, now we've got a clear guideline for
[SPEAKER_00]: how this can work and how will we have to
do in order to make it possible for
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just reiterate a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farm bill amendment that passed was
not only bipartisan, but we had 63
[SPEAKER_00]: Republicans and 162 Democrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can find too many bills
that are passed in the House right now
[SPEAKER_00]: with that kind of bipartisan support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible, and we were just really
thankful for the group that brought that
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to emphasize that this is
only a first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: This research amendment is only going to,
it's going to crack the door open,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have got to get, we've got a bill
in the House, H.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: 525 and a bill in the Senate, S359,
and we have got to get those bills passed
[SPEAKER_00]: and get this put permanently into law so
that hemp is no longer confusing marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: and farmers have a clear path to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even with this research amendment
and this memo, we're still in a quasi
[SPEAKER_00]: legal situation, and it's going to still
make it difficult for farmers to go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a couple other things real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention the Hemp Industries
Association is holding a conference in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: next weekend, the 17th and 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody's interested, you can go to
the hie.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a lot of speakers there from
different areas talking about industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also doing a lobby day on the 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be going to the hill, meeting with
our representatives, and really pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: for the legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I'll like to mention
Hemp History Week, which is an initiative
[SPEAKER_00]: that HIA has been doing now, this will be
our fifth year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hemp History Week for 2014 will be the
second through the ninth of June,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's at hemphistoryweek.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to get involved,
we have opportunities to do local events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get involved, a lot of the stores are
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole Foods has been a great supporter of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, with that, I'll pass it
along to...
