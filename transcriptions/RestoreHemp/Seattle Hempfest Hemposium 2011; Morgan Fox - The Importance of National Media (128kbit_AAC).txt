[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, it's Morgan Fox, the communications
manager at the marijuana policy project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just kind of want to talk about
the television for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: National TV is probably one of the most
important media outlets that we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: after just because it gets the most number
of views.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clips from national TV are the ones that
get posted on blogs and get spread around
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what really grabs people's
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've definitely come a long way in
getting access to national media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in 2002, one of my predecessors
tried to call CNN to pitch a story,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the receptionist had to put him on
hold because she couldn't stop laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when she brought him back,
her response was, all right, Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana, what should I say you want to
talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2008, they were calling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've really come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we have access to it,
it's becoming very much a double edged
[SPEAKER_00]: sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become harder to control the
messaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And harder to get stories pitched the way
that we really want them to because,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, quite frankly, the media cares
about drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they care about is what's going to get
the most views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, they want drama and
conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trick is to try to get these guys
to focus on the conflicts that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: them to, as opposed to the conflicts that
they find the easiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we do that is,
I mean, first, developing relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: with producers to make sure that we can
pitch them the type of stories that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to, but also by creating our own
conflicts so that we can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: messaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means calling out legislatures in
public forums so that people will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask questions and maybe put them on the
spot a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it when politicians are
embarrassed and start stammering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of them just waiting for them to
find their own stories and going after
[SPEAKER_00]: things like conflicts within ballot
initiative campaigns or conflicts within
[SPEAKER_00]: the movement or that one dispensary owner
who's got a bunch of AK-47s in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get them to focus on the
conflicts that we want them to because
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the juicy stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really care about how this bill
is going along unless there's some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move forward and try to get more
and more media coverage for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, I mean, we can't find anybody
that's going to debate us on this issue
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be talking to producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, well, we want to do a
segment on this, but we can't find anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the other side of the debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Masquerade as a drug warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what about the children?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the things that we need to
really concentrate on, creating conflicts
[SPEAKER_00]: that the media wants to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means we have to really try to go
out there and embarrass the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are working against us, but of course,
in a polite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, no cream pies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's really all I've got.
If anybody has any questions, feel free.
Thank you.
