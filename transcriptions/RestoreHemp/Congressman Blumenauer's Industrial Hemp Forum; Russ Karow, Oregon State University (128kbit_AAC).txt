[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Russ Caro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm head of the Crop and Soil Science
Department at Oregon State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to do is spin off from
the product side of this and talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about some of the production realities
as far as we know them at this point in
[SPEAKER_00]: time here in Oregon and what that may mean
for hemp industry in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to align expectations at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crops, new crops, alternate crops are
nothing new to the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got at last estimate over 220
different crops that are being grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and natural resource products across
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over a hundred of those crops,
commodities that have a farm gate value of
[SPEAKER_00]: over a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike other parts of the nation where
the growers are faced with very few
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping alternatives, we have many
choices in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike growers in some other parts of
the nation, if you ask a grower here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you bring them something and say,
what do you think about chicory?
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions they'll ask are,
where can I get the seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell me about the production
conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is it worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when are you going to pay me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And from those four points, people can,
if it's something that is workable,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can pretty well figure it out and see
if it makes sense in our production
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've done in the back, I don't know
if everybody picked it up, but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: handout that has far more technical detail
than most of you are probably going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those that are interested in
thinking about producing hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd ask you to pick a copy of that up and
take a look at some of the information
[SPEAKER_00]: that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short story is that hemp is warm
season crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very similar to sweet corn,
soybeans, sunflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about the Willamette Valley,
and everybody goes, well, we grow corn in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Willamette Valley, but it's sweet
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not grain corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little grain corn grown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few sunflowers, very few soybeans,
and that's because of the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: regime that we all love in Western Oregon
and across Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Mediterranean climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainfall comes during the winter months,
and during the summer we have cool night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and moderate heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rarely, of late we've been getting up
into the 90s and hundreds, but generally
[SPEAKER_00]: we expect that the summer temperatures are
going to be in the high 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a corn plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum growing conditions for a corn
plant is if the nighttime temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: drops, drops below 50 degrees,
the plant goes into physiological shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not designed to grow with its
physiology at temperatures that low.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the top end temperature for something
like corn is 86 degrees, so it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly narrow range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that hemp has a wider range in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've not grown hemp here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've not grown current varieties,
but we can look at the information that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available from other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find in most plant biology,
plant physiology, is that you don't change
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be things at the edges,
and that's what we're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are well adapted to colder
night temperatures, shorter growing
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, looking at the information
we can find from both Canada and from
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe and trying to translate that into
an Oregon context, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard pushed to grow seeded hemp
here in the Willamette Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maturity, because of the temperature
regimes that we've got, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at maturation in late September,
October.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to mature a crop,
dry a crop down, you know what late
[SPEAKER_00]: September and October is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiber crop may be much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the varieties, the maturity
of the fiber occurs when the male flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plant have matured, so it's much
earlier in the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, you'd be looking at things in July,
August, which make much more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be able to easily grow fiber crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeded crops, getting both seed and
fiber, may be more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we have to think about is
we enjoy our dry summers, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow a crop during the summer,
actively grow that crop as industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: would be growing, you're going to need
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about the corn, the green
beans, the other crops that are out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: valley in the summer months, they're being
irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to figure out if
you're going to grow the crop on large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, where are you going to get the
water from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the question that other large
commercial, the current large commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are going to ask is, what's it
worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to pay me?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look at the production
economics of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I put my water on green beans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I put my water on sweet corn,
which are very high value crops versus
[SPEAKER_00]: something like hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think about some of those
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are other parts of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We very successfully grow corn in
Hermiston, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're further inland.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have a Mediterranean climate,
but those are heat pockets, as is
[SPEAKER_00]: southwestern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We very successfully grow corn in the
Hermiston area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set national yield records for 300,
320 and 25 bushel corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow hemp in that environment
very easily, but you're up against 300
[SPEAKER_00]: bushel corn at $5 a bushel at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're up against potatoes, carrots,
green beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the growers there are going to look
at, what does this crop bring me versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the value that I'm going to get out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Rick's area, we have grown dryland corn
in parts of the Columbia basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an experiment station called the
Morro Experiment Station, and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown dryland corn for the last four or
five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting about 35, 40 bushel corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen some of that that Brian
took out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're getting 300 bushels in
the irrigated area and you're getting 35,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 bushels in the dryland area,
again, align expectations for what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at as far as yields in those
possible situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess as I think about this,
we can do anything on small scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody is interested in growing a
crop in this state, we've got a pliable
[SPEAKER_00]: enough environment that you're going to be
able to grow what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to figure out where
you get the water from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to figure out how you
can plant it early, and what you could do
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as protecting the seed so that you
can get it planted and capture early
[SPEAKER_00]: season growing heat units.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways you can look at it,
but don't assume that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to immediately, once we've got it
legal to grow, that it's immediately going
[SPEAKER_00]: to move out into large scale production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about those things, align
expectations appropriately, and we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: in good shape.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
