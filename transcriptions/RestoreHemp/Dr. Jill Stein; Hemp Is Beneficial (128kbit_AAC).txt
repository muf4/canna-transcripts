[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only good for our health and
safety, it's good because it creates jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: and by legalizing hemp in particular we
create a whole industry because hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: really a gold mine of resources and as a
doctor and as a nutrition wonk you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: can testify that there are incredible
nutritional values to hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a whole set of fatty acids that
are really critical for our health that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not otherwise widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are very important nutritional
and food values to hemp as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: potential as fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its value agriculturally is especially
important in this day and age of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change where we have drought, we have heat
and all that and where the cost of fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: fuels are skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately with hemp it's a really stable
crop you don't need to irrigate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need fossil fuel based
pesticides and you don't need fossil fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: derived fertilizers either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's you know it's a really important
crop especially in this day and age of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change and likewise it's a really
important resource for manufacturing and
[SPEAKER_00]: Henry Ford in fact you know made entire
automobiles out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercedes-Benz still uses hemp as part of
the I think the panels in their
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing process so you know not to
mention its uses in fiber as well so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just a whole bunch of
manufacturing uses for hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be grown locally, it can be grown
by small farmers so this is a valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: resource that the American people should
not be deprived of because of obsolete laws.
