[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in this marijuana legalization
movement, like he said, since about 1964,
[SPEAKER_00]: long before most of you were born.
[SPEAKER_00]: My prayer in my entire adult life has been
to see marijuana legalized in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States before I have to leave this planet
and go on to the next one, like we all
[SPEAKER_00]: must.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my dream and my prayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to harangue you about
why marijuana should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like trying to tell some
angels why they should have wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I know all of us would rather
live in a world where we aren't terminated
[SPEAKER_00]: as criminals, where the police had no
business with what was going on inside our
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucking heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do the police have what goes on in
our heads?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day, I pray this will be over with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Michigan, I'm a medical marijuana
patient registered with the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my card on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Detroit, where I'm based, we're going
to vote for legalization in the city of
[SPEAKER_00]: Detroit this November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we'll probably win years and
years ago, we established in Ann Arbor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan, in 1972, a local ordinance that
made marijuana possession or sales of any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort subject to a $5 ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been in effect there for 40
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they raised it to $25,
kind of a nod to inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still just a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as good as it gets before you have
pure legalization, which I hope we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always wanted to go to the
Hempstock Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had the opportunity before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Paul Stanford invited me this
year and said, we're trying to pass our
[SPEAKER_00]: measure number 80 to legalize marijuana in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I wanted to be part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend a lot of time in Amsterdam,
where you just buy your weed over the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to be sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy some weed just to get high on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prices are something you can live
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one coffee shop here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity to visit last night
the world famous Cannabis Cafe here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the first one maybe in the
USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I live in a coffee shop culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day I go to the coffee shop,
get high, drink coffee, see my friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a civilized way to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm praying that y'all are going to
pass this legislation in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to have one preachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the necessity to register to
vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you aren't registered,
and then you don't actually vote,
[SPEAKER_00]: then these other idiots are going to
continue their tyranny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side, they vote every fucking
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They very rarely miss a vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we get our ass kicked all
the time, because we forget to vote,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we don't think it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they hoodwinked us into thinking it
wasn't necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I love democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great way to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: A democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to vote, but you got to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to use it, you got to register to
vote in a timely fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one piece of grandfatherly
advice I can convey to you this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I was reminding Paul
Stanford yesterday when we were on his
[SPEAKER_00]: television show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with the great American poet John
Trudell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was reminding my brothers that it
was poets who started the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allen Ginsberg, Edward Sanders,
they were in the very forefront of this
[SPEAKER_00]: movement way back in 1964 and 1965.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was right behind them coming out of
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had people here in Oregon like Ken
Kesey, who spearheaded this idea for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to remember, poetry comes into
this at the basic level.
