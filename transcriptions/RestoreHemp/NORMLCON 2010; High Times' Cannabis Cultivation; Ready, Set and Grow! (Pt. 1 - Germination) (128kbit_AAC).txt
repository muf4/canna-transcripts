[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome everybody to the Ready,
Set, Grow breakout session here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives me great pleasure to have put
this thing together and I don't think even
[SPEAKER_04]: just a couple of years ago this would even
be a possibility to have people speaking
[SPEAKER_04]: about growing for patients, the right ways
to do it, the safest ways to do it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and people that are willing to come out
and talk about that and how they're able
[SPEAKER_04]: to do that legally and the proper way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So without further ado, let me introduce
the panel here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Directly to my left, Ms. Jill from TGA,
Genetics TGA Seeds, is Team Green Avenger.
[SPEAKER_04]: A combination of Subcool and Ms. Jill and
Dioxide, a bunch of other guys and gals
[SPEAKER_04]: that are helping out for the medical
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're seed breeders, they're growers,
and they really do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're responsible for some really
amazing strains like Vortex, Jilly Bean,
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack the Ripper, Danny Boy, and the list
really goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're even in my Seabank Hall of Fame,
which I put together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really quite an honor that they're
here and I just want to introduce them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Subcool is also the author of Dank,
which is an amazing book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside the mind of a breeder and what
choices they make to create the strains
[SPEAKER_04]: that they make, and beautiful pictures as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we've got Rafael Martinez Jr.,
who is a patient caregiver for the state
[SPEAKER_04]: of Oregon and a major player with Oregon
Normal and a great dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm psyched he's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Rafael, or Junior, and then Igor
Recuse, an old friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's taking the place of Kyle Cushman,
who actually sadly could not make it up
[SPEAKER_04]: here for this seminar, but he is taking
the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's with Safe Harbor of Maine,
which is one of the first dispensaries on
[SPEAKER_04]: the East Coast in Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They only allowed eight dispensaries for
the whole state, and I think it's one per
[SPEAKER_04]: resident?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's one per county.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one per county and they already have
the caregiver as they've had the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: loss since 99.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a grow-your-own and the
caregiver system, and now they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even some of them, I think, will be able
to deliver the medicine to patients in
[SPEAKER_04]: their homes, which is really exciting for
us on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maine's really leading the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the California of our side of
the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's Igor.
[SPEAKER_04]: To his left, Jeremy Miller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy is not only the founder of Olympia
HemFest in Washington, he's also a great
[SPEAKER_04]: grower and the breeder of Seeds of Truth,
which is his medical marijuana seed
[SPEAKER_04]: outfit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been to Olly HemFest,
but I hear it's a great time, and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: looking forward to hopefully coming this
Saturday next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have a little under a couple hours
or whatever, so I want to get as much as
[SPEAKER_04]: we can out of everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we'll start at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, germinating seeds is really how
you embark upon this pursuit, because you
[SPEAKER_04]: can always buy cones from the dispensary,
and that's a good way also to get started
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes, but you can come with a lot of
problems, and it depends on who you get
[SPEAKER_04]: them from.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them can be susceptible to
powdery mildew or already have pests on
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of times they're just not,
they don't have the vigor that you get
[SPEAKER_04]: when you pop seeds and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I'm going to talk to Sub-Cole
right now, let him tell us about
[SPEAKER_04]: germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Danny.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's millions of ways to start seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see a lot of seeds start.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 20 strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see everything you can possibly see in
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first thing I would say is that
people try to do too much to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite picture is we sort seeds out
back, and underneath my barbecue grill and
[SPEAKER_03]: work it when it's 40 degrees in granite,
seeds will germinate, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't take anything to germinate
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times people will send me an
email that says, hey, I got your seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put them on a heat mat, I used this,
that, three drops of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nature didn't really need all
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are big fans of a product called Rapid
Rooters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what company makes them,
they're a small core club.
[SPEAKER_03]: We flip them upside down, we stick the
seed in and they germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really try to suggest that people not
use a lot of chemicals and products in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to aid germination because it simply
is not required.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really how I germinate seeds
and have for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more small point, a lot of people like
to put them in paper towels or plastic
[SPEAKER_03]: bags, zip lock bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine, but if you don't have a light
touch and as you're transferring the seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: from the plastic bag in the paper towel,
you can tear the seeds up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smash them or nick them with your
tweezers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think that's always the best
way if you're a big clumsy guy like me and
[SPEAKER_03]: your hands aren't on delicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't try to start moving seeds around
while you've got resin all over the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: because you'll kill your seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and Rafael, do you have any
seed germination tips or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kind of have the same theory
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really believe in using a lot of
chemicals when you do it on the old clumsy
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still use the seed bag, you know,
the paper towel, but I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the guy on your phone is older
than dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my dad, so he's taught me quite
a few things that I've learned that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed person with the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's the most common way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and so what's the importance of
growing from seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And explain what a mother plant is to
people too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't always have to grow from
a seed only to like just flower that plant
[SPEAKER_04]: and move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can keep those genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to go fast because I'm trying to
stick to point here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I covered this down in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's very interested in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with clones, there are
threefold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one is mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it when someone walks up and hands
me a bud and tell me it's California
[SPEAKER_03]: orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been growing California orange
for three decades and I know what it
[SPEAKER_03]: tastes like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the clones are very mislabeled and that
can be a problem if you're trying to make
[SPEAKER_03]: dentures or metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two is mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot see mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: My partner out there just got a bunch of
nice clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell OG cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are cuts that people drool and
salivate over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened was even with good
treatment, amazing mythology, he got a
[SPEAKER_03]: little spot of mildew and then he spent
the next six months getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you take clones in thinking that
you're going to save time, it's a very
[SPEAKER_03]: good possibility that you're going to
bring something into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main thing that we all are scared of,
mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mites are a part of growing cannabis
indoors and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a good climate in your grow
room, keep it 74 degrees all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let your temperature swing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can keep the mites down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you bring, say, Romulan cutting
into your house a year ago because it is
[SPEAKER_03]: an amazing strain and you really needed it
to make a strain and then you battle mites
[SPEAKER_03]: for a fucking year, you know, that's what
you're opening yourself up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start with seed, you don't have
to worry about mites or mildew or mold
[SPEAKER_03]: coming into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a grower from a 10 pack of good seeds,
you should be able to select three to four
[SPEAKER_03]: nice females, discarding the females that
are not nice or not what you want,
[SPEAKER_03]: and select the mother plant that you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is how we do it quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grow the plant at day 45.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know what the sex of the plant is.
[SPEAKER_03]: She takes clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has nice delicate hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we bud the plant out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We share the plant with our patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very lucky here in Oregon that we
just give our pot to our patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't charge for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we give pot away to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been finding ways to give our pot to
our patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like eight germs in the ashtray
that are not enough people's focus because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not used to being here in Oregon,
I don't guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But okay, so then we bud these plants out.
[SPEAKER_03]: She uses numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to use cool names.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Shaggy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of our new space queens.
[SPEAKER_03]: She squits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is on the cover of a magazine
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We planted five seeds, one of the seeds in
hermaphrodite, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: At five weeks, it was easy to get out of
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't want to talk about this,
but the dominant state of cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphrodite, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a grower, you just got to get rid of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we had two other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: One was cheese dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: One was purple dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We selected this fena, which I named
Shaggy because I like cartoons,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it tastes like grapes,
and it tastes like cheese, and it yielded
[SPEAKER_03]: three and a half ounces from dirt from one
single seed grown in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a special phenotype that we
won't get rid of, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got an amazing high, and we found
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that if you don't start the
seed and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've done my entire life,
and I urge you to do this if you guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: out there growing medicinal, start seeds,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a box of crackers, Jacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a seed guy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not saying buy my seeds,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of breeders out there,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I regrow other people's seeds all
the time looking for something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew DJ Short's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't find one I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bring this kid from the UK seeds called
Pine Queen.
[SPEAKER_03]: This kid's name is Sonic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something called Shimano times something
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, it's like the third best pot
I've smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can't find these things if you
don't start the seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from those seeds, you can get a good
mother plant, and from the mother plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can get an infinite amount of clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I wouldn't call it infinite,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to cover one more small thing
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't understand cloning,
and I really feel it important to address
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to keep a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here in Oregon, where we grow six
plants for each one of our patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't have a room full of five foot bot
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take clones just for before we bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have 12 strains in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take 24 clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty nice clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the fastest we keep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack's Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any people have heard of
Jack's Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the father of Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been cloned for two decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while I was in prison, other people
kept cloning it, and it came back to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant is exactly the same,
and this is what I wanted to explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the word clone is wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not making a copy of something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking a living piece of the plant,
living piece of DNA, and then it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: growing again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to stop calling them clones,
but you're not replicating something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the theory of copy versus a copy versus
a copy, it's false.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want healthy growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want really healthy growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sick clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would imagine most of us growing
here are not using big mother plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy, why don't you tell us a little bit
about the situation in Washington,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also if you have any tips on
germinating seeds, cloning, or mother
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very simplistic in the way I germinate
seeds, so I think the way that Subcool
[SPEAKER_05]: said was very adequate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeds have a figure that clones don't
have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, if you're starting a seed,
they take right off really vigorously.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're starting in water,
a rapid grouper like Sub did suggested,
[SPEAKER_05]: I see those things just sprout right out
and just take off very vigorously,
[SPEAKER_05]: because the seeds have just a vigorous
hybrid growth that the clones don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: After a certain time, they start to lose a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still great plants, but you won't
see them quite as big as seed streams,
[SPEAKER_05]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington state itself is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're able to grow 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're only able to care give for one
patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the problem that we see with that is
Washington state possession is nine-tenths
[SPEAKER_05]: of the law.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm care giving for another patient,
then technically I'm in possession of
[SPEAKER_05]: three plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though the law allows me to grow
for another patient, I still am fighting
[SPEAKER_05]: it in court.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to prove that I wasn't technically
in possession.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was growing these for somebody else,
and I wasn't consuming that medicine on my
[SPEAKER_05]: own behalf.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of strange dynamics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working on a dispensary law.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year, Senator Nicole Wells is working
on a dispensary law in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of aspects to this proposed
legislation that really worry me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking a lot of people to kind of take
a look at what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our chance to really define
what's going to happen here in the future
[SPEAKER_05]: in Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the legislators don't
take into account the stakeholders and the
[SPEAKER_05]: patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, really you feel a lot of times
they just make time for the big lobbyists
[SPEAKER_05]: or the people that have money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think in the next few years,
we're going to see a lot of interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: dynamics in Washington state, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds like it's turning around
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are getting more involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, right now, there's a lot of people
co-ops that are operating in Washington
[SPEAKER_05]: state.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot that's popular in Seattle,
the Spokane area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the one I wanted to call an area
called Sacred Plum Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we do all the reading and
everything for seeds that you generate.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what about, we were talking about the
importance of seeds and vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about germination?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's any tips that you might have about
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm a very simplistic
germinator, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go either with a paper type or old
school style or I'll start them right at
[SPEAKER_05]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have two ways that I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly, I'll do it the old school paper
tile way because half the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the record.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what about cloning?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do a lot of cloning?
[SPEAKER_05]: We do do a lot of cloning in the strains
that we have to keep them perpetuated.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we definitely love these seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a bigger, their clumps just
don't have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they come like the subset
disease-free.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, as subset also,
Jill takes the clones for them or the
[SPEAKER_04]: cuttings, rooted cuttings, however you
would want to refer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe you can give us a couple of just
step by step of how you go about creating
clones.
Well, it's important that we start out
with utensils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, sorry, we have sharp blades and
scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we take them at a 45 degree angle.
Check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we dip these in rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use gel, powder, or liquid,
and we prefer the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to take the soft cuttings and
usually off towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be healthy, nice green
coloring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to make sure that there is a
root bump that will be going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cubes so that I feel that that's a better
way to root the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we like to put those immediately under
fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put them in, we use this shoe box,
plastic shoe box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy it at the Dollar Tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we take two sides and we invert them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the lids off and throw them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just take two big sides and turn
them inside out together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we stick them under the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep the clones very damp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep them, you know, warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want them to get too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep them about 78 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in about three to seven days,
we have roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: The importance being on the humidity and
the warmth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you need to, if it's cold and
you're doing the cloning, get a cheap
[SPEAKER_04]: little heat mat that you plug in and put
that underneath the tray.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important that the roots in
that area and the water that they sit in
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever it is never get too cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to sound silly, OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I answer a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the main thing that I ask everybody
that have a problem with clones is do you
[SPEAKER_03]: own a thermometer?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I say, how was the
temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's about, no, you have to have a
thermometer.
[SPEAKER_03]: A phalangeometer is not a way to tell the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds silly telling you guys this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't tell you the number of people
that have had problems for months cloning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to coach them through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to Radio Shack, and all of a
sudden, they've got clumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got to have a thermometer and a
humidistat to find out what the
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature in the humidistat is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just say, well, they're kind of
warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Igor, you got any cloning tips?
Well, the rapid voodoo system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rapid voodoo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody seems to be a fan of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you pre-voicen them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: a pollinator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, what I said was the sponges are
inoculated with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually also have a little bit of a
mineral charge, too, to help the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other products on the market,
as well, such as Easy Roots that cost a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit less.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also pH pumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a nutrient solution,
it isn't exactly right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will balance itself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could also make sure that the medium
you can't oversaturate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The surrounding surface will float.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will lift itself up off the water and
balance itself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do a commercial for rapid roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so much nicer than anything we
ever had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would also probably all agree to
try to discourage the use of rock wool in
[SPEAKER_04]: that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, plants do root well in rock wool
because it's able to hold air and allow
[SPEAKER_04]: oxygen to the roots and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a really kind of toxic product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not kind of, but it's a toxic product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not good for you to be around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not good for you to throw it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So rapid rooters or Easy Roots or any kind
of organic alternative you can find are
[SPEAKER_04]: much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the truth is, you can just get the
little cups and fill them with soil and
[SPEAKER_04]: keep it moist and warm and plant the root
in that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The moisture level and the warm
temperature are what's important to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the roots to pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once they pop, now you're in the
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
