[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this is the right way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: War's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's everybody gonna learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: War's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Telling you about your brother.
War's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you cut up in the love.
War's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's all come together and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: These words just did not make it in their
head.
So many give, so many more than take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us all to turn up, it just has to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: War's over.
What's everybody gonna learn?
War's over.
Telling we gonna burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: War's over.
So yeah, let's party and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's party and get high.
Tell us all to turn up, it just has to be.
War's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about it makes you hit the story
yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to change it,
you have to be dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting way too concerned that it
ain't no lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all come together sooner, we all burn
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: War's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you be acting dumb.
Cause there ain't nowhere to run.
War's over.
Unless you cut up in the love.
It's the same old lie.
War's over.
So once again, let's get high.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So let's party and get high.
