[SPEAKER_00]: You know the main thing I've been
concentrating on the past few months is
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure 80 and we need everybody out there
to register and vote for Measure 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to legalize marijuana and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to create tens of thousands
of new living wage jobs and thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: new companies and several new industries
with hemp and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our initiative will allow adults to grow
their own without a license fee or
[SPEAKER_00]: registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our initiative will allow people to grow
hemp horticulturally and marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulturally where you can breed your
own strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to sell seeds and starts
without a license fee or registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to sell the buds then you'll
have to get a license to grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: process it, and sell it but it will free
it and no one will be going to jail for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there are dozens of people over a
hundred here in the United States right
[SPEAKER_00]: now serving a sentence of life without the
possibility of parole just for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never threatened another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never owned a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never stole anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in prison for growing a plant
that's the first agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been grown by people at least 12,000
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 30,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first cloth, the first rope,
the first paper were all invented from
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing about the low THC hemp let
me tell you it's BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp higher THC hemp will make more seeds
and more oil and marijuana prohibition is
[SPEAKER_00]: not about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They created this myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they made it illegal everybody knew
what hemp was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't have criminalized hemp so
they said they had a deadly new drug
[SPEAKER_00]: called marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that it's the oldest
agricultural crop and it produces more oil
[SPEAKER_00]: for fuel and food, more protein,
more fiber, more medicine than any other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken the first crop purposely
sown by humans, the one that produces more
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel, fiber, food, and medicine than any
other and they made it illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is because of economic and
political control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's about the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: trans, national, fascist, elite,
ruling class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will legalize marijuana but we need you
guys to register and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to vote for everything
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to vote for all those
judges if you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you but we need you to register
and vote for Measure 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if you have not got a ballot in
the mail in the past year, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-register because so many people get
thrown off the roll for being inactive
[SPEAKER_00]: voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've moved since you last voted,
you need to re-register.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have booths around here for our
initiative that you can register at but
[SPEAKER_00]: you can also go online to oregonvotes.org
and register right online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to, if each of you got ten
other people to register and vote and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody out here that's at least 18,
register and voted, we will win this
[SPEAKER_00]: election and restore freedom in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there are a lot of trends going
on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology has been growing exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we've seen it in the internet and
we're seeing it with genomic or biological
[SPEAKER_00]: tech, biotech where they're creating new
organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got nanotechnology tiny
microscopic machines and artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are converging.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next 30 years, the possibilities
are terrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't expand natural individual
rights to include freedom of thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom of consciousness, and the right to
get high, the future of freedom,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dystopian possibilities are grim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like the Terminator, and the Matrix
are just the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marijuana is a bellwether issue for the
future of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about freedom of thought and economic
and social justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So register and vote.
Thank you.
