[SPEAKER_00]: Who are some of your greatest inspirations
in our movement?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it doesn't have to be someone
that's hemp related, but who gets you
[SPEAKER_00]: going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, frankly, one of the best examples of
a really valuable, committed activist that
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in the entire country is Vivian
Peake, who puts his place online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of anyone who works any
harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all volunteer labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done it for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had some health problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing holds him back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the biggest marijuana protest in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my favorite day of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my favorite trip of the year I look
forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Vivian would be somebody who stands out
to show up when a person could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be unfair to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of people that contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the people that deserve the
most credit right now are the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are pushing us beyond medical use and full
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really admire the efforts we're
undergoing right now in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Oregon, California,
and Massachusetts to get initiatives on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ballot to legalize marijuana in all
five states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
