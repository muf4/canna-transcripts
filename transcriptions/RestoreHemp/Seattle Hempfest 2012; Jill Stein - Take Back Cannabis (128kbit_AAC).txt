[SPEAKER_00]: So we can fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say no to the politics of fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say no to that politics that tells you we
don't dare stand up for what we deserve
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jobs, healthcare, public higher education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of bailing out the crooks at the
banks who got us into this mess,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to bail out the students who are
living like indentured servants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can bail out the homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: The homeowners who are losing our homes by
the millions while the banks continue
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling in their trillions of dollars that
we paid them to stop the foreclosure
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't stopped it one bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this is why we made change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the ones we've been waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to my website, jillstein.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the team and let's start back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can change this breaking point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into a tipping point and take back
cannabis and medical marijuana and hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and the economy and the peace and the
justice we deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go Hempstead.
Go Hempstead.
