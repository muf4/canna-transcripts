[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for those of us who smoke
marijuana to get up, stand up,
[SPEAKER_00]: light up, and let the world know how we
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must come out of the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's true, by the way, that marijuana
smoking increases your appreciation for
[SPEAKER_00]: good food, for good music, and for good
sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are not bad goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those goals are quite worth pursuing,
but for millions of us, it enhances our
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to stand back a step,
to be a little detached, to view our
[SPEAKER_00]: personal life, to view our professional
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, tens of millions of Americans
smoking marijuana can be a positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: enriching experience, and we must develop
the courage to say that publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as gays and lesbians failed to win
their rights in this country, until large
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers of courageous individuals were
willing to come out of the closet,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what has to happen with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, you must vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't vote, you're part of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, when you vote, it's important
to let your elected official know how
[SPEAKER_00]: important this issue is to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, you must take a pledge that
you will never again vote for a candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: for public office that wants to treat you
like a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 26 million Americans smoke
marijuana just in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we all took the pledge to never again
vote for a candidate unless they were
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to support our freedom,
we'll end marijuana prohibition in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of election cycles.
