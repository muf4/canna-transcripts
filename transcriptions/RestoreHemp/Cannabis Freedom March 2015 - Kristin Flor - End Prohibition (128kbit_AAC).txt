[SPEAKER_00]: We are a group that believes that nobody
should go to prison or die for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you guys met me was about
three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to you guys in a lot of pain over
my father that the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now three years later, I'm fighting for
all the prisoners and the defendants that
[SPEAKER_00]: he left behind, and I'm not gonna give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that this whole march is based
around freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that because we all have
freedom right now, and some of us don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize how sacred that freedom is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've just implemented a lot of
laws that can take away all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if we look on who's stage with
me, we got Martin Nickerson here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his two co-defendants,
they're facing 30 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and we also got behind us,
we got Michelle and Roland Greg,
[SPEAKER_00]: who just because of jury nullification,
that's your power to say not guilty if you
[SPEAKER_00]: think the laws are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, they're almost to a point
where maybe they don't have to go to jail
[SPEAKER_00]: for a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some things that just not all
of us can do, but everybody in our
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, you can go to court support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do outreach for our prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though we're here right now,
there's about 50 people that will never
[SPEAKER_00]: get to be here because they've been sent
to life in prison for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we've got all these laws
that are in place right now that says that
[SPEAKER_00]: if we violate them, if we share medical
medicine, if we do things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed one thing here today that is
not here over the last couple years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's all these police out here
trying to catch us doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we know that nobody should go to
jail for a plant, and we stand up and we
[SPEAKER_00]: get in trouble because I know some of our
caregivers are not going to stop curing
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, they're not going to stop
medicating, they're not going to stop some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, and some of us might break the
laws out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we know that nobody should go to
jail for a plant, we stand up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: courtrooms and we educate each other about
our right to stay not guilty, we can fight
[SPEAKER_00]: these laws that could possibly turn us
into prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soon the Human Solution, and we're
asking a lot of groups out there to join
[SPEAKER_00]: us, are going to ask for some letters for
the Kettle Falls Five and for Martin
[SPEAKER_00]: Nickerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have Debbie and Josh out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys know them,
but they are caregivers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not here today, but they just
got federally indicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we have these state laws,
we still have federal laws that says it's
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all need to band together and get
united.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to urge everybody to go to
our website at www.thsintl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now the Human Solution has just
implemented a lot of structure and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a media team, we have our national
media coordinator here, we have one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: members, Tony, here, and we got a whole
bunch of members across the whole nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to international, we just started a
chapter in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even in Kenya nobody deserves to
go to jail or die for a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys please check out our website
and talk to these defendants and know that
[SPEAKER_00]: their sacrifices that they've made are for
all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat them like the heroes that they
are and check them out.
