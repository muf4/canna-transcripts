[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Jennifer Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me Stony Girl, and I want you
all to know that I ran for county
[SPEAKER_00]: commissioner two years ago, and I had an
amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent 50 bucks so that I could run
against my county commissioners because
[SPEAKER_00]: they tried to ban cannabis in Clackamas
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I made them talk about cannabis at
every single candidate forum, every single
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate event, and at the end,
I won 10% of the vote, which was more than
[SPEAKER_00]: two of the other candidates up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only spent 350 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid 50 bucks for my filing fee and $300
for my candidate statement, and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of them spent a quarter of a
million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I can do that, you can do it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important thing is all of our
legislatures need to hear from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be running at every level,
state representative, senator,
[SPEAKER_00]: city council, county commissioner,
because it's an opportunity for us to make
[SPEAKER_00]: our voice heard in places where our story
would never be told anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet people at the old folks'
home and tell them about how cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_00]: cared my stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to put it in my voters' pamphlet and
send the message out to every voter in my
[SPEAKER_00]: county, and I would like everyone to
consider running for office at least once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even worry about whether you win or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that running to argue is so much
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make it possible for marijuana
to be legal everywhere else.
Thank you.
