[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of another fellow I was
talking about running for governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, I'll be for you or against
you, whichever helped you the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any government that tells you that the
solution to a present-day problem is
[SPEAKER_01]: doubling the prison population over the
next 20 years has its head stuck where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's never going to discover the thousand
points of light of George Bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people's idea of future full
employment is to make half of us prison
[SPEAKER_01]: guards and the other half prisoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: This man is an alien.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not a conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an alien.
[SPEAKER_01]: He and Ronald Reagan both.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are willing to imprison a whole
generation of people to keep intact the
[SPEAKER_01]: petrochemical and pharmaceutical
monopolies in this country, which he's
[SPEAKER_01]: well-vested in each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he's a vampire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he's an American.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's a vampire willing to suck the
life out of all us victims in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: remain powerful and in a powerful
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me take this opportunity right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever this gets shown limitation,
I am pleased and honored to be in presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of one of the most brilliant men in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gentleman next to you, I recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: The author of Emperor Wears No Clothes and
so much more than just an author,
[SPEAKER_01]: a researcher and a dedicated and diligent
activist and a man who I know for a fact
[SPEAKER_01]: is responsible for tens of thousands of
people in this country being able to come
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the closet and stand up out of
darkness and stand up out of oppression
[SPEAKER_01]: and despair and lives of quiet
desperation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be able to point to the source of
knowledge and the truth and the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: light that this man right here is
personally responsible for putting
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be where I am today were it
not for Jack Hare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that a lot of people would not
be walking tall with dignity and a sense
[SPEAKER_01]: of pride and a sense that they do no wrong
by communicating with Mother Earth through
[SPEAKER_01]: the Earth and in other fashions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this man right here is responsible for
as much of it as I know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure other people deserve credit who
have helped him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this man right here is one of the most
brilliant people in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope someday that this country and
the people in it will reward him
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriately for what he's done for
freedom and individuality and civil
[SPEAKER_01]: liberties and Mother Earth in this
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take that opportunity right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean I've got free grass for the
rest of my life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you something you can take
back and give you better photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mr. Henry Ford in 1941 with
Popular Mechanics magazine showing off his
[SPEAKER_00]: car made from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that when the whole car itself was
made from hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says so right there in Popular
Mechanics, 1941.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: One more deal in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an eerie addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have never let us find that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, that is, that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you right now, this is not the
case of a blind hog snubbing out an acorn
[SPEAKER_01]: every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dedication and intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think Edison said that genius
is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: This man right here is sweating his ass
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes, he certainly has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, I have a lot of good
features.
[SPEAKER_00]: This man wrote a book that I read that was
one of the, really, him, Michael Aldridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: had written some of the greatest work on
hemp long before I even really understood
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote it in 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kentucky, what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana peaceability study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was by adding that and that and the
prospectus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is not somebody who needs to come to
me and learn about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot about hemp from him.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in it, Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
