[SPEAKER_00]: start drafting this thing start drafting
it way back in 1988 so I didn't dream back
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'd still be working on it all these
years later but we finally put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot and it is a transformative proposal
it would make hemp and marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: completely legal you'd be able to grow
your own without a permit license or
[SPEAKER_00]: registration you'd be able to sell seeds
and starts of all varieties of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: without permit license or registration you
want to sell the flowers you'd have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a license and you'd have to process it so
there'd be a process around selling the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers but you know I really believe that
the only reason marijuana is illegal is
[SPEAKER_00]: because of hemp fuel and hemp fiber the
word marijuana was based as we know on on
[SPEAKER_00]: racist propaganda from the petrochemical
industry they realized that with new
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that made hemp cultivation a
lot cheaper that the price of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: products were going to fall dramatically
just as with the invention of the cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: gin the price of cotton had fallen to a
penny on the dollar the price of hemp was
[SPEAKER_00]: set to do that with the invention of new
decorticating machinery so they came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a new name for hemp everybody knew
what hemp was they came up with a new name
[SPEAKER_00]: and they got it from Mexico from a
revolutionary war song Pacho Vila led the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican Revolution in 1911 and they had a
song called la cucaracha you guys might
[SPEAKER_00]: have heard it when I was a kid I remember
Bugs Bunny used to sing it la cucaracha la
[SPEAKER_00]: cucaracha anyway in that song I won't
torture you anymore with my singing but in
[SPEAKER_00]: that song they said the cockroach smoked
marijuana well when the Mexican Revolution
[SPEAKER_00]: happened they nationalized the oil
industry and the Mexican petroleum
[SPEAKER_00]: production is still nationalized and run
by the government well the oil barons in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania and Texas did not like that
so they took this word from this Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolutionary War song and they created a
whole misinformation propaganda campaign
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and said that there's this deadly
new drug called marijuana because people
[SPEAKER_00]: go crazy and kill their families and
friends so based on that baloney they were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to prohibit hemp but hemp is tied to
our civilization fact if you go back over
[SPEAKER_00]: 12,000 years ago all the new agricultural
civilizations in Asia were growing hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp was originally from high up in the
Himalaya Mountains in present-day Tibet
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepal Kashmir Afghanistan and by at least
12,000 years ago and perhaps over 30,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago people learned to cultivate it
and they spread down and form
[SPEAKER_00]: civilizations all across Asia and once we
know about today we call Mesopotamia along
[SPEAKER_00]: the Tigris and Euphrates River Valley in
present-day Iraq our prehistoric China
[SPEAKER_00]: along the Yellow River the Huanghe in
China and in those communities they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing hemp that it's a common crop it's
the oldest crop known to man and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: it produces more fuel more fiber more food
and more medicine than any other plant on
[SPEAKER_00]: this planet and the petrochemical people
realized that that it was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: displace with new technology it's going to
displace a lot of their economic fight but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know petroleum is what economists call
capital intensive takes a lot of money or
[SPEAKER_00]: capital and they take tens of millions
hundreds of millions of dollars some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: billion dollars to go out and drill for
petroleum and it takes tens of billions
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred billion dollars to refine
petroleum into all the different products
[SPEAKER_00]: we make it if you can grow very
inexpensively and you get a cheap oil
[SPEAKER_00]: press and get at least 300 gallons of oil
per acre and the byproduct of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: three tons or six thousand pounds of high
protein hemp seed meal so hemp prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: is really about fuel and fiber and the
continued centralization of economic and
[SPEAKER_00]: political control it's about this plant
that makes more fuel fiber food and
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine than any other plant and so our
initiative would completely restore that
[SPEAKER_00]: if cultivation will not be limited to low
THC strains low THC yeah it's bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no reason to grow low THC hemp it
produces half as much fiber and 1 20th as
[SPEAKER_00]: much seed oil and protein what they've
done with low THC hemp is they've bred out
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers by breeding out the flowers
they bred out the seeds and the seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: where the oils at and that's what they
don't want us to have because you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: hip seed oil or a lot of other vegetable
oil and pour it right into any diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: engine and turn the key and drive it now
hip is three times more productive than
[SPEAKER_00]: the next most productive seed oil crop
those are canola or rapeseed soybeans and
[SPEAKER_00]: sunflower seeds each of those make about a
hundred to 120 gallons of oil per acre
[SPEAKER_00]: where hemp makes at least 300 gallons of
oil per acre given the economics of
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiesel today we should see hip
biodiesel for less than a buck a gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: and the petrochemical companies don't want
to compete with that so our initiative
[SPEAKER_00]: frees that and it's ballot measure 80 you
know it's on the ballot this November the
[SPEAKER_00]: best thing you could possibly do is
register and vote you haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: registered in the past you haven't
registered because you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in the political process you
didn't think there was anything worth
[SPEAKER_00]: voting for well this year there is
something worth voting for there's ballot
[SPEAKER_00]: measure 80 and you can vote to end
marijuana prohibition and let our brother
[SPEAKER_00]: sisters out of jail and restore hemp for
fuel fiber food and medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: completely transform our economy you know
they say the energy industry is the
[SPEAKER_00]: world's largest industry and it the money
that comes from that goes into the pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: of these saudi arabian sheiks nigerian
despots exxon mobile shell british
[SPEAKER_00]: petroleum and they put it into their swiss
bank accounts when our farmers can get
[SPEAKER_00]: that energy money for hip biodiesel fuel
that money will go into our local
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and revitalize our towns and
reorient our entire economy that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about it's really it's really a
conspiracy from the petrochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical military industrial
transnational corporate elite fascist sons
[SPEAKER_00]: of bitches you know my father was in world
war two he was on a pt boat out the
[SPEAKER_00]: pacific fighting the fascists we defeated
the nazis in germany and drove the
[SPEAKER_00]: fascists out of power and unfortunately
our government has it all too often
[SPEAKER_00]: emulated those fascist policies you know
my father did not fight the fascists so we
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to pee in a cup for employment
we need to end the crazy war on drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: restore him for fuel and fiber so register
vote and help us pass measure 80 this
[SPEAKER_00]: november and change the world for the
better thanks
