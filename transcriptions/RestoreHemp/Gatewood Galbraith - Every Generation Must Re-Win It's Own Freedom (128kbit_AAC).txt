[SPEAKER_00]: What groups or organizations or
individuals have inspired you in your
[SPEAKER_00]: life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, listen, if it wasn't for an
extremely good mama and the credit of
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddyville Maximum Security Prison,
I'd gone wrong a really long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my mama would probably get me on
straight and narrow more than anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I got older, I became desperate for
a role model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked for the people who I
thought stood for the right things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided, quite frankly, if you want
to know the truth, I decided to just
[SPEAKER_00]: decide that he's the new hero and there's
no reason in the world why it shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every generation must win its own freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our past generation had such icons as
faulty as they were as John Lane and Clint
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastwood as being a sovereign individual,
a human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this younger generation doesn't have
any heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Ben Diesel is not the hero that
reached the audience as a character for
[SPEAKER_00]: our people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these kill-em-all kinds of kung fu
masters, you know, they aren't the hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heroes are people like Gary Cooper in
High Noon, like who shot Liberty Valor
[SPEAKER_00]: when somebody who's just trying to do
right has to stand up against some
[SPEAKER_00]: unspeakable villain who grittens the very
freedom and soul of these protagonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess my heroes nowadays are
Lex Colessa and that Chinese gentleman who
[SPEAKER_00]: stood in front of that tank at the
Enderman Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I sneak through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a major problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
