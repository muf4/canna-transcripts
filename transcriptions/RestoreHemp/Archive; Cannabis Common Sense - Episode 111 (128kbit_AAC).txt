[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had hemp fests in the past,
but some of the folks who were organizing
[SPEAKER_02]: it just couldn't do it this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the ones up in Seattle have
traditionally been a lot larger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So watch next month, and we'll have some
coverage of that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now's a good time to go down to
the Saturday market.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just want to sign the petition,
don't want us to send it to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you can do is you can come down to
our booth down at Portland Saturday
[SPEAKER_02]: Market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also petitioners at the Eugene
Saturday Market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you can sign the petition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have a little interview with the
other chief petitioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul and I are both chief petitioners on
the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act, but our other
[SPEAKER_02]: chief petitioner is Dr. Philip Levesque,
a retired professor of pharmacology and
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicology that taught up here at the
current OHSU, also taught at Georgetown
[SPEAKER_02]: University and a number of other
universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without any further ado, here's an
interview with Dr. Levesque down at our
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland Saturday Market booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome to come down and sign our
petition, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we have one of our chief
petitioners at our booth, Dr. Philip
[SPEAKER_02]: Levesque.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Levesque is a retired professor of
pharmacology and a lobbyist for AARP,
[SPEAKER_02]: the American Association of Retired
Persons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Dr. Levesque.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us why you decided to be a chief
petitioner to regulate the sale of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana to adults and allow doctors to
prescribe it through different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you tell us what your credentials
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a PhD in pharmacology and I'm an
osteopathic doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught pharmacology and toxicology for
approximately 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we really thank you again for being
a chief petitioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need people with your types of
credentials to sign on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you'd like to tell our
television audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign this petition and get this back on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two votes to make marijuana
available for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time that the hypocrisy quit and we
make it available not only for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, but also for recreational
purposes, which it is being used for right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a person who uses for recreational
purposes and is caught by the police can
[SPEAKER_00]: lose his home.
[SPEAKER_00]: His car, his bank accounts, any of his
assets that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there we were down at the Saturday
Market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we invite you come on down to
the Saturday Market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also invite you to just call us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to head down to the
Saturday Market, we'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us at 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're outside of the Portland area,
that's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have positions available for paid
petitioners in both Oregon and Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have our regular volunteer campaign
that we'd love for you to be involved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you saw a little bit of Saturday
Market there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially if you can come down
and you want to sign it and you don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody else who will sign it with you,
instead of us mailing you on and costing
[SPEAKER_01]: us a post stamp and then you a post stamp
mail in the back, come on down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the fun of Saturday Market and meet
some fellow activists and sign a petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows, you know, maybe Dr. Laveck
will be there because he's a real colorful
[SPEAKER_01]: character, really knowledgeable in his
field of pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And toxicology talks over my head
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can meet some dedicated volunteers
who've been on the street, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking with people all the time,
like Floyd Landriff, who's down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was almost every Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sees the direct impact that our
prohibition has on your fellow citizens,
[SPEAKER_01]: on your neighbors, because he's out there
helping folks who are trapped in that
[SPEAKER_01]: vicious cycle of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he does needle exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the folks who are addicted to hard
drugs go to Floyd five days a week and
[SPEAKER_02]: they exchange needles, which keeps the
neighborhoods clean, at least around
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't find used needles laying around
in the gutter because the folks can go
[SPEAKER_02]: trade them in for new ones for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really valuable public service.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gives out free food to folks,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it provides a little community
for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's a story out of a German
language paper out of Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the Luxembourg policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They announce a new drug policy for
Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_02]: These changes were agreed upon by the main
political parties there, the Christian
[SPEAKER_02]: Democrats and the liberal Democrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's their intention to enshrine a
newly defined health-based drug policy
[SPEAKER_02]: into law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Current policies won't be changed as much
as extended and strengthened and made
[SPEAKER_02]: official.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says hardcore addicts will be given
heroin and put into the methadone program
[SPEAKER_02]: and that penalties for consumption of soft
drugs, another word for marijuana and
[SPEAKER_02]: hashish, will be reduced to a fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Judges will be empowered to reduce the
penalties if accompanied by therapy
[SPEAKER_02]: courses, it says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this is translated from German,
so it's a little rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little stilted?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little stilted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luxembourg is keeping its eyes firmly
fixed on, quote, the limits of the
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be no doubt that Prime Minister
Juncker intends to fix the new drug policy
[SPEAKER_02]: in a bill that he hopes to pass in the
next five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're changing their drug policies
and making them more realistic there in
[SPEAKER_02]: Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luxembourg's a tiny country between
Germany and France.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are they basing their policies on
Netherlands experiment there, or?
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Netherlands and Swiss policies,
it does appear that they're trying to base
[SPEAKER_02]: their policies there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, France, like the United States,
is strongly prohibitionist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Germany, it has been pretty
prohibitious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as strong as the French, but it has
been prohibitionist, but it's become much
[SPEAKER_02]: more open in several states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, see, that's the difference,
I think, between France and Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over there, France is a very centralized
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything comes out of Paris.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the localities don't really have
much power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in Germany, they have states like we
have here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, they have quite a bit of power
in individual states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they do in different states,
they have experimented with different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: of dealing with soft drugs, trying to
separate out soft drugs from harder drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so some of them, you know,
have been on borders with the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've seen the impact of the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're trying to fix it in Germany
there, and in some of the former states
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the former East Germany,
because they've had a lot of problems
[SPEAKER_01]: there with unemployment and people turning
into drugs, and people trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: money off of the prohibition policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different ways people
are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of interesting to see
what will come out of over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure it'll give us some lessons
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we try to figure out what's the best
way to go for our drug policy reform,
[SPEAKER_01]: separate out soft drugs from harder drugs,
and to provide treatment for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we want to do,
is to take the market for adult marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: and take it out of the hands of the black
market and put it into the state liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: stores, where it's strictly regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sales are regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the age limit of 21 is enforced,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the black market, you can ask any high
school kid what's easier to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: beer or marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to say every time that
marijuana is much easier to get than beer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just infinitely easier to get than
distilled alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we want to do, is to bring
a realistic policy on marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, here in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the best way to go about it,
we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been looked at as far as
international treaties and how it will fit
[SPEAKER_01]: in with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we talked about that on
numerous shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a faithful watcher,
you probably don't want us to go into it
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to bring change to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do we have any more good news or
bad news articles that we want to share
[SPEAKER_01]: with folks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's one that just highlights the
corruption that drug laws cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the US Army in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, the wife of a senior US Army
colonel who's in charge of the anti-drug
[SPEAKER_02]: efforts led by the US in the country of
Colombia turned herself into authorities
[SPEAKER_02]: on Thursday after being charged with
conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lori Ann Haight, the wife of US Army
colonel James Haight, was serving with an
[SPEAKER_02]: arrest warrant in late June after a
package containing 2.7 pounds of cocaine
[SPEAKER_02]: was mailed from the US military base in
Bogota with her name on the return address
[SPEAKER_02]: label, according to the affidavit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't very bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: A Pentagon official told CNN that Miss
Haight surrendered in New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result of the case, the US military
investigated Colonel Haight and cleared
[SPEAKER_02]: him of any wrongdoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Village Voice, a New York weekly
newspaper, first broke the story about the
[SPEAKER_02]: arrest warrant and CNN later obtained
documents related to the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the affidavit, undercover US
postal inspectors and New York City police
[SPEAKER_02]: officers delivered the package from Miss
Haight wrapped in brown paper about 12 by
[SPEAKER_02]: 4 and 6 inches with an address to a New
York City address and arrested a man who
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to flee the residence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, this man said he'd received
five or six shipments like this and had
[SPEAKER_02]: been paid $1,500 for each of the previous
deliveries.
[SPEAKER_02]: An affidavit says Miss Haight was
interviewed and stated that quote,
[SPEAKER_02]: quote, stated that she had sent six
packages to New York through the mail on
[SPEAKER_02]: behalf of her husband's chauffeur.
[SPEAKER_02]: She claimed that she did not know the
contents of the packages she'd shipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: A spokesman for the US Southern Command
told CNN that the husband was investigated
[SPEAKER_02]: after the incident occurred and has been
cleared of any wrongdoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the Army said Colonel Haight
requested and was granted a transfer from
[SPEAKER_02]: Bogota where he was in charge of the US
military group providing assistance to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian counter narcotics effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I'm sure there that he
requested a transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably gave him five seconds to
request one before they would kick him out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the country there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look very good when the head of
the anti-drug efforts in Colombia,
[SPEAKER_01]: the US head, his wife is involved in
smuggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, either she was knowingly or she's
very, very naive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they always ask you, when you send
anything overseas, you have to put on,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether from the US or to the US,
you have to put on a form what's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's because the customs in each
country, they want to know, and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: the right to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she claims she didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how naive could she be?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just shows the impossible target that
we're shooting at, that the government is
[SPEAKER_02]: financing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, we send these people down there to
wipe out drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether naively or purposely, they're
shipping more cocaine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Colombia, I don't know if folks
have been following the news out of there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's pretty scary what's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US recently lost one of its most
sophisticated spying planes down in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only like seven of these planes
that existed in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one went down there with a bunch of US
people on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now Barry McCaffrey has been doing a
big tour down there, and he's requesting
[SPEAKER_01]: more money be sent down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: An ungodly sum of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's our next war.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's probably our next war.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are already talking about Vietnam
there, because the rebels who are there,
[SPEAKER_01]: opposing the oligarchy that controls the
country, have lined themselves up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: drug growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they control, I think, almost half the
country now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't hear much about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's this rebel force that controls half
of one of our allies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the US doesn't want to see a country
taken over by people that don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with people growing drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be real interesting to see what
comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already, in Afghanistan, where people have
grown up there, we've just lobbed over
[SPEAKER_01]: cruise missiles when we feel like it's
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty scary what they have right
here in their own hemisphere, because we
[SPEAKER_01]: still believe in the Moreau doctrine our
government does, that we want to control
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that happens in this
hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an article from Massachusetts about
forfeiture laws and to see how money
[SPEAKER_02]: corrupts law enforcement agencies,
look at the effects of asset forfeiture
[SPEAKER_02]: laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: A police officer can take all the money
you're carrying and the car you're driving
[SPEAKER_02]: when stopped on the mere suspicion that
you are a drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, never charge you with a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will take you years and thousands
of dollars to recover your property,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's even possible to recover it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your car may have been sold already or
badly damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: In such forfeiture called civil asset
forfeiture, because you were never charged
[SPEAKER_02]: with crime, you must prove in a court of
law that the money and the car are legally
[SPEAKER_02]: yours and were never involved in some
crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you have to prove you are
an innocent party.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, stupid as it sounds, you may have to
prove that your property is innocent too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government doesn't have to prove
you're guilty of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: While it may be easy to prove you are the
legal owner of a car, it's far more
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to prove that the money you're
carrying is money you earn at your job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine how hard it would be to prove your
car or money were never used to facilitate
[SPEAKER_02]: a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: An attorney can cost you thousands of
dollars to sue for recovery of your
[SPEAKER_02]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legal counsel is not provided in such
cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people in simple situations simply
let go and don't try to recover their
[SPEAKER_02]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why spend $6,000 on attorney fees to
recover $5,000?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they count on,
these civil asset forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until these laws were passed in the late
80s under Ronald Reagan, this was never
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was considered unconstitutional for the
government to seize and use your property.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things that needs to be
reformed, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not much that needs to be
said about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think it's unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though maybe have, you know,
those nine people sitting up on a bench in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't quite seen the way that,
I think, the majority of Americans see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at one time, remember,
the Supreme Court said it was okay to lock
[SPEAKER_01]: up Japanese citizens just because they
were of Japanese ancestry and living here
[SPEAKER_01]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we have to help facilitate
that change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be able to work to inform
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're sitting around with your
friends and, you know, maybe some of you
[SPEAKER_01]: folks out there that enjoy adult use of
marijuana and you know who you are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there if you're watching this show,
you know, sign the petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Paula says, register to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your friends registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure they sign the petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're tired of being a criminal,
I'm sure, every time you decide to enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, you know, give us a phone call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sign that petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the number, Paul?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're outside of the Portland area,
that's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can currently print our Oregon
petition out from our website if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: a printer and access the Internet at www
.crh.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can just sign the petition yourself
or get a few friends to sign, call us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to actually get more
involved and be a volunteer on a larger
[SPEAKER_02]: basis, give us a call and mention that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you'd like to be paid for
petitioning, we do have positions
[SPEAKER_02]: available in both Oregon and Washington
where we're currently paying petitioners
[SPEAKER_02]: to put the Cannabis Tax Act on the ballot
in Oregon and on the ballot in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need 90,000 signatures to qualify here
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need about 275,000 signatures to
qualify in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And give us a call so you don't have to be
a criminal anymore or treated like a
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal just because you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's shameful what's going on in this
country right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not here in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way to do it right now is the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for watching, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you next week, same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same station.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good night, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.
Good night.
