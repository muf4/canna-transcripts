[SPEAKER_01]: Initiative Petition 53, which will have a
new ballot measure number come August 2nd,
[SPEAKER_01]: stops treating marijuana use as a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It regulates, legalizes, and taxes
marijuana, similar to how we do beer and
[SPEAKER_01]: wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sets up a wholesaler, retailer,
producer, processor, licenses through the
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon Liquor Control Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be tasked with making sure that
only adults over the age of 21 are
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing cannabis and will be responsible
for collecting the taxes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: generated, which are $35 per ounce for
flour, $10 per ounce of leaf, and $5 for
[SPEAKER_01]: every marijuana plant that's sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40% of the revenue generated will go
towards education.
[SPEAKER_01]: 35% goes to state and local law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% goes to the Oregon Health Authority
for mental health and substance abuse
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment programs, and 5% are allocated
towards drug prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are limited home cultivation
allowed, similar to home brewing and
[SPEAKER_01]: making your own wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's allowed, and it clearly protects
and explicitly protects the Oregon medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana program, so it does not impact
the medical marijuana program at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So patients need higher possession limits,
and the recently licensed and regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities through the Oregon Health
Authority are not impacted by the new
[SPEAKER_01]: approach Oregon measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, the State Department of
Agriculture is currently had a policy of
[SPEAKER_01]: not licensing industrial hemp farmers,
but that's slowly but surely changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new approach measure just mandates
that the State Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot rely upon the federal government to
deny industrial hemp licenses for
[SPEAKER_01]: qualified Oregon farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully it'll help open up a new
market for our farmers who aren't allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to currently possess industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in short, it'll end the arrest or
citation of more than 10,000 Oregonians,
[SPEAKER_01]: better direct the law enforcement
resources, regulate marijuana like beer
[SPEAKER_01]: and wine for adults over the age of 21,
and generate millions of dollars of
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue for our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question we have is,
with this measure, how would taxation
[SPEAKER_00]: work, and is there a difference between
taxing flowers and processed products like
[SPEAKER_00]: hash oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Question of taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So under the new approach Oregon measure,
we tax marijuana one time, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: after the first time it's produced and
sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's taxed at basically $1.25 per gram
of flower, $10 per ounce of leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: and $5 per ounce of large every plant
sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are using the flowers or leaf to
make edibles, oils, hash oil, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: that may be, the marijuana that goes into
the product has already been taxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no additional sales tax,
no additional taxes beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do allow vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be vertically integrated
if you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's one of the things we've
taken like the best from Colorado's
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization measure and the best from
Washington's.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legalization measure to give Oregon
really small businesses the flexibility to
[SPEAKER_01]: shape their business the way they see fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, the marijuana retail stores
have to grow 70% of what they sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Washington, you cannot grow and sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either be a producer or a
retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's led to some of the supply
problems they see in Washington in their
[SPEAKER_01]: rollout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the new approach Oregon measure,
if you're a producer who sells to a
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer, then you'll pay the tax after
you sell to the retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're vertically integrated to where
you're a producer and retailer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not actually taxed until after you
sell it to your customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the marijuana is taxed the same
regardless of what product it went into or
[SPEAKER_01]: what you sell it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
