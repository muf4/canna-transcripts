[SPEAKER_01]: What is the actual state right now,
Dr. Rebecca, of medical marijuana here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's going on right now is that a
person who wants to use medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: in other words, has a disease process,
which includes wasting disease of AIDS,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and some
people even use it for various and sundry
[SPEAKER_00]: types of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is virtually, in particular in
regard to pain, pain is so subjective that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no way for somebody to measure the
degree of pain or the intensity of pain or
[SPEAKER_00]: even the relief of pain or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if a person says, I have a bad back or
I have a bad this or a bad that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm in pain, and that smoking
marijuana helps, I don't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody should deny them the right to use
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's going on in Oregon at the
present time is that people who are using
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for medical purposes have to get
some sort of a letter from a physician
[SPEAKER_00]: which says marijuana will alleviate the
problem, pain, or whatever it might be for
[SPEAKER_00]: this individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This letter is sent to the Oregon Health
Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Grant Higginson is the person who is
the, I guess he's not the director of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Health Division, but he's the
number two person there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one person is not a
physician, but he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is the one to whom these letters are
addressed, and he is the one who will
[SPEAKER_00]: issue the equivalent of a marijuana user's
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the strange thing about it is that it
is still a federal offense to,
[SPEAKER_00]: in many respects, about the use of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the present time, nobody knows
what's going to happen, but this hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: prevented people who get benefit from the
use of marijuana from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are an estimated 100,000 people in
the United States right now who admit to
[SPEAKER_00]: using it for medical purposes,
and there are probably, as I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it, around 10 people, 10 million people,
excuse me, who use marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is, I think the so-called
recreational use of this is kind of a poor
[SPEAKER_00]: term because I don't think people smoke
tobacco for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why people smoke tobacco,
but whether it's for recreational purposes
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it is, this is a sort of a
strange terminology that is used.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when they use alcohol,
that's social drinking or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I suppose that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of the social.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recreational use of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, recreational use of alcohol and the
social use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terminology here is very,
very obscure or muddied or whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: right word is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imprecise, at the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think one of the strangest things
about this is that the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: raises marijuana in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government has it harvested
and processed to make marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes, and there are eight people in
the United States who have letters of
[SPEAKER_00]: permission from the Drug Enforcement
Administration to use marijuana for their
[SPEAKER_00]: medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if eight people can use it for
medical purposes, for relief of their
[SPEAKER_00]: medical problem, why can't nine or 10 or
1,000 use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very strange situation,
and a year and a half ago, I was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: six doctors who testified at the American
Medical Association convention for the
[SPEAKER_00]: American Medical Association to stand
behind the rights of patients to use
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for medical purposes,
and this was passed by the House of
[SPEAKER_00]: Delegates of the American Medical
Association in Dallas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headquarters of the American Medical
Association has, I don't know whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: word is they've sat on their hands or sat
on their heads or whatever they've done,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they haven't done anything about it,
and we six doctors have written a letter
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Journal of the American Medical
Association as the equivalent of a letter
[SPEAKER_00]: to the editor asking, why hasn't the
American Medical Association taken a stand
[SPEAKER_00]: on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first letter we wrote,
they sent back that we're sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're rejecting it because we have too
many other things to print in the magazine
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that, and then about six
weeks ago, the American, what is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Institute of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Institute of Medicine.
The National Academy of Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Institute of Medicine from the
National Academy of Science came out very
[SPEAKER_00]: highly publicized throughout the United
States that there was considerable
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that marijuana was good for
certain medical problems, and the American
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical Association has been strangely
quiet about this, but in view of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute of Medicine, we six doctors
again wrote a letter to the American
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical Association and the Journal of the
American Medical Association to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Institute of Medicine says that it has
some benefit in medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and why should people who use it be thrown
in jail for using it for medical reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as somebody pointed out a few minutes
ago, we are at the cutting edge of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the vote, I guess the last two
elections we had for medical, for use of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, November of 98 here in Oregon and
Washington and Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona, they voted on it for the second
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They originally voted in 1996,
along with California to legalize medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, if I understand right,
there are six states who have passed
[SPEAKER_00]: initiatives, is that what it is,
or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, six, and then that's not counting the
District of Columbia where the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States Federal Congress has not allowed
that vote to be counted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exit polls show that it passed with 72%,
but an amendment to an appropriations
[SPEAKER_02]: rider by Georgia Representative Bob Barr
defunded the counting of that vote and
[SPEAKER_02]: said that the District of Columbia cannot
count the vote on medical marijuana that
[SPEAKER_02]: was on their ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so Dr. Beck, I mean, Florida State,
is there every day, you know, we find new
[SPEAKER_01]: information about drugs that have existed
for a long time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like the book is closed,
you know, once they come out with a drug
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's very interesting that
we know from historical records that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has been used for literally
thousands of years, and nobody has ever
[SPEAKER_00]: reported any bad effects from the use of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you compare that to tobacco or to
alcohol, there's absolutely no comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: between tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just absolutely none whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the statement that marijuana is a
gateway drug to heroin or cocaine or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, this was virtually verbally
thrashed by the Institute of Medicine that
[SPEAKER_00]: said there was no evidence whatsoever that
this was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the main thing that we're doing
is supporting General McCafferty and a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of DEA agents who are making
very high salaries and don't want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: up the game, as you might say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people that are making money on the
marijuana issue are the DEA agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people who grow and sell marijuana
and don't pay any taxes on any aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: the money that they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're caught, they get sent to a
federal prison where it costs at least
[SPEAKER_00]: $40,000 a year to keep them in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the federal prisons,
the guards in the prisons are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: also recipients of a lot of money from the
marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a strange, absolutely
bizarre situation that this has gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't understand why some of these
politicians in Washington DC and elsewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: can't see this or understand it or
whatever the right word is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand it.
