[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we have a box of frosted
flakes with Michael Phelps, the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: fastest swimmer who says on the back,
Michael rules with eight for eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously marijuana didn't slow him
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that he came out and won
another meet here a couple of weeks ago
[SPEAKER_00]: and didn't test positive for marijuana and
the urine tests associated with there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you must know that he has to wait a
month or so after he's smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it obviously didn't slow him down and
he seems to be breathing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like he grew gills.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now right next to it we have a cannabis
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Eli Lilly, another drug
company that's still in existence today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extract number 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eli Lilly had about 15 different cannabis
preparations and this is just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next door we have Upjohn cannabis
extract, a cannabis tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these were liquid extracts of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this one is from Merrill drug company,
which is merged with another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a powdered extract of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was powdered hash or keef and this
bottle held an ounce, one ounce it says
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the back, one ounce of powdered
extract of cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's really old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's circa 1870.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got what they call label under glass
or lug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lug stands for label under glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to put the label on then put the
glass on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a cannabis extract circa
1870.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next door we have a rare combination
of an unopened cannabis container from
[SPEAKER_00]: specific medicines and an empty bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know there inside this there is a
full bottle and it's a Lloyd Brothers
[SPEAKER_00]: extract of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty nifty having a completely
unopened and still sealed one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right next door we have a larger dug
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are dug out of the ground and this
one has it embossed right on the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: of the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Dr. H.
[SPEAKER_00]: James cannabis indica extract from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's embossed right on the surface of
the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says right here on this second line
cannabis indica, cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you which HDTV you get to benefit
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right next door Linden's Balsam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of different Balsam
medicines for coughs and colds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has many languages on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from Norwegian and Finnish to
Spanish and Portuguese and Hungarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insert comes with 11 different things
and there's a full unopened bottle of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cough medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to it is Dr. Bliss' Bliss
Native Balsam for coughs and colds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains one half of a gram of cannabis
indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: To each ounce along with other valuable
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next we have a colic remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colic for spasmatic and flatulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colic it says on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you want to be around
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from Costco drugs of Lincoln,
Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's glycerphosphates with cannabis and
lecithin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like it was pretty good I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys were way ahead of their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the one that is always,
right up here at the top is a little label
[SPEAKER_00]: that says chocolate coated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate coated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, how many?
[SPEAKER_00]: This held 500 compressed tablets of
cannabis indica and opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate coated cannabis indica and opium
pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that just knocked you
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That beats M&M's any day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if it melted in your mouth or in
your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next we have a modern product
from Manitoba Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hulled hemp seeds or hemp seed nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelled hemp seeds taste a lot like
walnuts and kind of a cross between
[SPEAKER_00]: walnuts and cashews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very healthy product that has
all your essential fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Omega 3, 6, and 9 in a perfect balance for
human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will keep you alive when you can't
eat anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bag of that will keep you alive with
complete protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
