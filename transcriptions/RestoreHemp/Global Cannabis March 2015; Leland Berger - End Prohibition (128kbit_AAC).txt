[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people might say, well, why are we
still marching?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still marching because there are
people who are in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still marching because people can't
get their records expunged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God Representative Lou Frederick
feels that, filed a bill, has been pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we may get some of the
expungement stuff in the 91 bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's left is, oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot one other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what today is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is the first day in Oregon where if
there is a moratorium preventing safe
[SPEAKER_00]: access to the distribution of medical
cannabis at a licensed medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, it's not us that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the city that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is so over.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 884, with the 16 amendments,
I mean, we'll see what happens Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you might do is you might call
people on the 91 committee, encourage them
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure they don't adopt the
amendments that change section 30 and 31.
[SPEAKER_00]: Section 30 and 31 make it so there can
only be reasonable regulations and no
[SPEAKER_00]: moratoriums and makes crystal clear that
state law prevails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Floyd Prisansky, Senator
Prisansky, in presenting to the committee
[SPEAKER_00]: on this was asked by Andy Olson,
a representative from Albany, a former
[SPEAKER_00]: state trooper, a guy who gets it generally
about medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, you know, does it really
need to be an absolute thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have to be the same thing
everywhere that we have to have it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can't ban it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Floyd looked at him and said,
yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy said, well, if you want to,
you know, it's not medicine federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Floyd said, people say it's medicine
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medicine in science, law,
and fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to have its
distribution interfered with where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed and regulated anywhere in the
state anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's over, starting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you what's not over.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not over is the bigotry that caused
them to deny patients safe access.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some places, there are some
people, they just don't like our kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they do is they wrap themselves
in the flag and say, well, the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government says it's a schedule
uncontrolled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, federal law, we're going to require
that for you to get a business license,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be in compliance with federal
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in compliance with federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not giving bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Oregon law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oregonians have the power and the
right to make it so that marijuana is not
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the federal government wants
it to be illegal doesn't mean they can
[SPEAKER_00]: require the states to make it illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thing called commandeering in the
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressly not allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's how alcohol prohibition,
alcohol prohibition ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol prohibition ended when the state
said we're not going to enforce federal
[SPEAKER_00]: law anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point in New York City,
there were more speakeasies than there
[SPEAKER_00]: were churches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens when prohibition ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't, you know, often when I'm
called upon to speak publicly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reminded of those of us who aren't
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking about and wishing that
they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about Jack Herr and Jim Clark
and Jim Gregg and Sister Sativa Melody
[SPEAKER_00]: Silverwolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure miss all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their work and our work is not over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be active.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to come together on this day
and march.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless you all.
