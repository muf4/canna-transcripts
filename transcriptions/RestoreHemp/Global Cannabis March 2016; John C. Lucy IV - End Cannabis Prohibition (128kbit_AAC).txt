[SPEAKER_00]: If you can hear me, I want to hear you say
420 back to me so I know you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: listening, because this is important,
because this will keep you out of prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I hear a 420?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I am John C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucy IV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own Law 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I've been a marijuana activist
before I could even join Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined Normal and told them that I was
18 when I was 16, because my friends were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends were being put in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were being put in cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were being put in cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of my friends died in those
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here knows somebody who's been
arrested for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here knows somebody who went to
jail for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here knows somebody,
if you know me, you know somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows people who died for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're here to do is stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Oregon, we have legal medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have legal recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in a place where you grow
tobacco, corn liquor's still legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can buy things that'll kill you at
just about every drug store and just about
[SPEAKER_00]: every corner store, but you can't buy
marijuana there, which won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana isn't going to kill anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that you die from marijuana
is if the government puts you in a cage
[SPEAKER_00]: and you die there, or if 100 pounds of it
falls off a truck and smashes you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it's not going to kill
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I want everyone here to
understand there are still ways that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can be hurt by prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not exempt from being ticketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not exempt from being put in a
cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not exempt from any of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police officers can still arrest you for
certain quantities of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can still arrest you for leaving the
state with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can still arrest you for being at the
post office with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody came to me and they said,
hey, I need to go drop this package off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, do you have marijuana in
your car?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you're about to go on federal
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's a very good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get caught in the half plus of Oregon
that's federal land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get caught on tribal land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get caught on any place where
marijuana hasn't been made legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can still put you in a cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can still find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can still take away your kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can still make your life a living
hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm here to say we're going to stop
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will not happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana will be legal in our lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the entire country.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to happen because I'm going
to do it, and you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who comes to you and says
marijuana shouldn't be legal, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to come out of the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to say marijuana should be
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is something I either do or have
done, or I know someone who's close to me
[SPEAKER_00]: who's done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can do that, it ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of us have to be in cages
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us have to pretend we don't do it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana doesn't lead to harder things.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least for me, marijuana led to the
hardest thing I did was grad school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I have a doctorate because of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana helped me go from a person who
couldn't go to class because I was so
[SPEAKER_00]: sick, I couldn't stand up vomiting in a
toilet, to a person who runs a business,
[SPEAKER_00]: pays my taxes, does what I'm supposed to
do as an American citizen, takes care of
[SPEAKER_00]: my family, takes care of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to do that, support
marijuana legalization not only here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, support marijuana legalization
everywhere in this country, and support
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legalization everywhere on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
