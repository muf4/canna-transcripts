[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our 50th show so it's a real
milestone isn't it Paul?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it's definitely a milestone and I'd
like to thank everybody that's volunteered
[SPEAKER_02]: down here to help us put this show on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah we'd like to thank Lanny for making
his club The Rage in downtown Portland
[SPEAKER_01]: available to us and Gregory and everyone
involved so thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Paul Stanford and I'm one of
the chief petitioners along with our
[SPEAKER_01]: associate Paul Loney here on the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act and that is a petition
[SPEAKER_01]: put out by the campaign for the
restoration and regulation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, our political action committee
says it all, the campaign for the
[SPEAKER_02]: restoration and regulation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a comprehensive initiative which
would regulate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would allow sales to adults through
state liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would allow patients to access medical
marijuana at pharmacies at cost with a
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription from a doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would allow our farmers to grow
industrial hemp which is the low THC
[SPEAKER_02]: variety and it would provide for some
education and real drug education
[SPEAKER_02]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, it would create thousands of jobs
in industrial hemp and it would also bring
[SPEAKER_01]: in hundreds of millions of dollars in
state revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know we're circulating it as a
petition right now and we need your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are at about 24,000 signatures as we're
taping in early April.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need 73,000 good valid signatures by
the end of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've sent out thousands of these to our
viewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have our petition already we urge
you to mail it back to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have it yet let us mail it to
you right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the petitions back to us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you only have one or two or three
signatures on it, make sure you get your
[SPEAKER_02]: signature and at least your best friend's
signature on that and get them back to us
[SPEAKER_02]: or call us up and get more signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today in today's show we're going to go
back up to Vancouver, B.C., the marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: breadbasket of the Pacific Northwest as
it's now known and continue to view our
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews up there in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're interviewing, it's the second
half of our interview with Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Emery is a long time activist who's
been practicing civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_01]: He founded a multi-million dollar
business, Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Cannabis Cafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a Hemp B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: legal assistance center and a wholesale
business and a magazine called Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada that's just spectacular,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a fabulous magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the most comprehensive
magazine on cannabis in the entire world
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's done very nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice layout, very nice graphics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Photographers are all great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people we met up there were all great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally they have something that I
personally really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always have some hemp paper in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's printed on the fibers,
paper made from the fibers of the
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they're putting their money where
their mouth is and so I think it's time to
[SPEAKER_02]: get to the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get into the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last plug, call us at 235-4606 to get
this petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Emery's interview, he starts out
talking about some of his legal problems
[SPEAKER_01]: since he's come out in the media with the
Wall Street Journal and CNN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts out with that and goes into
politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go to jail indefinitely until
it comes up in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got ways of breaking,
if they want to break you, they can break
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've raided me twice and they've
certainly racked up a pile of debts and
[SPEAKER_00]: caused my assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that restaurant cost me a quarter
million dollars alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably one of the most famous
restaurants in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sold it for about 50,000 bucks over
five years because nobody will buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant that doesn't have a business
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's under constant police supervision for
no particular reason, mind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't liquidate a commodity like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, I was given about
10 days to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like classic Jewish pogrom in
Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got three days to get out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sell all your stuff for whatever
you can get, which will be like one tenth
[SPEAKER_00]: of its value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to liquidate and you're just
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't liquidate, they just come
back and seize it anyway, like they've
[SPEAKER_00]: already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't need any special permission to
raid me twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they clearly told me we don't need it
to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took the hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they came back and said, listen,
we're not even going to wait until you go
[SPEAKER_00]: to court to contest the license
suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just come and take all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, well, see, if you sell the
business and a new license application,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to be given up to a year to two
years to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they don't break the law,
or they don't appear to be advocating
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking the law, like I do, then they
can't be denied a business license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are protected in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a guy who's gone on every major
media and said, I break the law every day
[SPEAKER_00]: seven different ways this Sunday,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already cashed in my ability to go to
before a judge and say, I'm a good
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obey laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't obey laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real clear that I don't obey them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 16 counts against me of various
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are really outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all related to this marijuana
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all idiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never sold marijuana, never even been
accused of selling marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven of them relate to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them relate to giving somebody a
gift of $5 worth of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all life sentence convictions,
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been taken to jail twice for just
giving out brochures on government
[SPEAKER_00]: property legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They handcuffed me and jailed me twice for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm charged with assaulting a police
officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it is, I spit on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they raided us last time,
they started beating up my employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there watching it happen right
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told me to back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spit in the cop's face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stopped beating on them,
and they beat on me, and threw me in jail
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the intention of spitting on
the cop anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's a pretty reasonable form
of contempt, a spit on a cop in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: my employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, also, what am I supposed to do in
front of my employees anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, was it to stand there and let the
cop do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I chose the most suitable line
of resistance that was the least
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there others?
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, I've got one charge of promoting
paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one charge of selling
paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've kind of got it all covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight and nine trafficking, two
paraphernalia, one literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: two assaulting the cop, the usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So including literature, you said?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got you for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not promoting literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving out brochures at the
community center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had to get permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my understanding was you don't need to
get permission to give out brochures on
[SPEAKER_00]: government property related to a national
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a petition to Parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they busted you for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I refused to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just said, well, we're just
going to have to handcuff you and take you
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, handcuff me and take me
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you out at City Hall?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I was at the West End Community
Center, which is right beside the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: So democracy is not necessarily alive and
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that it's any good if it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's a very peculiar place in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's interesting right now that to
us down in the States, especially in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific Northwest part of the United
States, Vancouver is sort of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: shining beacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is in a relative way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you created it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because basically, it's a police state
unless you fight back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, you might find
that they give in and they relent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, everything we do is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't bother us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never bothered us until American
government pressure was put on our police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably never bothered me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm a good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You check all my interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You check the CNN show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say nice things about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You check the article that's in Rolling
Stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops say nice things about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always say nice things about me
because there's nothing bad to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a totally upfront, honest guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay all the money that everybody is
entitled to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give tons to all the governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was great to my employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I improved that neighborhood vastly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've contributed probably to $2 billion in
economic growth in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because marijuana has really gone through
the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become easily the major crop in this
province.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they got a great promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a great spokesman in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think of great pot,
everybody thinks BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a lot of bogus pot
trading throughout North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying it's BC pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's BC pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because that's the reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say that about a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to be interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of what's in Portland is from
BC, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same with Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly California and a bit of
Colorado, Idaho, and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me a low figure to say it's $4
billion in production every year out of
[SPEAKER_00]: British Columbia alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly I take a lot of credit for
that because we have made British Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: pot famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all good, so it's easy to
promote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there was nobody
before I existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing absolutely existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't 40, 50 hemp stores,
as you see now, or hemp symposiums being
[SPEAKER_00]: held down the street at the Pan Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's none of that going on before we
came by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's hundreds of hemp stores
and a couple magazines and just lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: activity in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we subsidized everything in the period
when it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave easily last year $100,000 in money
and free legal help to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the police knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they attacked us, because they
wanted to damage us financially,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that money was subsidizing the
whole war against the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sold $3.5 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recirculated all of it, but the
$80,000 I keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of money to turn back into
our information campaign, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a lot of interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've been in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My three proudest ones are the worldwide
CNN broadcast, which has been aired three
[SPEAKER_00]: times now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Impact Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Impact Show, yeah, which was fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on our website, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Wall Street Journal front page on
December 5, 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had five editors go through every
aspect of my life you could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they said they were not going to
put a drug dealer with any negative
[SPEAKER_00]: connections on the front page if there was
anything that came up, like any single
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they couldn't find anybody to say
anything about it, maybe from a cop,
[SPEAKER_00]: to my old teachers, to any employees,
to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could not find a negative comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to my neighbors, couldn't find
anybody there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they put me on the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing on the front page is my
face there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Rolling Stone article,
which is really nice, because it goes to a
[SPEAKER_00]: different market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all different markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: CNN, Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now that I've been kicked out and
forced into some degree of retirement,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel at least we've accomplished a lot
in that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly set the ball for a lot of
people to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what businesses do you still have now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have Cannabis Canada,
where we're filming right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still do mail order to Cannabis
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still sell bongs and pipes and
magazines and books and seeds by mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the retail outlets were the real cash
cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to sell $5,000, $6,000 worth of
seeds a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And $4,000 a day in the Hemp BC store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cafe never does too much,
like $1,000 a day there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they've got to pay for their
people, because this place is now still
[SPEAKER_00]: having about 22 employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their money gets turned back into the
suppliers and the employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We protected as many jobs as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have about 31 people in the Hemp
BC family, whereas we had 43 at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: January.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to let go anybody who really
couldn't be justified financially anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legal services aren't free anymore
now, because we lost most of our sources
[SPEAKER_00]: of revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the freebies had to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sponsored Cannabis Nation Radio
Hour, which is the weekly radio show for
[SPEAKER_00]: our Coastal Cross Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We paid for that entirely, paid for
everybody's legal services at the law
[SPEAKER_00]: office.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were never charged for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was easily $100,000 a year for that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We subsized tons of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Hemp stores in Canada have received
money from us, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we can't do anymore now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the intent of this whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were saying, why are you letting this
guy, he uses his money very efficiently,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what they're admitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whack him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when all the world leaders were
here, we bought full-page ads in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: daily papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen them?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in the cafe, actually,
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at that full-page ad there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about them, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you describe it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was during the national event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Clinton was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this issue of the newspaper that we
bought an ad in was really a corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: suck-up section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all about APEC so that APEC leaders
could read about themselves and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: at APEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the ads were like BC,
TAL, FedEx, full-page corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one expected us to take advantage
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it in the mail automatically as a
routine thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, we'll buy full-page ads in
all the daily papers that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had one of the big headlines,
it's time to end the war on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got the cannabis culture of
Canada welcomes APEC leaders and delegates
[SPEAKER_00]: to the North America's marijuana
breadbasket, British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the headline, and I'm just thinking
there must have been a lot of big Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: guys who just really had a heart attack
when they wrote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the guys from Malaysia and
Singapore are going, we kill people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, come and have a smoke with
us four blocks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was only four blocks away from
the Pan Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invited all the leaders to come down
and have a talk with me and check it out
[SPEAKER_00]: and discuss why they still think marijuana
should be illegal if they're so concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we also cited the human
rights record of each country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd go that marijuana traders are
executed in China, Singapore, Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, 640,000 people are
put in jail, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Washington and Thomas Jefferson,
you know, sewed hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bill Clinton wants to put everybody in
jail that does so today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made fun of the fact that America
still calls itself a pluralistic democracy
[SPEAKER_00]: in the land of the free while locking up
everybody in sight who doesn't agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: the president's point of view on
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we tried to shame and
embarrass them and pointed that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: decent people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're your leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're your children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're your teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're your uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the kid next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the people who sell you stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the people who work with you,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it was idiotic to advocate any
kind of policy that put us in jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as which it was good medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We listed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great for fiber, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a wonderfully articulate,
beautiful thing on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got Hemp BC Cannabis Cafe in the
Little Grow Shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then invite everybody to come down and
check us out four blocks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got any new visitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got nine delegates from APIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a lot, considering they'd
have to have the nerve to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think four of them were Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was American.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two were from Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to remind everybody that this
interview has been brought to you by the
[SPEAKER_02]: Campaign for the Restoration and
Regulation of Hemp, our political action
[SPEAKER_02]: committee, which is the sponsors of the
Oregon Cannabis Tax Act, the petition over
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so please help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make the vision of Vancouver, BC become
the reality down here in Oregon by giving
[SPEAKER_02]: us a phone call, 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paul, remind us what the initiative
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will tax and regulate the sale of
marijuana to adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll allow adults to cultivate marijuana
for personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll allow farmers to cultivate the drug
for sale through liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll allow medical patients to receive
prescriptions through pharmacies at cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will tax adult marijuana sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will allow farmers to cultivate
industrial hemp to produce thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: products, everything from the diesel in
our trucks to the paper on our books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fabric on our back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I'm excited
about with our initiative and the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect of it, that allows the doctor and
patients to decide what to use marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: for, what to use cannabis for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other initiatives going around
the country, there's like a set list of
[SPEAKER_02]: what a doctor can say it's good for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not on the list,
well, you're out of luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's between a doctor and a patient,
the way it should be, in pure freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: No prohibitions, no regulations on doctors
or on patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a call and help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send back petitions if you've already got
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time's going short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or call us if you haven't got a petition
yet or if you lost yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And help us make it legal here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can invite Mark Emory down here
once it's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he can, the greatest marijuana smoker
in North America, he's called,
[SPEAKER_02]: or the world this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess some of the media's calling him.
[SPEAKER_02]: The world's greatest marijuana smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we can have him down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we change those laws, because he
doesn't want to come down here while
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot more freedom up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no sense in him coming down here
and facing the wrath of the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: fascist state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So call us and get these petitions at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I guess we're back to the
conclusion of the Mark Emory interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back with the politics part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was really important,
and this is what really hurt us late on,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ads got re-reported all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York Times picked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of American press picked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: European television filmed at the Cannabis
Cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reuters came in and we got calls from
France and Germany said they'd seen us
[SPEAKER_00]: there, interviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got very syndicated magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it kept going outward like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily newspapers would comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the thing is, the great thing is
the newspapers delivered during a boring
[SPEAKER_00]: news day as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was endless people commenting on
this incredibly cool ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would read it aloud and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it got everything I wanted to get
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is I knew there would be
repercussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when CNN was here and they just
wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last question they said,
so do you think there'll be any negative
[SPEAKER_00]: repercussions to you being on this show?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at the guy real up close and
I said, well, don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, of course I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it's probably the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, but it's a good way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're still doing Cannabis Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's stable too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not nearly danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was three weeks ago when after we were
forced out of our retail business,
[SPEAKER_00]: our printer demanded all the money for the
last issue and a half of this month's
[SPEAKER_00]: right up front now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found it for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least we're really caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never been as well caught up in
Cannabis Canada as we are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's stable here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not involved in really anything
else at the moment other than I give a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you want an interview about pot
and you want it to be favorable,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to call me up because you
just have to quote me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most journalists are in favor of
marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by calling me, you know you're going to
get what you want because they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: suitably propagandized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know what to promote too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most journalists are getting good at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they call me up because they know
they're going to get great quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I convince people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally convince people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate has gone from 39% of Canada
wanting legalization only three years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: four years ago, and now 51%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 61% of the country wants legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in British Columbia, it went way off
the scale, 63%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that means you've got 33%
that either said they were against
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana or didn't have an opinion or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where you've got 63% are willing to
say, yes, conclusively, I want marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a much more hardcore
pro-marijuana segment of our society than
[SPEAKER_00]: you have anybody who cares about making it
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the people who are against
it are ambivalent at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't concern them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe their teenage son took
marijuana, smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't like how he turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since then, they're against marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tends to be the calmest kind of
reason to be against any kind of drug that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever heard is not because in and of
itself prohibition works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that I didn't like my kid doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want him to ever see it again,
blah, blah, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, it should be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are always irrational, nonsensical
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the people in favor
of prohibition, they're always total
[SPEAKER_00]: idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when people look at white
supremacists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you worried about white
supremacists?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, they're all Mongoloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in the master race.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people that couldn't get
accepted in the lowest social club.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have shaved heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a little off to the side,
like a little egghead-type things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, wearing bizarre things out in
Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best fucking place for those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's isolate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send them to Montana, Idaho,
and hope they never show up to the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want to do with those
people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, most times people get worked up
over nothing, and they ignore all the real
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any, what's your vision of
the future of the magazine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to put out more
magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pot puzzle book coming out
that's lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cannabis Canada will issue,
like Avalon Sun's Flash, the holding
[SPEAKER_00]: company, which I'm the president,
will put out more magazines of different
[SPEAKER_00]: subject matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to like diversify.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still going to handle the mail over
here, and that'll expand in this
[SPEAKER_00]: department.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll just go a little slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, after all, the other things are
well in place, and other people can look
[SPEAKER_00]: after those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also got to pay $100,000 in debts
because I pass on the businesses in a
[SPEAKER_00]: debt-free environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No money down debt-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you know, I know you'll be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got stuck with debt, so I have to
pay down about $100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, they'll get it in the next
two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we'll consider new projects at
that point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, I'm in businessman mode,
paying off the old debts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, well, when I say businessman mode,
I still give like five to 10 interviews a
[SPEAKER_00]: day of that kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like on Saturday, we're on the front
page of the London Free Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cafe was on the front page of the
Toronto Star on the same day last
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a full page article on me in the
Daily Paper this Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another article coming up later
on this week in the Vancouver Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This magazine's writing an article on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's in Saturday Night Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got radio shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the great thing about being seen in
Rolling Stone and the Wall Street Journal
[SPEAKER_00]: is, hey, those are the A list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the triple A list.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've been acknowledged by those in
the 60 Minutes Calls, ABC News.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got an ABC News special coming out
in April, one hour special called Victims
[SPEAKER_00]: of Victimless Crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll probably get me more trouble
because what I do is I go to a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operation here where the guy's got 1,000
plants in his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they ask me to describe what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they say, what would a guy get if he
were caught in various parts of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, starting with Oklahoma,
you'd get 50 to 100 years minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Florida, Texas, Arkansas, and enlisted
off of about seven or eight others,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd get 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enlisted in about 20 other states,
you'd get 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every other state in the America,
I said, because 1,000 plants is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: federal, I said, you're going to get
minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandatory minimum of five years,
absolutely without question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely 10 to 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, this guy would get $2,000 fine if
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since he's in Inglid, he'd get last May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's disabled, so they probably would
say, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basically, the judges say,
who cares anyway, unless you're there for
[SPEAKER_00]: the 10th time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be before some judges with
quite a rap sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worse for me because they piled
the charges on to make it look bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the police have to, from their
perspective of fighting a war,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like the enemy general's right over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could kill him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would cause more trouble,
and it's worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to hassle him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of things to marginalize or
disable my effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to go into court all the time
and show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It soaks up all my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never have any spare money to buy
full page ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be able to start any businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's their way of waging war.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a couple of lines I often use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it's good to be underestimated for
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never knew how good I really was at
this until it was too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I liked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think, well, how much trouble could
he be?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got one hamster four years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't we just beat him up and throw
him in an alley when we had the chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now they're stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got to play ball because I'm
actually one of the most well-known people
[SPEAKER_00]: from British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've attracted tons of money that nobody
really wants to turn away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really good at what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm the kind of person everybody
could be proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC is proud of me because I make BC sound
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make BC sound tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pod smokers are proud of me because I look
so dignified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't look like a typical hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an employed person with children,
concerns like every other middle class
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops like me because I'm polite,
not a problem, type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if they're beating up your employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even if they're beating up your
employees, if all I do is spit on you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could be thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I was in America, maybe I'd
have a gun or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pot smokers in Canada are
surprisingly docile, passive people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're peace lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're not prone to fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not surprising that we're one way
victims in this drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is, we're winning while being
abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sooner or later, people realize the
injustice of the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're very slow to act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very cowardly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people value money and comfort above
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, ironically, they'll lose
that too if they don't pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In four years, we've just made dramatic,
rapid progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's not fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have, without government
subsidy, made marijuana out of British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia, the best in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cheapest in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've increased production by about three
or four times in the last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start off with bullshit, some seeds,
some water, and the natural sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, a very small investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three months later, some Americans
give me a big wad of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes and takes this marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he burns it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He burns it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has to come back for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least when people buy a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: That car's going to last five years
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pot doesn't last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got to come back for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is a perfect economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: From water, bullshit, and a bit of time,
you come up with a multi-billion dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: industry where everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that as taxpayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, this interview has been
brought to you by the Campaign for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Restoration and Regulation of Hemp,
the sponsors of our initiative drive,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can have here in Oregon that same
turnaround, as Mark said, two weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: they burn it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can create that industry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to do that with our
petition, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have our petitions, if you're
one of the people who's already called us
[SPEAKER_01]: and had us send them to you, send those
back in right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need all of our petitions in no later
than the end of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you send them in, we'll mail you
back some more right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't got them, call us at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside of the Portland area,
503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only registered Oregon voters can sign and
circulate this petition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need 73,000 signatures by the end
of June to put this thing on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here in early April, what are we at?
[SPEAKER_01]: About 24,000?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, somewhere around there in early
April.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have any questions about the
initiative, give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be happy to tell you how to make
sure to fill it out correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure, you know, just one county
solely on one page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you get that right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only Lane County.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can sign on Lane County page.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't mix Lane County and Douglas
County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we mail them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of mail you out an instruction
sheet as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that doesn't make sense,
give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a live person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually Bruce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce can walk you through it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us a call and help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we really need you to help us out
to bring freedom back to Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring back that whole economy that Mark
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it's just a wonderful thing that,
you know, people can buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two weeks later, they have to go
buy more because they've smoked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let our farmers do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to keep this wealth here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not export it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So help us put the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act
on the ballot to tax and regulate adult
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana sales, legalize industrial hemp,
legalize personal possession and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, and regulate medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just regulate marijuana,
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It frees medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the choice between a doctor and a
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: In closing, I am a candidate for Oregon
State Representative in the Oregon House
[SPEAKER_01]: of Representatives in House District 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in inner southeast Portland
and the little far northeast corner of
[SPEAKER_01]: inner northeast Portland, please vote for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: For state representative on the May
Democratic primary, if you're a registered
[SPEAKER_01]: Democrat or you're not registered with the
party, you're an independent, you can vote
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Democratic primary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul Stanford for House District 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get our petition to stop the drug war.
Thank you.
