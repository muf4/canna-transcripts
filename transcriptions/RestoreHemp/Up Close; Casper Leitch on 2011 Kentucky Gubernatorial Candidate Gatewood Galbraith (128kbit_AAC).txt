[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I must say it's been an honor to
know Gatewood the number of years that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him back, it was Earth Day,
and it was 1991, and we were filming
[SPEAKER_00]: segments for Tiny for Hemp in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd gone up to San Francisco,
Ed Rosenthal wanted to be a guest on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, and we had anticipated spending the
day filming a big interview with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed was going over his library of books
that he'd written, and about an hour
[SPEAKER_00]: before I and the camera crew and the sound
crew got there, Ed apparently thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a good time to drop two hits
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't much to interview at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went down to Earth Day a little
early, and Jack Harrod said that a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: of his by the name of Gatewood Galbraith
was going to be around, and we should try
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it a point to get Gatewood on the
program as a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that Gatewood was running for
governor of Kentucky, and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he's running for governor of
Kentucky, and I said, and he smokes pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack Harrod said, yeah, and he'll make
a great guest, so you should make it a
[SPEAKER_00]: point to talk with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those of you who've known me a long
time may know that my family has a
[SPEAKER_00]: political background in the state of
Indiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom was the first female to be
president of the county council in our
[SPEAKER_00]: area and in the history of Delaware
County, and she broke a lot of ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a woman's liver, as we called them
back then, and she taught me at an early
[SPEAKER_00]: age the importance of one, standing up for
yourself and being who you are and true to
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, which Gatewood represented as a
candidate, and she taught me the ins and
[SPEAKER_00]: outs of politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew after hanging out with Jack
Harrod that even though he had the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: about making paper and fiber and fuel out
of this fantastic plant, that unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: make a change in Congress or you make a
change in the Senate, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a whole lot done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to be educating people
about the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I heard that we had somebody from
the marijuana movement running for
[SPEAKER_00]: governor of a state, that impressed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to that point, I had known Jack Harrod
and the intellectual aspects of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, of the history of this entire
travesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had worked on the California Hemp
Initiative, and I saw with Jack Harrod how
[SPEAKER_00]: through politics, you can make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea at that time, when Gatewood
was running for governor, coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the closet about smoking marijuana and
talking about using the revenue that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from generating taxes, from creating
industries that are built on making
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous products from this plant,
on how we were saving the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we were saving dollars,
it all made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly, not only did we have Jack
Harrod's knowledge, we had the sensibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of Gatewood Galbraith as a candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another aspect about Gatewood,
unlike a lot of us in the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, when I came into the marijuana
movement, I came in because Jack Harrod
[SPEAKER_00]: needed somebody to run his office while he
went on the road to talk about paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack came into the movement because some
lady introduced it to him and he wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, that's how you made the
book about getting high, high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've all heard that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gatewood came into it because his
grandfather and his great-grandfather and
[SPEAKER_00]: his great-great-grandfather and his
great-great-great-grandfather, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who knew Jesus in your family,
all grew marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't grow it to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it to make oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it to make rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it to make papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it as an industry, and as they
were doing so, they were making an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that was considered one of the
wealthiest commonwealths in the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I had somebody from the belly of
the beast getting ready to sit down and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to me for the first time in a very
ragged, rational, intellectual way that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been dealt with before on my
level in politics, my level meaning the
[SPEAKER_00]: voter, the person who's going to be voting
in New York, Kentucky, Maine, somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: works on candidates' campaigns and knows
how to put together the importance of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the fine points of how do we get a
candidate elected and all the key reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't come in here and go,
we want to get high, which we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and by the way, those of you who are
very comfortable knowing that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: outlawed this plant because it keeps those
of us from getting high, no, it just keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: you from getting taxes from us getting
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gatewood talks sensibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interview that I did with Gatewood,
when I showed it to my parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: very conservative, Midwesterns running for
office, my mom, very well known in
[SPEAKER_00]: politics on a statewide level,
very active campaigner, they were blown
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their comment was, this man should be
governor of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got done talking with Gatewood for
the very first time, it made sense to me
[SPEAKER_00]: that he should be governor of any state.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first person who was actually
talking, dollars and cents, get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and noise industries and bring in
the green industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you hear now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost wanted to throw up in my own
mouth when I heard Al Gore stand before
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress and talk about getting rid of the
smoke and noise industry and bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the green industry, and he said everything
that Gatewood said except for one word,
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: When President Obama addressed the United
States after this horrible horrific spill
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Gulf, he stood before America and
promised to set us free from foreign oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were going to take care of the
problems that developed this mess off of
[SPEAKER_00]: our shores, and he said everything that
Gatewood Galbraith has been saying for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years except for one word, hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a little agitated when I talk about
our politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too late now for any politician to
stand up in front of me and you and
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else in this country and say,
oh, I didn't know that you can make paper
[SPEAKER_00]: and fiber and fuel out of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I had no idea we were spending this
much money putting all these people away
[SPEAKER_00]: behind bars when we should take that money
and put it into the school systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: My gosh, I had no clue to this travesty
because people like Gatewood Galbraith has
[SPEAKER_00]: been standing on the corners of every
street corner in this nation saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth along with Jack Hare, along with Dr.
Todd Miccareo and Keith Straub,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every other hardworking activist that
has known the truth for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone like Gatewood Galbraith
says to me, he's running for office,
[SPEAKER_00]: for governor of the state of Kentucky,
and it's his intention to take this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the revenue from this plant, and generate
from it jobs that will benefit those
[SPEAKER_00]: people living in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The revenue will help benefit schools for
the children going there to get their
[SPEAKER_00]: brains fed in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take care of the health care
problems for the senior citizens that are
[SPEAKER_00]: facing a federal bankruptcy of our Social
Security in 13 years in Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: that he has a solution to the problems in
Kentucky that will ultimately bring
[SPEAKER_00]: forward a solution to the problems in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He handed out 20 years ago a book to
everybody who would pay mind to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the marijuana feasibility study,
how you would take this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into our economy, began to take it,
put it into fuels by just changing the car
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit here, by putting it into the
papers and the fibers and the fuels and
[SPEAKER_00]: making the jobs and the revenue and the
taxes and how we would stop putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: money into the prison system and into the
court systems and we could save the
[SPEAKER_00]: taxpayer and we would have a beautiful
society that was designed to educate our
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens and stimulate creativity and to
bring forward an environment low on crime
[SPEAKER_00]: that would not cost the taxpayers a large
amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spoke to me as a voter looking for
solutions to horrific problems that laid
[SPEAKER_00]: at my feet and the feet of my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the impact that I had from
Gatewood Galbraith when he sat down and
[SPEAKER_00]: took time for hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when Gatewood took time for Casper,
over the years, as a friend, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it with the planet sometimes and
I would call Gatewood up and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world's beat me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get off the phone and I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm regenerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gatewood's been there when I said,
Gatewood, the world loves me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a friend, we've laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the merit of this man,
the character of this man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there hasn't been a time that this man
has let me down as a friend or as a
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen of my nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I am most baffled by is how
it is he has not been elected yet to the
[SPEAKER_00]: seat of the governor of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks rational.
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks plain English.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who's going to go and put
their vote on any candidate is looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who speaks the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plain English.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I've never understood how it is
a man who had the answers to the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: this state faces has yet been able to do
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our country is facing a horrific
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that by the end of May,
over half of the United States is in
[SPEAKER_00]: bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 20 states have already filed
bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_00]: State stimulus are going belly up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal stimulus are being taken from
the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by July, August, another 10 or 15 will
be filing bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the year, maybe all but
three will go under.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are cutting funds for our children's
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear every day when I wake up,
we're closing schools here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shutting down libraries in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cutting members off the police
department in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, we're laying off state workers
in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear how our nation was held hostage by
our Congress because they couldn't figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out this handful of money on this budget
that equaled to what they spend on the war
[SPEAKER_00]: on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I don't hear from anybody but people
like Gatewood and Ron Paul and Dennis
[SPEAKER_00]: Kucinich, what I don't hear from my
Congress, what I don't hear from my Senate
[SPEAKER_00]: are answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Answers that has been given to them in
plain English and a book and books by Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herr, books called The Feasibility Study
by Gatewood Galbraith, books by Ed
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosenthal, books by Ethan Nadelman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell me you're stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't play me as stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why every time Gatewood says he's
running for governor, I always say I
[SPEAKER_00]: expect to be in the governor's office with
you on election day.
