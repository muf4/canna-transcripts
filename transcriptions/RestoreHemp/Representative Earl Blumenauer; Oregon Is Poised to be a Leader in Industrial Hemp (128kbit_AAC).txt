[SPEAKER_00]: 20 states have passed pro-industrial
legislation and, more telling,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 states, including Oregon, have passed
legislation that remove barriers to its
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Colorado, Kentucky,
Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty wide range of states all across the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I think most of you know,
hemp products are perfectly legal today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a retail market in hemp products
we think is about half a billion dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I frankly think that's understated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've watched the estimates since I've
been working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The estimates kind of go up about the
range of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you that I'm convinced if
we're able to move forward with actual
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp cultivation in Oregon and other
states, I think that market is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be more competition for it,
and it can be grown locally, not imported
[SPEAKER_00]: from Europe or Canada or Kamchatka or
someplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the supply line is shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the competition is greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that means that it's going to
have overall an opportunity to make hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: products even more competitive than they
are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, I think the attention that
is going to be directed as a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in Oregon and other
states, we're going to watch the expansion
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think there will be more attention,
more involvement, and I think you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see even more commercial application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my point of view, it's gone from
less than a third of a billion to half a
[SPEAKER_00]: billion, and I think it's going to expand
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some of the products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hemp flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gerald Polis and I arranged for it to be
flown over the United States Capitol.
[SPEAKER_00]: On July 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's important to clear up the
misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why don't you repeat after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp is not marijuana,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You ought to practice that in other
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less than three tenths of a
percent of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can argue about outdated drug laws
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is marijuana really worse than
heroin and meth?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a debate for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of your view, about other drug
laws, this is not a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to come together to help
people understand that and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to people who've been
cornering me for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you have been stalking me in this
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point has been well taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been working as part of a
whole range of issues in Congress to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, part of what's interesting for me is
that the controversy surrounding marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to help us sweep through some of
the misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, 21 states in the District of
Columbia have legalized medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 110 million people live in states
that have medical marijuana where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this fall, two states, Washington and
Colorado, voted to legalize adult
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened is this has set up an
interesting conflict with federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, not debating the merits one way
or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But President Obama famously said when
challenged, is the Department of Justice
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be prosecuting Colorado officials
for doing what they're required to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state constitution, which over 55% of
the people told them to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the President said that he had bigger
fish to fry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had the statement from the
administration, which was logical in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to avoid an unfortunate conflict between
the state and federal authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have bigger fish to fry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem was that there were 83
independent U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys who were frying those smaller
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sought and obtained clarification
from the Department of Justice that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would not essentially be prosecuting
people who were operating under the color
[SPEAKER_00]: of state law and set up some conditions
whereby that would be respected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this helps us even more because if
you can have a regimen in these states
[SPEAKER_00]: where medical or recreational marijuana is
legal, you can do this to the satisfaction
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ought to be a no-brainer to set up a
system whereby him meets that criteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: would not be prosecuted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, for me, exciting to have that
guidance from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney laying out the priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even more important for us in Oregon,
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney Amanda Marshall has stated that
her position will be to rely on state and
[SPEAKER_00]: local authorities to address localized
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a recent letter, and we've made
copies, I think, from U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney Marshall, the Department expects
that states which legalize cultivation or
[SPEAKER_00]: use of cannabis, whether for industrial
purposes, medical purposes, or otherwise,
[SPEAKER_00]: will establish them for strict regulatory
schemes that protect the eight federal
[SPEAKER_00]: interests that are identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take a trust but verify
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as the state follows through
in imposing those controls, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: likely that there will be any threatened
federal action will be less necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the actual language.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, if that's the case for
marijuana, it certainly informs the
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ought to be easier, more direct,
and virtually no reason that there would
[SPEAKER_00]: be any involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important for us to give
clarification to the men and women who may
[SPEAKER_00]: decide to be involved that they're not
going to be interfered with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that it gives the assurance to
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state has been extraordinarily,
I think, forthcoming on this with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture and the state
legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, I think, well positioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll actually have an opportunity to hear
from a representative from the State
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may have noticed the last few
months have not necessarily been the
[SPEAKER_00]: shining moments for the United States
Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some controversies and
some dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, one of the highlights in a
really miserable period was watching in
[SPEAKER_00]: this Congress moments of bipartisanship
around the hemp issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the farm bill debate, together with
a colleague from Colorado, Jared Polis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one from Kentucky, Thomas Massey,
a Republican from Kentucky, who has agreed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be our lead with the legislation in
Congress, we offered what we thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the simple common sense amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always a danger sign in
Congress, because those are the first to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would allow colleges and universities
to grow and cultivate hemp for academic
[SPEAKER_00]: and agricultural research purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passed with bipartisan support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 225 votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that provision is still on the table
for the farm bill discussion we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working for the conference
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the stuff that's going to be
in the bill makes me cringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm going to be able to
vote for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're going to be able to keep
this provision and be able to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: else that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just to give a clear signal to
Oregon agriculture that it is appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to go forward if they cultivate
it as they see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us to be able to do the research
that OSU is capable of doing, they do
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing things there to help other Oregon
industries, from the cheese makers,
[SPEAKER_00]: people who brew beer, wine, small fruits
and vegetables, their forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they are not just American
experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're global experts at OSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tremendously powerful research capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they might be able to do research
on him, in terms of how to grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: in product applications, that is a part of
establishing a new element for Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to hear from an all-star
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've stalled long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got everybody here who's
going to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, thank you Cable Access.
[SPEAKER_00]: For being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're on your exercise machine at
two in the morning and just don't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to do and you're tired of
watching speeches on the floor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: house on C-SPAN reruns, you'll be able to
watch this and listen from our experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to acknowledge how helpful the
Department of Agriculture's Katie Koba has
[SPEAKER_00]: been.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the director.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking through with her the nature of
this federal partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole Foods, a leader in adapting
alternative products to retail markets and
[SPEAKER_00]: helping them become more mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing from Rick Rutherford and Oregon
Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just met for the first time from Dufour,
who's interested in doing a deep dive and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the stakes are high for
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to strengthen our
economy, particularly what happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: rural and small town Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to have one more product that
they can cultivate that has a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, I think is a step towards
helping the economy in an area that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: battered by the recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we research, grow, and be able to have
access to him, I think it's also going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help small entrepreneurs, people who have
ideas for hemp products that can be more
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable and accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to unleash other areas
of economic activity because this is part
[SPEAKER_00]: of an effort that we need to do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to support and encourage this
process being set up with the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to learn from one another,
and we want to inform the public so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: lay the foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like Oregon to be a leader as we
move to the point where it is clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be authorized under federal
statute, and we are doing more for
[SPEAKER_00]: research and product development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Oregon, once again, is placed to be a
real leader.
