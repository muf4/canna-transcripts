[SPEAKER_01]: In the rhyme of match These embers of
torch Sweeting the light What you do to me
[SPEAKER_01]: This temptation of heat Craving your
liquid That deep fire The sweet rushing
[SPEAKER_01]: flame And embracing of stirring Your name
is the spark Fire starting this roar
[SPEAKER_01]: Blazing through my heart Much is said
about love But love seems too tame With no
[SPEAKER_01]: way to explain Our wilding of gentle The
[SPEAKER_01]: reality of dream The closing of close
Melting destiny and fate What is meant to
[SPEAKER_01]: be This unraveling of knee The drenching
of desire And it all started with your
[SPEAKER_01]: smile And embracing of stirring Your name
is the spark Fire starting this roar
[SPEAKER_00]: Blazing through my heart Much is said
about love But love seems too tame With no
[SPEAKER_01]: way to explain Our wilding of gentle In
[SPEAKER_01]: the rhyme of match These embers of torch
Sweeting the light What you do to me This
[SPEAKER_01]: temptation of heat Craving your liquid
That deep fire The sweet rushing flame And
embracing of stirring Your name is the
spark
