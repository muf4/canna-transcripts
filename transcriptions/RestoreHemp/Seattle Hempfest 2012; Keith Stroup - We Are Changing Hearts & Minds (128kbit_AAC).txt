[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, this is LK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here at Seattle Hempfest with the man
himself, Eastrop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The founder of Normal Guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world's oldest marijuana smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of the event?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bigger every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a special effort to come out again
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure I was going to come and I
started thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been 14 in the last 15 and it is the
world's largest pot festival and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope never to miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you've been to a few of homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crowd lasted yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, massive, massive crowds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to think that it's pulled together by
volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people think you can't still do
effective political organizing on a local
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think their budget is something
like a half a million dollars for this
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is totally run by volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one gets paid a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is beautifully organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Vivian McKeek and all the good folks at
Hempfest, you do great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make us proud as stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really are finally winning this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that we're tricking people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a majority of support in the
entire country now that supports
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Normal was founded, Gallup Hold had
just done their first question on
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization and we only enjoyed 12%
support in the entire country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that hard work people have done out
there has paid off, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won their hearts and minds.
