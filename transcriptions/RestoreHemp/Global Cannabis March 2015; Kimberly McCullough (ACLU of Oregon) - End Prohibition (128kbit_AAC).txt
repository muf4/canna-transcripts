[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just feel so privileged and proud to
be here with all of you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kimberly McCullough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the legislative director with the ACLU
of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell you a little bit about the
ACLU before I get into everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so you know, because not everybody
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: ACLU has been around for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on the front lines of pretty
much every civil rights and civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberties issue in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a nonpartisan nonprofit
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work on free speech, racial justice,
prisoners' rights, human rights,
[SPEAKER_00]: humane police practices, privacy,
religious liberty, reproductive rights,
[SPEAKER_00]: LGBT rights, immigrant rights,
and much, much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe these rights are fundamental to
a free society, and that's why we fight
[SPEAKER_00]: every day across the country in the courts
and in the legislatures and also through
[SPEAKER_00]: public education.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm sure you all agree, the war on
marijuana is a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has needlessly ensnared hundreds of
thousands of people in the criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: justice system at a tremendous cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than half of all drug-related
offenses in the state of Oregon are for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last decade, Oregon police have
arrested and cited more than 95,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregonians for marijuana possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the equivalent of arresting or
citing every single person in the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: city of Hillsboro.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, we spent over $50 million
enforcing marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's more, the war on marijuana has been
enforced along color lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though black and white Oregonians use
marijuana at about the same rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: black Oregonians are roughly two times
more likely to be cited or arrested for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana offenses, and some areas of
Oregon are actually even worse than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Lane County, it's 3.5 times worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 3.5 times more likely for doing the
same thing at the same rate as everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last November, Oregon voters said enough
is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our money and resources should be spent on
measures that actually keep our
[SPEAKER_00]: communities safe, like investigating
serious crimes and reinvesting in public
[SPEAKER_00]: health programs, including drug treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than wasting time and money
clogging our courts and jails and
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying lives and families,
the people of Oregon voted to legalize and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, what the voters
absolutely did not say is, let's throw
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana users under the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are sick need access to their
medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are sick need access to their
medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ACLU was right there with you fighting
for the medical marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will continue to fight to protect
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The voters also did not say endanger our
privacy and over-regulate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet some of the proposals that have been
made in the Oregon legislature this
[SPEAKER_00]: session would do just that if enacted into
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the legislative director for the ACLU,
I'm down in the Capitol every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been fighting very, very hard to
ensure the privacy of our medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, the privacy of our recreational
users, and to make sure that these new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations don't just simply create
another method of criminalizing marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also absolutely dedicated to work with
Representative Frederick and anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: who wants to get involved to expunge all
nonviolent marijuana-related convictions
[SPEAKER_00]: from Oregon residents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes absolutely no sense to legalize
marijuana and not clear the records of
[SPEAKER_00]: people with marijuana offenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Oregonian should be serving time in
prison for marijuana, and no Oregonian
[SPEAKER_00]: should have to suffer the collateral
consequences of having a conviction for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for one more day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell you now unequivocally,
your voice is extremely important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's very powerful in Salem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm down in the Capitol, I hear
legislators regularly talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: communications that they get from the
people of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually does make a difference when
you sit down and write a letter,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly when you write it in your own
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please look up your legislators,
look them up online, email them,
[SPEAKER_00]: tell them what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them to enact fair and safe
guidelines for Measure 91, and hold them
[SPEAKER_00]: accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them to honor the will of the voters
who said it was time for a new approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, to honor the privacy of
Oregonians who used marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: to expunge marijuana convictions,
and to protect the medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also just, I have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to encourage you to support the
ACLU.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Membership is as little as $5 for
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look us up online, ACLU of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps make our voice stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to fight this fight
because we believe the criminal justice
[SPEAKER_00]: system is broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to end not just the war on
marijuana, but the war on drugs more
[SPEAKER_00]: generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug war has failed to improve public
safety and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's placed an unprecedented number of
people behind bars, and it's severely
[SPEAKER_00]: eroded our constitutional rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that search and seizure law,
all of those ways that the government
[SPEAKER_00]: invades our privacy, so much of that has
been done in the name of fighting the war
[SPEAKER_00]: on drugs instead of actually helping the
American people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together, I believe we can end the drug
war.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reverse the tide of mass
incarceration and protect our
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutional rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
