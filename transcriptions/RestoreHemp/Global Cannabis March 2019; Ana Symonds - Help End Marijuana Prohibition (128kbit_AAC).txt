[SPEAKER_00]: This activism, what we're doing now,
is more important than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis becomes an industry,
we need to fight to recognize that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still a social movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across our country, not everyone shares
the same rights we do here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep fighting for full
legalization, for people to stop being
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested and locked up for this medicinal
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for patients to have access to the
same medicine that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big step here in Oregon is we need
to push for this act to correct the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation errors that have come about in
allowing us to use our medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the OMP to be free for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see so many people who can't afford a
card, and then they're paying tax at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong on its face and principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need, you know, now that they've
pushed everyone out of the OMP,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have growers providing free
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need solutions, and we need the
activism of our leaders like Madeline and
[SPEAKER_00]: the others who are continuing to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's far from over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of you showing up here today is
a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activism is as simple as talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to your neighbors, talking to your
friends, and letting them know that just
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can go into a dispensary
doesn't mean that things are all set now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we have to fight harder than ever
to protect ourselves and our rights from
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Pharma, from the alcohol lobby and
tobacco lobby, and all of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: actors that are trying to degrade the
rights and the freedoms that so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people have fought so hard for and given
their lives, and that whole communities
[SPEAKER_00]: have been decimated by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for being here and being
a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very grateful to be among you as a
patient and citizen activist as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that we can all carry this
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, every day you have the
chance to make a difference just by
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing what you know, sharing your
knowledge, and keeping our communities
[SPEAKER_00]: straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaboration, not competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
