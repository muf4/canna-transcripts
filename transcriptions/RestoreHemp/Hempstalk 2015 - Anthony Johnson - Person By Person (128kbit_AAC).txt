[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's great to be here at hemp stock I
Appreciate the warm welcome and
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction I am just happy to have
played my part to help legalize and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate marijuana here in Oregon But
let's give it up for to Paul Stanford one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Giants of the movement you know
like to say That all the activists who are
[SPEAKER_00]: working today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all stand on the shoulders of Giants
And Paul Stanford is one of those Giants
[SPEAKER_00]: so really appreciate all the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had to do and You know I got involved
in Activism because I saw my
[SPEAKER_00]: african-american friends treated more
harshly than my white friends for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana offenses back in Missouri and
The first time we got a decriminalization
[SPEAKER_00]: measure on the ballot because we couldn't
stand To see young students have their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives ruined for marijuana within the city
limits of Columbia, Missouri We lost we
[SPEAKER_00]: only got 43% of the vote, but then we got
right back on the ballot again And we got
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 60% of the vote the next time we
made the ballot decriminalizing marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: in the city limits of Columbia,
Missouri and Legalizing medicinal use for
[SPEAKER_00]: any patient so the patient finds
themselves in Columbia, Missouri they can
[SPEAKER_00]: possess up to 35 grams of medicinal
cannabis legally and Now that movement in
[SPEAKER_00]: Missouri is looking as move as moved on to
decriminalize marijuana in st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis Decriminalize marijuana,
Kansas City is now looking to pass a
[SPEAKER_00]: statewide Medical marijuana legalization
measure in 2016 and I think This movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of just step-by-step Person by person city
by city state by state is how we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to legalize marijuana fully you know here
in Oregon we had to Decriminalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana all the way back in 1973 the
very first state to decriminalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana And then we have to wait until
1998 to legalize medicinal cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: then in 2004 we tried to legalize medical
marijuana dispensaries it didn't pass 2010
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to legalize medical marijuana
dispensaries again It didn't pass and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the legislature legalized medical
marijuana dispensaries in 2013 you know
[SPEAKER_00]: then 2012 Paul and measure 80 campaign
team got a legalization measure on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot that would have legalized You know
possession for adults cultivation for
[SPEAKER_00]: adults it got 47% of the vote You know and
it didn't pass, but it laid the foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: for measure 91 each step of the way We get
closer and closer to true equality and
[SPEAKER_00]: true freedom and then after we passed
measure 91 We say we're not done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we're going to further
decriminalize marijuana We're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: further reduce marijuana penalties,
and we passed the first in the nation
[SPEAKER_00]: expungement provision that can help The
78,000 people get marijuana fences off
[SPEAKER_00]: their record But now that we've
accomplished that we're still not done You
[SPEAKER_00]: know we got true equality for employment
true equality for housing Education to
[SPEAKER_00]: have adult smoking sections at a festival
where they celebrate alcohol numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: times a year And we're going to do that
not because of me not because Of Paul not
[SPEAKER_00]: because of any other activists you may
hear about we do that because of people
[SPEAKER_00]: like you all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Step by step person by person you share
your stories about marijuana how marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: helps you medicinally how it helps you
relax How it's a better choice for you
[SPEAKER_00]: than alcohol or how it works well for you
and alcohol But you're not a bad person
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not deserve to be in prison You do
not deserve to be arrested and you deserve
[SPEAKER_00]: to have employment opportunities just like
everybody else so person by Person speak
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth about cannabis and the truth
shall eventually set us free so thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: very much everybody Keep up the good work.
