[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky was the world's largest producer
of hemp for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was our largest cash crop for more than
a century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine that, a state whose largest
cash crop was hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that the smoking aspect of it
was also well represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in the early 1900s,
it went down and they legalized it in 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky should be the place where
cannabis is returned as a cash crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started out a long time ago to try
to make that a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fourth generation Kentuckian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 24 years old in a milk land in 1971.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I decided I was grist for the mill,
that I was going to end up in prison or in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail or dead at an early age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided that I better learn the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I was just going to be a victim of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided I was going to go to college
and become an attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was at it, if I was going to
put that much into it, I might as well
[SPEAKER_00]: become governor and change the marijuana
laws in the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quit treating our people like we're in
occupied territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take the government out of the
helicopters, out of the air that are
[SPEAKER_00]: hovering over the fields and gardens of
the people of the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put marijuana into the hands of as
many sick and dying people and states as I
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I started out to do 40
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten up every day since that
time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've run for office in the state of
Kentucky on several occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my fifth time for governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also run for a agricultural
commissioner, attorney general,
[SPEAKER_00]: and congress twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've posed some mighty impressive numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bore you with them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me tell you that this time we is
the very best chance that I've ever had to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually win the governor of the state of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what that would do to the
political landscape in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an independent elected for the
first time in 150 years in Rhode Island
[SPEAKER_00]: last political season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had been a US state senator out of
that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he already had a statewide basis to go
independent with.
[SPEAKER_00]: My running mate and I are totally
independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No party affiliation whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lady running mate named Dee
Riley who's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother of six, two adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of her natural children has special
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows where the politics hit the road
about policies for women and children in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's smart as a tack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need more women in leadership roles
in the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am running this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, Galbraith, you're a perennial
candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where Kentucky's got perennial
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the people in Kentucky who had beaten
me had actually fixed the problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have had to run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't, and they have it,
and they can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because neither party could produce a
candidate for disengagement of
[SPEAKER_00]: partisanship long enough to work the other
side to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leadership of the parties in both
the major parties of the state of Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: had their horns locked up like two bulls
fighting over territory while the business
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people lays dead in the dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my running mate and I, I say that only
an independent who doesn't care who gets
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for doing what's right for the
people of the state of Kentucky stand the
[SPEAKER_00]: best chance of untying that Gordian knot
and letting both parties operate in a
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion that a lot of the well-intentioned
membership really want to want to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of it is we're not looking to
replace either party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking to throw the rascals
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking for you to vote against
your, you know, your representative or
[SPEAKER_00]: senator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want you to renounce your
family's party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not asking you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not asking you to vote for the
dreaded other party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're asking you to vote for an
independent who wants to work with you to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've offered myself again this
time, and the difference is there are
[SPEAKER_00]: several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all is that everybody's sick and
tired of the gridlock in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they say, I could accuse Kentucky of
being the victim of electile dysfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't seem to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we think is that we know for a
fact that we're already climbing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: polls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said last time they polled us about six
months ago at 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, what'd you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that's great with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we'll be 10% by May and 15 to
20% by September.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at 13% in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're moving on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really not spending any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have it to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never spent more than $20,000 on
any campaign in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spent $140,000 on this so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: $90,000 is my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I practice law for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live fee to fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I smell it this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell it this time that people are sick
and tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got endorsed by a union the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, why did you folks endorse me?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, because you've never lied to
us, Gatewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, hell, if I was going to
lie to you, I'd already been elected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were understanding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were cluing into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does an election for Gatewood,
Galbraith, and Kentucky mean for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people of the city of Portland and the
people of Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time in my memory,
that I've ever heard, the people of
[SPEAKER_00]: America are going to have a champion who
believes that when the founding fathers
[SPEAKER_00]: conferred sovereignty on us as human
beings, when they said that every human
[SPEAKER_00]: being is endowed by their creator with
life, liberty, and the pursuit of
[SPEAKER_00]: happiness, certainly inalienable rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the American Revolution came about,
we were all property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We belonged to the local king or queen,
to the local warlord, whoever possessed
[SPEAKER_00]: the most gunpowder in the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have any inalienable rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't have any inalienable rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the ruler said, hey, come in here,
off with their head, there you went.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nobody to intercede on your
behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the founding fathers took humankind
out of the category of property and
[SPEAKER_00]: conferred on them the concept of sovereign
human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self-determinative, individualized,
were something individually and something
[SPEAKER_00]: that the government couldn't take away or
mess with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wrote a constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Declaration of Independence didn't
become law, but the constitution they
[SPEAKER_00]: fashioned to try to immortalize that was
their attempt to write a set of laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to keep that project in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a human revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That conference of sovereignty on the
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they turned us loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that kind of freedom,
we've come in America, and that's the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it was supposed to have started out and
what we've been trying to keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that concept of individual sovereignty
is under great pressure today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the current generation is facing the
greatest threat of all of having the Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: of Rights just flat drawn out from
underneath us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the nanny state thought line of
protecting us from ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it is is absolute assault on the
privileges of sovereign human beings and
[SPEAKER_00]: sovereign citizens of the constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the right to life, liberty,
and pursuit of happiness is not a law
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is not in the constitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the state of Kentucky, the very
first section of the constitution of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Kentucky says that we're all
possessed of inalienable right to life,
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to reconstruct Kentucky's
policy and Kentucky's government around
[SPEAKER_00]: that thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to rediscover whether
America still has a pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to become the template
of what freedom of the individual means in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we'll become a tourist mecca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that people will come in from
all around the country and the globe to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what it likes to live free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about riots in the
streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about, you know,
people causing tumult out in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that the idea that we're
attempting it is going to bring in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right-minded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to try to spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to rediscover the
American Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do that by putting the
processes and the surpluses of a form of
[SPEAKER_00]: government out to the people instead of
special interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who those special interests are,
and I'm going to put a stop to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're savings we're going to put
back into the hands of the people.
