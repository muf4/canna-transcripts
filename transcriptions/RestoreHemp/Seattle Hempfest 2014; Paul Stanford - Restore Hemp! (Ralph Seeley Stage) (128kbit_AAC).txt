[SPEAKER_00]: I think that marijuana is the greatest
gift from our Mother Earth, God,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Creator, Gaia, the greatest gift that
our planet has given us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That HIP can restore all of our energy
needs, or at least a large percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can provide a huge resource in terms of
food and in fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason we have marijuana
prohibition is because it produces more
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel, fiber, food and medicine than any
other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They created a misinformation campaign to
call it marijuana 75 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm glad I-502 passed,
but it's really just partial
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not legal for you to have a single
marijuana plant, but this is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: productive plant known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it the most productive plant,
it produces more fuel, over 300 gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: oil per acre, more food, over 6 tons of
protein after you press the oil out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more fiber, 35 to 40 tons of fiber per
acre, while at the same time restoring the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil with the leaves and other processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It draws up subsoil nutrients and makes it
available in the next crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, until you can grow your own
cannabis, the law isn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I urge you to register, to vote,
get involved in the political process,
[SPEAKER_00]: and take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in the 60s they had this
saying, Timothy Leary popularized it,
[SPEAKER_00]: was tune in, turn on, tune in,
and drop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to turn on, tune in, and take
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This political system needs to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really- the people who
brought us marijuana prohibition were the
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
military, industrial, transnational,
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate, elite fascist sons of bitches,
and they're the ones who gave us this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we can restore hemp to its
rightful place in our economy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we grow hemp without regard to its THC
content, because low THC hemp is really
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about not growing the seed,
because we need the seed to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, get involved in the political process,
lobby for hemp, talk to your political,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, representatives, and run for
office yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take over the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I urge you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to run yourself,
support somebody who does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, it's really about restoring power and
control to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, all the money's flowing to
these petrochemical giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we take over, it can grow hemp
for fuel again without regard to its THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content, but according to the types of
hemp that are most productive,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means instead of the money going to
these Saudi kings and Swiss bank accounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll go to our farmers and into our
pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll change the whole economic
paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're keeping us down as long as they
keep hemp down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I urge you to work hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't accept this I-502 as the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana needs to be cheap and plentiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana isn't bad for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guns and tanks and riot gas couldn't stop
us from smoking grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to keep at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to grow the hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I urge you to get active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being involved out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And help restore hemp.
Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, give it up for Paul Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the utmost respect for this man.
