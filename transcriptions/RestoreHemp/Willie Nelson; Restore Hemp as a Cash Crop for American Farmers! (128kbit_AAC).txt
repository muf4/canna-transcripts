[SPEAKER_01]: American farmers are losing their farms at
a frightening rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For generations, this land and the
occupations that it provided were handed
[SPEAKER_01]: down from father to son.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, laws passed by
legislators have eroded this heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government and our nation's banking
system are slowly becoming this country's
[SPEAKER_01]: sole farm owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to turn the tide, the American
farmer needs a successful cash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now hemp is a plant that's proven to be
versatile in creating over 50,000 products
[SPEAKER_01]: from cloth and paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: To fuel and medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when prohibition was leveled against
liquor, it was still legal to grow corn
[SPEAKER_01]: and grapes for other purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this should be true of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Return our roots to America and help
re-legalize hemp.
Thank you.
