[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of response did you get when you
went public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get harassed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the police department come down on
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I describe it and have described
it for many years is it rained marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: on our house.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article that I read about finding it
on the doorstep and I laughed was totally
[SPEAKER_01]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found it in brown paper bags on our
doorstep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it through the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Postage paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also got it in the mailbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in a rural area and we have a
rural mailbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found it in the mailbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found it on the back porch and had many
people deliver it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking with Maynard today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I understand is that you began a
crusade in your state to re-legalize him.
[SPEAKER_00]: For medical purposes, that brought forth
on October 10, 1979 a history-making
[SPEAKER_00]: policy within your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we decided to go public, we decided
that we needed to be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We contacted the legislature to see if
there was a possibility that Michigan
[SPEAKER_01]: could do this and found that someone else
had been there before us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We joined the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keith went with us in early October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late in October, he was very ill and we
went without him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went 100 to nothing in the Senate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've forgotten what the count was in the
House.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed, it did go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean that in Michigan,
people can start using it for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the bill is passed, then it has to be
signed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was signed on October 22, 1979 by the
Lieutenant Governor of the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the day our son died.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to get my breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never received legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that, it was over a year before
the state received the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal government stands in your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan and 33 other states did pass
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed, the area we live in received the
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I received it personally from the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor that took care of Keith had
encouraged me to work on the legality of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: As time went on, he said to me,
I can't do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I understand too, I know it was
the government slow in getting hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana into the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time while it was coming in,
you were also getting hemp to other
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not after it got legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not after it got legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it got legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Keith died, we had a great deal of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what it would do and I would not
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not play games about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, then the doctor said to me,
he would send me patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to call them our patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone was saying, doctor,
I'm going to quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dying can't be worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would send them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, didn't you feel like you're breaking
a law?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I understand that people of your
generation have an ingrained thought when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to hemp to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brainwashing is called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's illegal, it shouldn't even be
discussed, let alone considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a different category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I frowned on my children using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about life and death.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a quality of life which is
important, but it's life and death.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many people who will die and I
know of several who have survived because
[SPEAKER_01]: they were able to use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dad told me just last year, this year,
that his son had cancer and he refused to
[SPEAKER_01]: take the treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of his buddies got him stoned so he
was so happy he really didn't care what he
[SPEAKER_01]: was doing, unaware that it could help the
nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: He continued his treatment and the young
man is alive and well today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you shared with me that there was a
Vietnam vet who was paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to him this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you tell that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a representative of disabled vets in
Southern Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had several vertebrates damaged during
the war and he did some rehab in a
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before he left, his physician took him
aside and said, I do not want you to take
[SPEAKER_01]: the drugs that the veterans organization
of the hospital is going to prescribe for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I want you to use marijuana,
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The young man was incontinent with his
bladder and his bowels and was paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said in five years he got so he could
walk five miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could also take a few steps without a
walker and that his incontinence was under
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I understand that AIDS sufferers,
people who are dealing with that disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: can find relief with AIDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an organization called MARS,
Marijuana AIDS Research Service,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's to help them apply for legal
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going better than others have,
but it's very slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many of them and the government
is saying they don't have the resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You commented that people with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a national television thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few months ago, and I received many,
many phone calls from people with various
[SPEAKER_01]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my recent ones was a young woman
with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was from New York State, couldn't
drive because of the seizures,
[SPEAKER_01]: and had tried the prescribed drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, somehow, someone talked to her
into smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was seizure free for two and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember right, she said two years in
her state and she could get her driver's
[SPEAKER_01]: license back, so she was back driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when this is used for medicinal
purposes, people think that you should,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that just smoking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go into the hospital room and
say, okay, doctor, I want to join her too,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have your friends bringing it in
off the street and fire it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the only way that it can be used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the best way?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fastest way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: For someone, a cancer patient,
I've talked to many.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have cancer because they smoke
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They simply cannot tolerate any other
smoke in their lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make depositories by making the
butter and putting them in a capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nurses told me for children,
poke holes in the capsule so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to wait quite so long for the
capsule to dissolve before the ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: get in the bloodstream, and also tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking that tea, for people my age,
we could drink an herbal tea without a
[SPEAKER_01]: blink of an eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was told this summer by a man who was
dying of cancer that the pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nausea, and the appetite, and that the
tea got into his system in like five
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other things, the brownies in
the depositories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the depositories are wonderful
because you don't throw them back up
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The digestive foods, brownies,
and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you said children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, realizing that hemp is an illegal
substance for Americans to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of unusual to hear someone
encourage that we give this to children.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a child dying and they are
giving you no hope, whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is hope, I have no problem with
that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know of any children that have
benefited from this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know of one child, to my knowledge,
and this was about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The child was so emaciated and there was
simply no other place in his body to poke
[SPEAKER_01]: a needle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to stop treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: To stimulate his appetite, they made him
brownies and teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was able to go back and continue his
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the best of my knowledge, the child is
alive and well today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I distributed what we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when it became legal, I no longer...
Well, I didn't have any more and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get any more, but it was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still worked with the doctor,
but I didn't work directly with patients
[SPEAKER_01]: using the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, he stopped using it and I was
angry and hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said to me, May, I cannot spend more
time doing paperwork than I do taking care
[SPEAKER_01]: of patients and I have to discontinue
using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 34 states where it was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, every doctor in every state,
not all of them received it, but the bills
[SPEAKER_01]: are dormant because the federal government
made it so difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horrendous for the doctors to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I understand of people who have
glaucoma and are applying for the hemp for
[SPEAKER_00]: their medical purposes, from what I
understand, the paperwork takes anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from a year to two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's horrendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The MARS project is attempting to... They
have cut it down until a doctor can do it
[SPEAKER_01]: in about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from what I understand, you also
testified before the DEA in 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what came from that and who did you
speak with when you were there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I testified in front of a Judge Francis
Young, very intelligent man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feeling of the people that I was
working with, normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to brush it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to finish our testimony and
15 minutes later, he was going to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He agonized over this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was only to make a recommendation to
the head of DEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't make the decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: He recommended wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had heard people all over the United
States from all different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: illnesses and said, in effect,
for God's sakes, help these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of response did he receive?
[SPEAKER_01]: The head of DEA, in effect, said drop
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're stupid.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you only have a couple of minutes
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, you commented that people
of an older generation than what I am have
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem at times being able to
restructure their thinking on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to say to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were told, and I came from an era that
if my government told me go out and stand
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the traffic, I'd probably
do it because they would never tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that was harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has taken me a long time to realize
this is no longer true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it never was, but I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may go away from the religion that you
were brought up as a child, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that I would ever be able to
smoke a marijuana cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've talked about Mars,
and there's probably a variety of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are watching this show who would like
to have the chance to find out more about
[SPEAKER_00]: your organization, or the organization,
Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Address and phone number, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through ACT, ACT, Alliance for
Cannabis Therapeutics, and they're based
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have an address or a telephone
number, but I'm sure that through normal
[SPEAKER_01]: high times, as an ad in it, there are many
places that they can contact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any final comment to our audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go with your gut feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you're right, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has really been a unique learning
experience having May on our show,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hope that the information that she
brought forth is something that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: digest and share with people around you
and you grow from.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people out there who
are suffering medically and need the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of the medicines that are derived
from the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage you to write your
congressman.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage you to write your senators,
and we encourage you to become more vocal
[SPEAKER_00]: in your community to bring this message
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to seeing you the next
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, May.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have you back on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to come back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
