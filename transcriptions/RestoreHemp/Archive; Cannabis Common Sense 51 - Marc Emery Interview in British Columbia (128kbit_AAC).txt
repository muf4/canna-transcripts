[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another exciting
edition of Cannabis Common Sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Common Sense is a production of
our political committee, the campaign for
[SPEAKER_01]: the restoration and regulation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're circulating this petition,
the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would now like to introduce our
attorney, our chief petitioner,
[SPEAKER_01]: my fellow chief petitioner actually,
the treasurer of our political committee,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the president of the Oregon Wildlife
Federation, Mr. Paul Loney.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks, Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's Paul Stanford, if you haven't
guessed yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the campaign for the restoration and
regulation of hemp, we have an initiative
[SPEAKER_02]: out there which Paul has displayed
proudly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: This initiative is a comprehensive
regulation of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow medical patients to purchase
marijuana at cost in pharmacies with a
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription from a doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would allow our farmers to grow
industrial hemp, the low THC variety,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will allow recreational cannabis to
be sold for profit at state liquor stores
[SPEAKER_02]: with the money going into our state
coffers to lower all of our tax rates,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the proceeds will then go into
funding real drug education programs and
[SPEAKER_02]: real substance abuse programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for the alcoholics and addicts that
need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, currently 90% of the
alcoholics who seek treatment can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're turned away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll fund that with millions,
maybe tens of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real hard to quantify what the black
market will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need your help to put this
important issue on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, as we're taping in early April,
we have about 24,000 signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need at least 50,000 more, really a
good segment more than that, no later than
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're one of the people who's been
watching this show for over a year now
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's been on and you've received our
petitions or you have them, send them back
[SPEAKER_01]: in to us right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need petitions, call us at
503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're inside the Portland area,
just 235-4606, because we want to send you
[SPEAKER_01]: these petitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need them back no later than the end of
June.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need those petitions as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you only have one or two signatures on
them, send them back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: In tonight's show, once again,
we continue to show you parts of our
[SPEAKER_02]: recent journey up to Vancouver,
B.C., the marijuana breadbasket of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific Northwest, and the leader in the
emerging cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will continue with Mark Emery,
the founder of Hemp, B.C., and still the
[SPEAKER_02]: publisher of Cannabis Canada, the magazine
all about the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still have, let's see, we have,
what is Mark going to be talking about in
[SPEAKER_02]: this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to talk about the politics
behind the prohibition and other issues
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding what's going on up there in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's been selling marijuana
seeds quite openly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, he's been quoted on the front
page with a picture on the Wall Street
[SPEAKER_01]: Journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually it's not a picture in the
Wall Street Journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those drawings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all they have in the Wall Street
Journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, if you're going to get anything
in the Wall Street Journal, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be one of those little etch-a-sketch
drawings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just to be perfectly truthful here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a photograph, but it's a picture,
a line drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's there in the Wall Street Journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been in Rolling Stone over the past
few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on CNN.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, he is the world's most famous
marijuana smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got to say, when I was up there
at Hemp, B.C., I got to sample some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: finest in British Columbia's herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a big tourist draw.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really cleaned up his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's cleaned up his neighborhood,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of the kind of real
encouraging things is that with his
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cafe and his retail store and the
legal assistance center all being on one
[SPEAKER_02]: block up there in West Hastings,
he has turned that block around from being
[SPEAKER_02]: a block full of down on his luck,
dirty... Boarded up stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, panhandlers everywhere and a lot of
hard drug addicts and alcoholics on the
[SPEAKER_02]: street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's a bustling, friendly street.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of his neighbors in the surrounding
area support him and thank him for
[SPEAKER_01]: building up the area, improving the area,
and bringing thousands of tourists
[SPEAKER_01]: streaming right into the edge of Gastown
in downtown Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think it's probably about time
to go to the interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this part of the interview,
he's going to be talking about people who
[SPEAKER_02]: have had to leave the United States
because of political pressure,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they were growers or because they
were outspoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the government who had to leave and
carried up these strains that were
[SPEAKER_02]: developed in California, Oregon,
Washington up to Canada and continued on
[SPEAKER_02]: with their experiments up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a quite fascinating process
of what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think without further ado,
go to the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I could be like some poor
bastards that I know who, at my first
[SPEAKER_00]: rate, a wonderful man named Will Smith
came up here from Oklahoma and he just got
[SPEAKER_00]: popped back in his own place.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in jail for 95 years and he's a...
No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Will Smith had 42 plants,
allegedly, and he agreed to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: because they said they wouldn't forfeit
his property, which his family still lives
[SPEAKER_00]: in, his children and his wife,
and he got 20 years for 42 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they figure he'll serve about 7 to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, how nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: 42 fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I've tripped over 42 fucking plants
in some people's grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had easily 42 plants in my
own grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around here, you might get $500 to
$1,000 fine for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years of a man's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no society so sick as would do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the United States of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bad, bad place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's thousands of Americans up here
who are weed refugees who have fled that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, George Van Patten's up here
living now writing about Canadian grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people have come up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we got our great pot in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: American War Resisters came up here from
1968 to 1972, and they bought all their
[SPEAKER_00]: best strains with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They settled in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave British Columbia,
which had no particular reputation for
[SPEAKER_00]: ever growing any good pot, they gave it a
fabulous gene pool to produce the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people stayed and we continued
to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the situation got hospitable here and
more so in the courts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, we ended up revolving
towards the greatest pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a lot of the stuff they
sell in Amsterdam, it's produced out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle, Oregon, and British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: More these days out of British Columbia
because there's more work going on here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense of genetics, breeding,
crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are happening so much faster here
than in the United States because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: really crushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hey, money is a great coward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is the expertise and the
money went north.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were smart and you wanted to grow
pot, this is where you'd grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Portland, of course, they've
recriminalized marijuana there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we stopped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank goodness about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be a terrible backward
step, terrible backward step for Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: that would really place it in the
backwaters, again, like Oklahoma,
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas, where your face would put the rest
of your life in jail growing pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why bother?
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice is just come up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to show people you're
American or Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to show them the cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that Cuba Gooding line goes,
show me the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still pretty relevant anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just get an Asian landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't bother you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're nice people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white people are too fucking nosy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go with Asians.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why those white supremacists are
wrong right there to pot growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't count on whitey to help you out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other people that turn you in,
they're calling 911.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the Chinese guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the East Indian guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want anybody knowing what
they're doing either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just going to shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's got their own private
business, except the white people seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: think that they have a right to be
everybody's business, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've got to go for an Asian
landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have good success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't get some immigrants who see this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably get lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get them all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next thing you know, they're acting
like Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Americans at heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always tell because they're noisy
if you give them a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you tell them, just remember,
if you get caught, yeah, you won't go to
[SPEAKER_00]: jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll get deported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, you get to go back to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's punishment enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be so American.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they tend to be a little more
racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more pushy, brassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like a New Yorker when you meet
them on a holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can always spot them in the
loudest course.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they never relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never went on a holiday there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most Americans actually are pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're in a foreign country
growing pie, you don't really want to draw
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody's attention, if you can avoid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, we've got some guys who are
American who are going to be deported.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got a refugee status claim
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Sus, who's from Oregon himself,
who invented Product 19 or developed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a grower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now having refugee hearings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've accepted initially his claim
that he's a weed refugee, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: our claim is, that he would face
substantial penalties going back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States that are unreasonable,
cruel, and unusual, which we can get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the basis of a claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cultivators don't go to jail here
in the first or second offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how big the crop is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in America, you're facing 10 years
that could easily be construed as cruel
[SPEAKER_00]: and unusual punishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's many people who have
unfortunately been locked away right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, send them our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them go to jail for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: America's not worth sticking around for
five or 10 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a guest to the United States
government in that situation, it's worth
[SPEAKER_00]: deciding to look for greener pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there any backlash at all,
you see, for anybody talking about weed
[SPEAKER_02]: immigrants coming up to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never had a single complaint from the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never seen a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never seen a letter in the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never seen any kind of criticism about
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically from the general public at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the people you see criticism
from are always cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always trying to spread some
bizarre propaganda because it props up
[SPEAKER_00]: their own industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the urine testing people, the people
who are these counselors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world's plagued with counts of drug
abuse counselors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, I see marijuana addicts every
day in my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like the rape crisis council.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you see is rape victims all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, not everybody works the way you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just all see victims all day
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of us are out in the real world,
where we've got thousands of people with
[SPEAKER_00]: no dependency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't abuse people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not harmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the general public, you tend to meet
99% of the public knows how to conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 1% doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who these people see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the people who couldn't handle
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they end up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcoholic, heroin users, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, any guy who goes in and says,
I'm addicted to pot, he's really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for a rationalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're a fucking lazy son of a
bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop smoking pot and get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: End of story, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just fucking lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was lazy before he smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was lazy when he smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll be a lazy fuck after he quits
pot, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they blame pot because it's like
parents who, when they're teenagers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not my son anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hanging around with hippie chicks and
smoking pot and going to dissenting movies
[SPEAKER_00]: and rallies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's not the kid I took fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, well, what happens, he grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's on his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're blaming all the peripherals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be vegetarianism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be nudism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever he's doing that you don't know
that you didn't do, rather, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a symptom of his new way of living.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to blame that, not your son.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not changing or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not becoming an adult and making his
own mind up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the drugs or something like that,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the most common one with my mom was
blaming my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was such a nice boy until he started
going out with all those women.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed him, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is just a popular scapegoat for
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always laugh when I hear that because
invariably, it's some drug counselor guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've seen victims of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, what are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably a former alcoholic
yourself, isn't that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what are you doing with your
living?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you parlayed your alcoholism into a
career opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a cop, going around and
morally lecture people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't listen to you,
you crack their skull and you get paid for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you have the problem, but we're
made to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to lecture us about our
supposed problem, which nobody said we
[SPEAKER_00]: have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're clearly unable to handle
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a job as a counselor because
you've got lots of experience being a
[SPEAKER_00]: dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the world's full of people making
a paycheck on something wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd like to ask, is there any part
of Vancouver area that the weed refugees
[SPEAKER_02]: are moving to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you tend to be an East fan because
every third house is a grow-up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A South fan is a little more expensive and
a better place to be because it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: residential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, see, the problem is to have a
grow-up in a lot of places, you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: look like you're normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be sweet to your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to sort of hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be great if you had kids living
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bottom line is you tend not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The house tends to be all one big fucking
grow operation that you've rented out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't really want people coming
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit of an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately, be grateful we don't get
all the government we pay for,
[SPEAKER_00]: as Will Rogers said, because they'd have
more cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the cops can't keep up,
even if they bust someone every fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: day in the Lower Mainland, they certainly
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's peanuts they might get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in all of the Lower Mainland,
they get like 1,000 grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's at least 125,000 grow
operations in the whole Lower Mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like way beyond what they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll never catch them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they keep raising the threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if it's under 20 plants,
we can't bother with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's under 30 plants, we can't bother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now it's under like 100 plants,
we can't bother with it because we know
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of places that have more than 100
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stack them up and they keep
whittling them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the threshold keeps rising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the way to defeat this is
that more and more people have got to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about whether it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow more pot because you're forcing the
threshold up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a whole bunch of people start growing
25, 50 plants, then it's got to be under
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 plants or over to make it worth their
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's your own protection just by
forcing the numbers up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that pot out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're back to remind you that this
interview is brought to you by the
[SPEAKER_02]: Campaign for the Restoration and
Regulation of the Hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have an initiative out there that
we need your help on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act, which will
allow adults to grow their own marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will tax the sale of marijuana to
adults through state liquor stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed bars and taverns to sell
marijuana to adults, will allow doctors to
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribe marijuana to patients,
and allow farmers to cultivate industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp to produce paper, fabric,
protein, and oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to send you this petition,
so call us right now if you're registered
[SPEAKER_01]: to vote in Oregon or an Oregon resident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us at 503-235-4608.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, call us and we need your help
getting signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you already have the initiative and got
a couple of signatures on it, send it on
[SPEAKER_02]: back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need them soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: End of June is the drop dead deadline.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get enough signatures, get on a
ballot, get the pass, maybe we can start
[SPEAKER_02]: improving genetics here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Mark Emery set up in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up there now, they're part of the world's
leader in the genetic experiments on hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's where Oregon used to be and
we want to be back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can give us a call, put us on a
ballot, and it passes, we can be back in
[SPEAKER_02]: that boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about a real economic boom,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the tourist industry is going to
boom, the farmers are going to boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just tons of economic potential
here that we can channel with the Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of good, I think, the old
fashioned mom and pop businesses will come
[SPEAKER_02]: out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, you know, if we have
this regulated here in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can have stores, we can have cafes,
and a lot of small businesses will come
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it that people who don't want to
work for the big corporations or the
[SPEAKER_02]: government or whatever can actually get
behind this and, you know, make a money
[SPEAKER_02]: off it at the same time supporting the
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll raise hundreds of millions of
dollars in tax revenue for the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means less tax dollars that they'll
need from the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So help us with the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us right now to get our petition at
235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside the Portland area,
that's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're one of those people with access
to the internet, check out our website at
[SPEAKER_01]: http://www.crrh.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and check out the webpage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you call during business hours,
usually Bruce will be there to help you
[SPEAKER_02]: answer any questions all about the
initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not quite sure how to fill it
out, call us up and we'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we send you a package and a mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually have instructions, but
sometimes, you know, those aren't as clear
[SPEAKER_02]: as they should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you talk to a human, call us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and we'll be happy to walk you
through it and at least get your name on
[SPEAKER_02]: the initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can then go out and get one or
two of your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need everybody to get as many
signatures as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call 235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to cut back to this
wonderful interview with Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went up to Vancouver, British Columbia,
and spoke with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to admit that Mark Emory tells
it like it is and puts his opinions out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to that interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the Americans are always
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy up everything, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, well, what happens when
everybody's growing pot and we can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it'll never happen because it's
always America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And America has an endless appetite for
things that they shouldn't have,
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, America's just an endless
appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could never build enough casinos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could never have enough drugs for
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could never have enough marijuana for
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could never have enough French fries
for America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of things in America
you could never give them enough of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, America is just one endless
place to put pot when they'll always have
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of American money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because pot's a universal
commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's saleable everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, before prohibition, before
America made marijuana illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you could get pot in maybe three
or four places in the world, India,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan, Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was exported to the world from
there for the few people that wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was made illegal in Canada in
1923, there was no known record of
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody ever having smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever written about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever been recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's made any testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no evidence that it was ever grown
here from marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown for hemp all over the place,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody grew it for pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then they made it illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it grows in every village,
every hamlet, every city, every town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a guy growing north of the Arctic
Circle in Frobisher Bay with 2,000 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has an RCMP visit every three
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to take it all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole growth thing is timed cyclically
to match that RCMP visit so he can take it
[SPEAKER_00]: all down, put it away, put it back up when
he goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've got guys growing in the most
inhospitable environment on Earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as every other country,
nation, province, place on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing pot thanks to America's
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few plants in the Antarctic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, after all, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sun there would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be an excellent duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the ozone layer is deteriorating,
then you put that pot under there because
[SPEAKER_00]: it will thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will, of course, replace the ozone
layer that's lost by adding more carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide, sorry, more oxygen to the
environment and giving it an excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to grow under when you've got ozone
depletions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go endless amounts of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will begin to reverse the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nut pot grows everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every place in the world has pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every street on Vancouver has five to 25
grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops will tell you they can go down the
street and tell you about every third one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a grow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't even get the time to bust them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some rural areas around British
Columbia, they're not even doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called, so listen, your landlord says
you're growing pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have it done by tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you've got to rip it all out
and take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes by OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It maybe doesn't come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls it and says, did you rip it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he doesn't really want to bother
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, he knows it exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, that's actually
unconstitutional, because that constitutes
[SPEAKER_00]: a phishing expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just call me up at the phone book
and say, we know you've got pot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, one out of five people, Jesus
Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be kind of a good April Fools
joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Officer McGillicottie here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, it would be a sadistic April
Fools joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if they got Vista 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see who it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your ass is grass, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm surprised more of that doesn't
go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wonderful song by Sablon called
Oaks Crazy Fools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about putting a bullet in the
people that call 911 to turn us in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an interesting thing
worth considering to one degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, because there's nothing more evil
than someone in a so-called free society
[SPEAKER_00]: who would turn you in at the risk of going
to jail for five or 10 years over a
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should deal with those people harshly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have certainly no sympathy for
informers and people that drop dying and
[SPEAKER_00]: cause great untold misery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people should be dealt with harshly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly advocate a little private,
vigilante, American-style justice for
those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others involved in the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always amazed nobody with a rocket
launcher brings these helicopters down,
[SPEAKER_00]: as if you're not going to find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helicopter's coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be hours before they comb the air
and look for some guy with a rocket
[SPEAKER_00]: launcher in his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are all these militia guys when you
need them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck are you waiting for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They blow those fuckers out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all the arms and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell are we waiting for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a hero now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 million Americans will silently thank
your praises.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do you want out of living here?
[SPEAKER_00]: These military marshal guys, get in there
and raise some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take down what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US military.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big enough challenge for those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like Rambo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a tough guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all these weapons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, get to fucking work.
[SPEAKER_00]: America's out there and it needs to be
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting you guys with fertilizer bombs,
blowing up FBI headquarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea, originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's people and kids there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't have waited until there was a
big staff meeting or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, stupid mass justice seekers like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: America needs a training course on how to
properly execute government officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always edit this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the humorous outtakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the radical friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had helicopters over a humble
counter for 20 years and nobody's decided
[SPEAKER_00]: that they wanted to test out all that
surplus they brought back from NAMM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time I ever heard of them doing a
helicopter was in the Oregon coast range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were spraying herbicides for the
new forest to help the new trees grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was making people sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, of course, they had little grow
up in the woods at that time there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they actually blew up one helicopter
on a pad at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it nice and professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, there should be more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand what happened to proper
green revolutionaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have it like the IRA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have on one hand political guys like
us advocating in the public and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bunch of crazed guys who will blow
up anything government owned that's
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with that's attacking the
marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have them totally paranoid on
one hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could die at any moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other hand, you've got
smooth talkers like me trying to negotiate
[SPEAKER_00]: in the public realm with a little bit of
help from our armed buddies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nobody would be listening to that
Sheen Finn guy now if they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: blasting people's kneecaps the last 20
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people want to end that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the American government understands
they're in a war when they fight back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I notice you guys lose when you
have a determined opponent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else has kicked your ass lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately America's been really good on guys
like Iraq.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only brought into the 20th century about a
decade ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they lost again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking, I think in America
somebody that could be beaten because the
[SPEAKER_00]: rot from within is so extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm just giving you a hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're riffing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the outtake for your party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody said some funny things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's show you this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put that out there so those
radicals can take heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might lose your cable access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Emery is brought to you by the
Campaign for the Restoration and
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulation of Hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sponsors are the Oregon Cannabis Tax
Act, which is in Paul's hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will tax
and regulate the sale of marijuana to
[SPEAKER_01]: adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will allow adults to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will allow farmers to cultivate
marijuana for sales through liquor stores
[SPEAKER_01]: and bars and taverns.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also allow medical patients to
have access to marijuana at cost where
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana sold to adults will be taxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also allow farmers to cultivate
hemp for paper, fabric, protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: oil, and just tons of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a fabulous interview with
Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tells it like he sees it, doesn't he?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's just a visionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's had a lot of success up there in
Vancouver, BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's time for us here to put our
vision into action and give us a call at
[SPEAKER_02]: 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let us send you these petitions and
have you fill them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have petitions, they're already
filled out or with a few signatures,
[SPEAKER_02]: send them back as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: End of June is coming before you know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always one of those things like,
oh, gee, here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: July, I forgot to send them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that always happens every
campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sure hope we don't get calls in the
middle of July saying, oh, I had a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of thousand which would have put us over
the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, I didn't send them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please send them in today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our campaign to date has been
almost entirely volunteer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we are actually paying
petitioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need work or you know someone
who needs work, call us at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're paying petitioners now.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you want to help us as a
volunteer, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul and I are both volunteers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We donate our time and talents and money
to help this cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have to be reimbursed for
their expenses and their time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to be a paid petitioner,
call us right now at 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're a volunteer, call us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them back though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, definitely, you know, we need
volunteers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, who knows how long
before the money well dries up and we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't pay people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right now, you know,
we're fortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could pay a few folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we still need, we're probably
going to end up with a majority of our
[SPEAKER_02]: signatures being volunteer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the way it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't feel, don't think that's because
we're paying a few folks for the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need your one or two signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really, really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please give us a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send back petitions 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 503-235-4606.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what can I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Send the petitions back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them back in because we need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send them back right away,
we'll mail you new petitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got a new petition format.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dial that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: In closing, I'd like to say that if you
live in inner southeast Portland or inner
[SPEAKER_01]: northeast Portland and you're in house
district 14, I'm running as a Democrat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Democratic primary is on May 19th,
which is coming up any day now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are registered as a Democrat or
you're not registered with the party as an
[SPEAKER_01]: independent vote for me, D Paul Stanford
in the Democratic primary on May 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the Oregon cannabis tax.
