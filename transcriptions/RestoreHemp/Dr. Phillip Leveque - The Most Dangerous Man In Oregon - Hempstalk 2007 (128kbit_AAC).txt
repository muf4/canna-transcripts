[SPEAKER_01]: I was a battalion scout and point man and
any of you guys are veterans you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: the hell a point man means the life
expectancy is about 30 minutes or so
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that and I was in a war
history writing class with about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: Vietnam guys and I told them that I was a
point man and scout they says oh no you
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't and I says god damn it yes I was
and he's nah you weren't if you were you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be dead so here I am mean as hell and so
forth how many of you read the story in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Oregonian last week about the DEA
trying to get hold of your patients charts
[SPEAKER_01]: how many of you raise your hands you read
that well let me tell you the DEA skunks
[SPEAKER_01]: and the local cops are all going crazy
because you bastards have permits to use
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and you have permits to grow it
and you have permits to carry it you have
[SPEAKER_01]: permits to give it to somebody else and
all that kind of stuff and there are
[SPEAKER_01]: 15,000 of you guys with permits right now
15,000 in Oregon and about 7,000 caregiver
[SPEAKER_01]: growers so that makes about 22,000 people
who have the permits right now now this is
[SPEAKER_01]: this is small potatoes because in
California there are over 300,000 people
[SPEAKER_01]: who have permits well California
understand is a little bit larger than
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon you you don't mind if I say Oregon
do you you know well I lived this east of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mississippi for about 20 years or so
and back there I was from Oregon and that
[SPEAKER_01]: used to grate on my nerves and so I
finally figured out thank God they've
[SPEAKER_01]: never been out here because if they ever
say that in the state of Oregon they get
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody hit him over the head of the
brick yeah thank you sir or madam when the
[SPEAKER_01]: board took away my license in November
three years ago I was really disgusted
[SPEAKER_01]: with this because they thought that they
were punishing me they were not punishing
[SPEAKER_01]: me they were they were punishing my 4,000
patients and and I I got the idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were trying to stop the medical
marijuana program but as most of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC foundation clinic is probably
seeing about 200 patients a week and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing the number of patients all the
time
[SPEAKER_01]: there are 2,200 doctors in Oregon now who
are signing applications 2,200 of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of you know many of you don't know
I'm actually an osteopathic doctor and
[SPEAKER_01]: believe it or not there are 200
osteopathic doctors who are signing these
[SPEAKER_01]: applications and I thought I would I was
the only one and because I thought I was
[SPEAKER_01]: the only one I was a real bad person and
that's one of the reasons why I'm wearing
[SPEAKER_01]: this cute thing right here that I'm the
most dangerous man in Oregon because it
[SPEAKER_01]: said so in the Oregonian that reminds me
thank you very much that reminds me of
[SPEAKER_01]: several years ago on our television
program a man phoned up and wanted to know
[SPEAKER_01]: if his medical condition would permit him
to get a a permit and so forth and and so
[SPEAKER_01]: he told me what his medical condition was
I just hell yes I said you're eligible
[SPEAKER_01]: come on to the office and he says dr.
Leveque I'd like to have a relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: with you and I said if you don't mind
please don't say that on television so I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope you two guys don't want to have a
relationship with me because I I gave all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff up I I was a Boy Scout till I
was 14 and then I became a Girl Scout I
[SPEAKER_01]: have just started writing articles about
medical marijuana the website is called
[SPEAKER_01]: Salem-news.com and I try to write at least
one article a week about all the sundry
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of medical marijuana what we're
concentrating on right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: post-traumatic stress disorder how many
vets I got in the office here you poor
[SPEAKER_01]: dumb bastards don't volunteer for shit
that's all I have to say at any rate even
[SPEAKER_01]: the Veterans Administration admits that
they are failing to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: post-traumatic stress patients which which
is a real surprise because I was in the VA
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital about 50 years ago and they told
my mother on three occasions that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: believe your son's gonna make it and I
fooled them and I survived and then about
[SPEAKER_01]: two years later I met one of my doctors in
the hallway of the medical school and he
[SPEAKER_01]: looks me up and down he says you're
Leveque aren't you and I said yeah I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: little effect he says well are you a
janitor here and I says no I'm a PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate he says really I says what do
you mean really he says we never thought
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd be normal again so if any of you
think that I'm normal you're crazier than
[SPEAKER_01]: hell now does it do any of you have any
questions of any something or other I have
[SPEAKER_01]: I have become one of the world's
authorities on medical marijuana so ask me
[SPEAKER_01]: any thing how do I qualify for to get a
card oh okay how bashful are you come up
[SPEAKER_01]: here and talk to me come on get up here
[SPEAKER_01]: oh very actually hey that's a very good
question in fact of the matter is over
[SPEAKER_01]: this past week I wrote two articles about
ADD and ADHD and the California doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: hold my microphone by whose mouth my mouth
oh okay the doctors in California and as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as I know there are about 70 doctors
in California who are writing these
[SPEAKER_01]: permits but just like I say they have
written over 300,000 by now and the DEA
[SPEAKER_01]: and the local cops are going crazy down
there because well what the hell you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just a bunch of potheads and you don't
deserve even the time of day so ADD and
[SPEAKER_01]: ADHD are good now I was invited back to a
to a subcommittee at Congress three years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago by representative Sauder from Indiana
and he represented Eli Lillian company in
[SPEAKER_01]: Indianapolis who had just developed a new
ADD ADHD drug and so what Sauder wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: do was to quash the medical marijuana in
the United States completely and so I was
[SPEAKER_01]: invited back there and I was told by the
marijuana policy project that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to skin me alive so I decided not to
go but the strain now that it Eli Lilly
[SPEAKER_01]: company figured that the ADD drug would
bring in a billion dollars a year but
[SPEAKER_01]: after it was released and used for about
six months they found out it didn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: now this is really crazy because marijuana
does work for kids and and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke but they eat it in cookies how many
of you are cookie eaters how many of you
[SPEAKER_01]: are smokers I don't know why the hell I
asked that no no I don't I don't well
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not exactly true about six years
ago my youngest son gave me a loaded bomb
[SPEAKER_01]: for Christmas and he says I'll dare you to
light it up
[SPEAKER_01]: well I think it was pretty bad grass or
some goddamn thing probably Mexican mud
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows something like that but in your
end I took a couple hits off and I says
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus Christ what what's what's so great
about this stuff he said well you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: taking enough of it how many of you have
heard that
[SPEAKER_01]: how many of you ever been high how many of
you been high twice
[SPEAKER_01]: what you say how many guys have been high
37 years straight I think this is
[SPEAKER_01]: hilarious well I will say I will say that
when I became a graduate student at the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical school the first thing the
chairman says LeVac go into the stockroom
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if you can straighten it out so I
went into the stockroom and the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I found was a gallon jug of
cannabis cough medicine this was 13 years
[SPEAKER_01]: after it was declared illegal for anybody
in the United States to have anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that and I said well it was made by Park
Davis and company which is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest in the world and I poured myself a
pint and I took it home and I tried it out
[SPEAKER_01]: and it works and so I still have that
point someplace around my house and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: find it one of these days but that was the
only time that I actually smoked marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time but I have used the tincture
and I've used the oil and they work fine
[SPEAKER_01]: for me and how many of you ever had bad
grass did you like it raise your hand if
[SPEAKER_01]: you enjoyed it didn't like it well it's
great that in British Columbia they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing some of the best grass in the
world and some of the plants are being
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in the Portland area you probably
know that how many of you know that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know that very good what do you want this
guy says he's gonna cut my throat so does
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody have any final question here to
ask me don't get smart with me fella glad
[SPEAKER_01]: to be here I'm gonna turn around and give
you all a very short very short picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis therapeutics take a look at it
isn't that more fun than it ought to be
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you very much do not smoke in the
rain
