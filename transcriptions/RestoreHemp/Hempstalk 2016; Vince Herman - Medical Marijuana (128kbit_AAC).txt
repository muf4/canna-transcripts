[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just got my medical card
renewed just this past week and found out
[SPEAKER_00]: that my doctor is losing his medical
license because the Oregon State Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: Board decided that he was writing too many
prescriptions for this ganja stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine they might have been getting
a little pressured from the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, which is losing money to this
dang ganja prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it awful?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're going to win in the
long run, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, here's a great
doctor, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not allowed to practice medicine next
week because he's fighting a battle that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all fighting, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep up the good work, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up for the folks who put on this
fest and keep it in people's mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland's a great town to do it in,
I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
