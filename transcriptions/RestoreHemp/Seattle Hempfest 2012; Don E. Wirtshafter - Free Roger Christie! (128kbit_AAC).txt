[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, today I choose to speak up for my
friend Roger Christie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody know about Roger?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my third HempFest to come here and
try to speak for Roger Christie and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to talk about anything else
because my friend has been in jail for
[SPEAKER_00]: over two years without bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, two years on a pot charge and
they're not even allowing him to put up
[SPEAKER_00]: bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an honorably discharged U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: soldier, you know, fought in our armed
forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has never been in any criminal trouble
in his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nonviolent crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing about harm to the public
other than the fact that my friend Roger
[SPEAKER_00]: Christie had the courage to post a sign on
the front of his building in Hilo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sign said, we smoke pot religiously
and so can you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this sign was on the front of the
building right next to the sign for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chamber of Commerce of Hilo, Hawaii and he
was there for almost 10 years with his
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian cannabis ministry and he was open
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ran for mayor, he ran for governor,
he went to every public hearing and his
[SPEAKER_00]: message consistently was we got a real
problem in Hawaii and it isn't pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at this study I found that says
if we just let people have pot they won't
[SPEAKER_00]: use meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a minister.
[SPEAKER_00]: He picked up these religious mantles and
he carried it forward and he helped a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of people in his religious
ministry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided that it was important for
him to defend his rights to use cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: as a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important that in the year 2003 he sued
the federal government to establish his
[SPEAKER_00]: rights to religious freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the federal government fought the
lawsuit not by saying you don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: right but by saying hey we're not going to
investigate you, he's not under
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation, there's no threat of
federal prosecution, he doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: case, he has no standing, you have to
throw his case out of court.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the federal courts did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that same federal government that
said they weren't investigating Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christie and they weren't going to
prosecute him then sent in the narcs big
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent two years investigating the
small little religious cult in Hilo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii that was operating openly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did everything possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years of video surveillance,
two years of narcs coming in the church
[SPEAKER_00]: and invading the privacy of the religious
context here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years of wiretaps, 17,000 phone calls,
most of them people thinking they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to their minister with the
government listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happened to Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day they came in and they arrested not
just Roger but 12 of his friends including
[SPEAKER_00]: his fiancee Cher and some people who were
growing for the church, you know just
[SPEAKER_00]: people who attended the church.
[SPEAKER_00]: 13, we have the Hawaii 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was July 8th, two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everyone else got Bond but Roger he's
too much of a danger to the community to
[SPEAKER_00]: release on Bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: See they put all these charges together
and they combine them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all responsible for each other's
plants and they get it over a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and Roger's potentially might get
10 years in jail and that changes the Bond
[SPEAKER_00]: laws now that we have the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that they can keep him
without Bond and without any promise of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gentle person who's never hurt a
soul, who's fought for our country,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's ministered to thousands,
he's too dangerous to let out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our modern day drug war where we
are the fodder in this war and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting trampled in this war.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you think, no matter how
free we are here, we have brothers and
[SPEAKER_00]: sisters suffering with life sentences with
20 years plus life sentences with billion
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar forfeitures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people losing their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got people losing their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got people losing their health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to do something here everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right so this is HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come out to celebrate how well we are
doing here and we are doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we came to HempFest 15 years ago you
had to keep looking over your shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to look for all the policemen
coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boats out there with binoculars
looking for people smoking on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The van they kept out here to arrest
people and arresting over a hundred people
[SPEAKER_00]: a weekend for just smoking here in the
park.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we continued HempFest because it was
our civil disobedience that we were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to change the laws with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 10 years, 15 years that we've been
doing this, it's at the worst of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have made these policemen understand
one by one that we're not dangerous and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not crazy and we're assets to their
community and they best work with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're able to do this
HempFest without anybody in here running
[SPEAKER_00]: around looking for what we're doing
because we've kept it safe and we've kept
[SPEAKER_00]: it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's the final message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it clean everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick up these scraps of paper,
cigarette butts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all got to come up before tomorrow
morning because we got a big party to give
[SPEAKER_00]: here tomorrow and the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love you HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to all the thousands of
volunteers that make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for each and every one of you
who puts your money in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Vivian.
