[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful day out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I love about Portland is you
can have a cigarette outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to a sidewalk cafe and have a
beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I hate about Portland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pot's legal, but you can't smoke it
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know if you know this,
but in addition to my activism work,
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially I work with the Northwest
Cannabis Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right down here on Powell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I got some members out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right on Powell here by the Aladdin
Theater, 13th and Powell, open seven days
[SPEAKER_00]: a week from noon to midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a place where anyone 21 and older,
whether you're medical or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: can come in and socialize and enjoy your
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can vape in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got vape rigs for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my work, what I found is I talk to
people and I find out, well, why are you
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to the club?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't you at home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't you hanging out in your own
space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents don't want to smoke pot around
their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like a bar or a cigar bar,
they need a place to go socialize away
[SPEAKER_00]: from their minor children because they're
responsible parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other people that come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the housing situation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that are literally living in
trailers and come into our nice club
[SPEAKER_00]: because they want to entertain their
guests and they want to socialize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, the days of reefer
madness are going away, but unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: we need more people in the state house so
it goes away more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act is the
method that they're using to regulate us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to say that there can be no
smoke anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we're supposed to be free
to associate with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's legal for me to smoke a joint at
home, why shouldn't it be legal for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a club socially somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only one voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see a lot of voices out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the thing that I want you to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're already registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what laws you want there to be in
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know who represents you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either locally or in the state house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever contacted them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen them at a public
gathering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seen them out at the county fair where
they're eating hot dogs, whatever they got
[SPEAKER_00]: going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been to their offices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you written an email or made a phone
call?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that all the
individual voices can do to effect change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's money at play in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's money in keeping it illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of fines that go
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, you know, if you smoke out in
public, you can get a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the court system,
it's just a grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to create safe access where
adults can meet and greet and entertain
[SPEAKER_00]: each other responsibly and socially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not be, feel like criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't have to hide in a closet
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get the chance, come on down
to 13th and Powell and see us down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily from noon to midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy on the first and third,
Thursdays of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Medicaid on Monday, every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Treats Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pack that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pack the patio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a beautiful facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not sitting on the couch at Dave's
Garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come on by, but talk to your
legislators and tell them what the law
[SPEAKER_00]: should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next session, it's going to be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Portland.
