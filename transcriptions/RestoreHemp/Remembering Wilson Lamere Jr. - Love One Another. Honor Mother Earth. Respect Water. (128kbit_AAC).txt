[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of freedom fighters out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're fighting for human rights to
make this world a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank my brother here, Jim Mathison.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go back a long ways and we've always
fought for human rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe in this medicine, this
marijuana is a great medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it heals all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only one thing that we ask
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's real easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honor Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respect water because without water
there's no life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to all my relations here, I thank you
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful day and it's a beautiful
weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful people here and all the
people that work so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he said, he picks up every piece of
paper, every cigarette butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you people can help pick up a little
bit of garbage before you leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really helps the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it once again, like I said,
once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: To all my relations, I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Happy.
When is my brother going to be free?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to make
a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dance for unity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dance for Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you will join me out in the circle,
my brother's going to sing a song in honor
[SPEAKER_01]: of everyone that's here and have a safe
trip home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you find everything like you
left it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to all my relations, God bless you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, oh, hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, oh, hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, oh, hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, oh, hey.
