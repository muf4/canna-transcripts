[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so good to be here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time I have been able to
be at a march here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually up in Seattle, so thank you
guys very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Voices of the Cannabis War.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also am a host for K-Boo's Prison
Pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: K-Boo does that Mondays at 630,
and Voices of the Cannabis War is 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: on Sunday mornings on Block Talk Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today to talk for people who
can't be here to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of which is Kristen Floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kristen is one of my wonderful dear
friends, and she was supposed to be here
[SPEAKER_00]: today to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family emergency, and she can't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have the opportunity to give you
good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kristen, if you don't know,
her father died in federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was shackled to a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had been in for four months of his
sentence when he died there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first caregiver in Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of you out here who are dispensary
owners, caregivers, recreational growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: federally, you're still at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And families like Kristen suffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her dad died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her mom also went to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Williams is still in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is this last week,
Sherry Floor was standing on stage in
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle for their march.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has now been about two weeks,
and she can finally have her medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will never get her husband back.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in prison when he died.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't there for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's finally getting some of her
freedom back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when people get out of prison,
they're not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have a record.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still struggle to get jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them are still on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't even have all of their rights
back when they first get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of them are still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people tell me, oh, Mindy,
they're not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't go to prison for weed
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooper Corvain, he got life sentenced two
years ago out of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys here, I have letters asking the
president to let these guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: President Obama has been letting people
out left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hearing about it all over the
news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can count on less than two hands
how many of them are out there for pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are lots of other things,
and I'm grateful for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not our weed prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antonio Bescarro, where is he?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longest serving prisoner for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he's in for almost 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got an 80-year sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuban war hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: His daughter wants him home desperately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Free, again, he wasn't even in the
state that they accused him of at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these guys are in for conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even have weed on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please come to my booth over there,
sign some letters, get the president to
[SPEAKER_00]: send them home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to urge you, don't get
complacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not done in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot smoke pot in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a renter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could still get drug tested at my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still people who are losing
things, as well as we cannot go to
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must deschedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule two is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
