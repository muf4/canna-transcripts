[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who here believes that everybody should
have access to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter your political affiliation,
no matter your race, no matter your
[SPEAKER_00]: ethnicity, no matter how old you are,
no matter how young you are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody should have access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now who thinks everyone should have access
to the best cannabis in the world like
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Portland?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is without a doubt the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've traveled all around the world and
Portland has the best cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was in the South, when I was in
the Southern USA, we don't have laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: are quite as liberal as they are here in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father spent seven years in prison for
an ounce of cannabis before he was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into the top college in North
Carolina and ended up having to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: and become a janitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year he worked up with our
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved to another city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I finally got a chance to have
cannabis, when I finally got a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience it, I ended up getting arrested
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was arrested a total of four times for
cannabis possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time even for a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was arrested and spent two nights in
prison, two nights in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily I never got a chance to go to
prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people in our community and
communities that have been highly impacted
[SPEAKER_00]: by cannabis prohibition are very bitter,
kind of look at the cannabis industry as
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is not for them,
something that will not help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that everyone having
access to the best cannabis is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I finally got a chance to move to
Portland and finally got a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume cannabis without getting arrested,
I wanted to learn more about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to learn more about the industry
and it was the people of Portland that
[SPEAKER_00]: opened up their doors, opened up their
grow rooms, opened up their grow shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: their knowledge to teach me how to grow
the best cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started Lyle Cannabis here in
Portland, Oregon, contributing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd cannabis story here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in the cannabis industry,
if you're benefiting from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, you cannot do it without
understanding the history of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot do it without contributing to
the people who have paid that sacrifice
[SPEAKER_00]: and have opened up for legalization to
actually happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never thought legalization was a real
thing in the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never thought it could happen,
but it's here and it's here because of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each and every one of us, no matter
whether you're going to a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter whether you're contributing and
buying from your local grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to find a way to help alleviate
some of the issues that have been caused
[SPEAKER_00]: through cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way to do that is to work with the
New Leaf Project here in Portland,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland was the first city in the
country, I want to say that one more time,
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland was the first city in the country
to open up some of this cannabis tax to
[SPEAKER_00]: help people who have been targeted by
cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to think about how monumental that
is for a city to open up and become the
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happening all across the country
because of what Portland has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of that, organizations
like the New Leaf Project that my wife
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeanette Ward is running and I'm helping
with, and so many other Portland citizens
[SPEAKER_00]: are supporting, is opening up and helping
with expungement opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping to give grants to black-owned
and minority-owned candidates and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping to contribute to that history
and alleviate that history that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: caused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a long way to go without a
doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot that we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want everybody here to think
about as I leave the stage here is how am
[SPEAKER_00]: I going to contribute to helping these
issues that have been caused by cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to support the dispensary that
is helping to make these movements like
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Hop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to help support the cannabis
companies that are helping to contribute?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to help by just helping the
everyday Portland citizens out here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: street every day by giving them a joint,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it may be, how can you help
everybody here through the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization movement?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank all the Portland
citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not be in this cannabis industry
without this amazing city and without the
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing fighters here in Oregon that help
to open up legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much everyone here who
has helped with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you everyone who will contribute
to making a better cannabis legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: picture in the state of Oregon.
Thank you.
