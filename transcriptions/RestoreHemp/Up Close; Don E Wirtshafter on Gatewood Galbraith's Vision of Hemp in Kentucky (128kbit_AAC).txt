who can you think of a dead world
or some currency?
What did guten destruction look like,
and maybe they had noks?
Like a grand bonertask, respects US,
or a wild-rocketing US MERGAS of the US.
The dead world is too far away.
There's this cab you may have on the clock
to a cell in US.
It's too far away, right you just have
here, we have this blue thing in the front
We just about to talk about the rest of
the issue.
I think one of the most interesting issues
of all is the political issues.
It is very well-represented, we are not
polarized in the way we are, we are not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the political interests, but somehow,
the policies are post-crisis.
So we're talking about political issue.
They decided not well, they're most
politically correct, politically correct,
politically correct, in the political
issue.
There's a lot of spokesmen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're talking about and they're both
diffusing the people's pictures and
they're all of which can affect this
world.
This is what we try to do is to go around
and simulate a person that we are.
We're thinking we're going to have some
idea of the potential of the world in
which we're going to use this time that
this is not the end of the world,
we're going to end it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making an idea, making an idea,
we're just going to stick to the idea of
how we're going to
create a new state.
I'm not done with that, don't want to
spend more time on this, I'm not done with
that, don't want to spend more time on
this, don't want to spend more time on
this.
I'm not done with that, don't want to
spend more time on this, I'm not done with
that, don't want to spend more time on
this.
I'm done with that, don't want to spend
more time on this, I'm not done with that,
don't want to spend more time on this.
I'm done with that, don't want to spend
more time on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done with that, don't want to spend
more time on this.
