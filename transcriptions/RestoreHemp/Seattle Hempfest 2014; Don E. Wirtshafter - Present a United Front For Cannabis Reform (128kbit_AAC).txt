[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm Donnie Workshafter, and I have
the distinction of selling the first hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: fest 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's first hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I've been in the hemp
industry, in the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, and I've been attorney for many
of the companies that sell their wares
[SPEAKER_00]: here through the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gotta say how proud I am of Seattle,
how proud I am of the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: For pulling this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when we would come to hemp fest
and they would have the vans, the police
[SPEAKER_00]: vans there, the headquarters vans and the
paddy wagon vans, all ready to arrest
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of us for protesting the
legalization of marijuana in this park.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fairly brutal with us,
I thought, you know, considering it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: protest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of us chose to risk our careers,
to risk whatever, to do the civil protest
[SPEAKER_00]: that became hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through the years, we organized and we
educated ourselves enough that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: pass a proposition that made marijuana
enforcement the lowest priority in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a lot of people against
this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, if they legalized marijuana,
it's gonna make people drink and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna drink and they're gonna be
high and we're gonna have traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: accidents and it's gonna be all kinds of
dead people and all these things that they
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I wanna know today is,
one or two years after we have full
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, after it's perfectly legal
for us to do this thing, where are the
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these dire predictions of what was
gonna happen to our society if we simply
[SPEAKER_00]: taxed and regulated marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the harms?
[SPEAKER_00]: The state's making money, some people
favored by the state are making money,
[SPEAKER_00]: other people not favored by the state are
losing their shirts, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's how business works.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it's a business now and not an
underground empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm really proud of the way that
Seattle has led the world on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The activism of Seattle Home Fest
succeeded in bringing about this miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have here that the whole world is
watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's my caution, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Elster in me trying to say,
please don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can blow all this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it once before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just about won this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This issue in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But stupid excess and some really hard
work on the part of the right torpedoed
[SPEAKER_00]: all these efforts and 40 years later,
we're still fighting the same battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my message to you is, don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it in their faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make people mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cause a backlash that's gonna take
these incredible reforms we have away from
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my other caution to the world of
Seattle, of Washington, is all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: medical users, this whole thing was built
on the medical users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we seem to be tromping over the
medical users in favor of commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people make a whole lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really urge everybody to get
together and work together and not fight,
[SPEAKER_00]: not battle like we did this last
legislative session.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can win anything we want from the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislature understands that 80% of
the people are in favor of marijuana or
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana or whatever their
definition is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we don't present a united front,
that 20% is gonna win and we're gonna end
[SPEAKER_00]: up with an even more ridiculous set of
regulations and rules and laws than we
[SPEAKER_00]: have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for coming down to have
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody please kick in those buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
