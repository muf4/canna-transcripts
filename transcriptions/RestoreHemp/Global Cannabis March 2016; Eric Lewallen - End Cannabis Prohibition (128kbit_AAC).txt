[SPEAKER_00]: How we doing out there today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we all ready to march?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's talk about what today is
all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, serious minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is about making it legal for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just us here in Oregon that have
already legalized it, not just Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the other ones who've already got
it legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it legalized globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is the day when we all get
together and we march as one unison to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this plant legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's my other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical marijuana project here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need it for medical reasons,
if you need it to make your daily life
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, we're in jeopardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all may not see it, but we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking it from us day by day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minute by minute, we're losing everything
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all feel safe with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to pay these rising prices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel that you should have to pay
for your medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay for life?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, everybody should have the right to
have life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The freedom of the journey to live is what
we're here for, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm one of those that like to make it
short and sweet because that's how I do my
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put our hands together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's route it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's enjoy this march for everybody
that deserves the right to enjoy a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: called cannabis, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Portland, Oregon, let's line up when
it's time and let's march for our freedom
[SPEAKER_00]: of life, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, here, Portland, Oregon.
