[SPEAKER_00]: Howdy folks, thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't have had better weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, as has been mentioned
several times, we said in Measure 91 that
[SPEAKER_00]: it would not affect medical marijuana
three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the history of the legislature,
they have never taken a law passed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: people and changed it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only time the legislature has
to date said, oh, the people didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually mean what we passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and not only did they change the
law, they declared an emergency,
[SPEAKER_00]: a legislative emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't referendum on the changes
that were made because it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: legislative emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people of the state support this
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, marijuana should be cheap and
plentiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows on trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is everything that's been
said about it is a law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, as many of you probably heard me say
ad nauseam, it's the oldest crop
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated over 12,000 years, maybe over
25,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the most productive crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces more fuel, more fiber,
more food and more medicine than any other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have co-evolved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole deal to prohibit it has always
been about money and power and the
[SPEAKER_00]: centralization of economic and political
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
military, industrial, transnational,
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate, elite, fascist sons of bitches
don't want us to have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it's all about,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sooner we can end these stupid
overregulations and free cannabis so our
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers can grow it without regard to its
THC content, but according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that make the best and most
fuel, fiber, food and medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the whole economy of this world will
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of seeing the centralization of
economic control, we'll see the
[SPEAKER_00]: decentralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis regulations are overly specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be allowed to be cultivated with
less regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this isn't alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one dies from this the way they die
from alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need realistic regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way to do that is to educate our
lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think, you know, a lot of them
believe the lies that we've been told all
[SPEAKER_00]: our lives by these economic forces to
benefit the few.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our job to educate these folks that
this is the oldest crop, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: productive crop, and it can change the
whole world if they'll allow it to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sooner, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon can be on the cutting edge of
exciting new economic and ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: change if our legislature will get out of
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please get in there, tell your
legislators, are there offices that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis doesn't deserve to be regulated
like alcohol because it's a lot safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my honor to be here and restore
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one, Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
