[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Rick Steves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels good to come out of the
closet, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it a strange sort of concept that we
have to come out of the concept about
[SPEAKER_00]: something that just feels like a very
basic civil liberty?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've heard all of the talking
points and so on from the main stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought this is for the eager
students here at Hemposium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to give you a little
background on my experience in speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: out on this issue in public, not at
Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to talk about it here,
but it's tougher to talk about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at your parent-teacher
association meetings or with your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: down the street or at the supermarket or
something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also had some interesting challenge
to try to understand the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: better, respect the other side,
understand what motivates them because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think it's good citizenship
all around and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness-raising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enlightening people, sharing other
people's challenges and how they've
[SPEAKER_00]: succeeded and what they've learned where
we can move forward on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little while ago, I had dinner with Gil
Karolkowski's sort of lead narcotics guy
[SPEAKER_00]: in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful man, beautiful guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, him and I kind of clicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't realize it, but Karolkowski
had sent him out to listen to me give my
[SPEAKER_00]: talks around the Puget Sound area just to
see what Hempfest kind of people were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sat down with him and we had a great
dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He disagreed with everything I said except
my contention that you can make a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good case that the mature adult use of
marijuana is a civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said, you've got to cover the other
bases, driving, access to kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction, abuse, education, all this kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very interesting, it's a very
interesting sort of challenge that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me after that dinner,
he said, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you're some, you know,
well-off white guy in the suburbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could smoke pot, no problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can invite your friends over and have
a great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you in this fight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most of us can smoke with
discretion and be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there really is a matter of principle
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought about it and I thought,
I am really into travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm a travel writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent a third of my adult life just
traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love going places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, high is a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really treasure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I want to go there, I want to go
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need my government to give me a
passport for that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are cases when our government
can tell us we can't go there for various
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons and we've got to live with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can argue about Cuba,
but you can't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there's reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to high, I just don't think
there's a good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they've got wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got reasons based on fear and lies
and what's going to get them elected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no real honest reason why we
cannot go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have thought about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, basically a lot of us just
like to smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my friends, most of my business
associates, you know, if you locked up
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in our community that likes to
smoke pot recreationally, it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: major blow to our communities,
to our businesses and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just sort of my theme that the
mature adult recreational consumption of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is a civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to mince around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to dance around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to say that really clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, of course, medical marijuana is a
very serious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My passion is this civil liberties thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm working closely with the
ACLU.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been my theme as a board member
with normal for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, our challenge is how do we
protect this civil liberty and at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time deal with the downside of pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have all sorts of ideals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, initiative 505 has got great
ideals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect their idealism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I live in a reality out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a reality where 800,000
Americans were arrested last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't rich white guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were poor people and people of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're people for the rest of their
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have a cross to bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be at a further
disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just flat out wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the irony is people who make that law
are afraid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that law, they've got more
to be afraid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reached a point in our society where
if we lock up any more people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to get more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You take nonviolent people who got in
trouble for some experimental drug use,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been to finishing school and they
can't get a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to become part of that
criminal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take ideas like this and mess
up otherwise polite dinners and challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: people to say, where are you getting your
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you really know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many exciting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been at this for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've learned these exciting points
that you can just inject into
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you distill it down to a bumper
sticker, it's going to be hard on drugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: soft on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get enough of an attention
span so we can educate people about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it on commercial television
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it on public television.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do a pledge drive right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just spent an hour at KCTS with The
Weekly with a wonderful panel of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that are co-sponsoring these
initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really got some great information
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a trick to get that information
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced a half hour video with the
ACLU.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: A marijuana time for discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love that thing because it raises
awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so proud to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote that very carefully with all the
legalistic sensitivity so that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: buy time to put it on Cairo or Como or
King.
[SPEAKER_00]: We paid them money to produce it in their
studios.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a thymaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay the money, you can put it on
TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they wouldn't let us air that show
except once after Girls Gone Wild at about
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just like evil information
because it challenges this status quo with
[SPEAKER_00]: a thoughtful, reasonable harm reduction
approach to marijuana drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to this, how are we going to
make it clear that this is a civil
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty, which my friend on the other side
said is a very strong argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to deal with the political
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not promoting the use of a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're promoting the right to use it if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never promoted marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really careful about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promote the use of it as a civil
liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people understandably need to hear
us say that drugs can be abused to
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledge it is a problem in our
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an educational component to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That drinking and smoking and then driving
while intoxicated is not an issue that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can wish away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idealists in 505 Camp, you know,
again, I wish we could sell the 505
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to put out an initiative that
can be embraced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everywhere you talk outside of
ChemFest, parents in the suburbs don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want their kid hit by somebody who is high
on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have enough scientific
evidence now to deal with it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get something where we can have
some funds and a drug that can be tested
[SPEAKER_00]: by human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spent a day up at a pharmaceutical
convention up in the past ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a bunch of doctors and
pharmacists and scientists and professors
[SPEAKER_00]: all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topic was the pharmaceutical nature of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like 300 very highly trained
medical specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could not, the only evidence they
were using was evidence of the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana on rats and hamsters because it
was illegal and they couldn't use evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't acknowledge even that people
would use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, I mean, there's that kind of a
disconnect right now between science and
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable science and the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just said, you know, you don't need
to get this hamster high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just go across the street and
talk to somebody and ask them what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got this drinking and driving
concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the whole fear of children and
getting their hands on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has got to be addressed and it's
got to be addressed smartly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an issue that is near and dear
to any parent's hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often wonder why our generation didn't
just grow into power and marijuana would
[SPEAKER_00]: become regulated and taxed and like
alcohol and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we became parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worry about our kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are victimized by a lot of
government sponsored We For Madness kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of propaganda that twists the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tell us it's 20 times as strong
as it was when we were kids or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: and this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to kind of talk a little bit
about this sort of information,
[SPEAKER_00]: this angle on the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give you just sort of my
take on it as a traveler and a travel
[SPEAKER_00]: writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring a European sort of sensibility,
I think, to the whole discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, I spend a lot of time
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write guidebooks about Europe and make
this TV show and public television and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so interesting to me how America
brags about how we are the land of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pursuit of happiness and, you know,
live life with gusto and everything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you travel a lot, you come home
and there's a sort of a culture shock and
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse and you realize we are really
quite an uptight society in a lot of ways
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to Europeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've taken groups to spas in
Germany where everybody just kind of gets
[SPEAKER_00]: naked and relaxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my people won't even go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just so afraid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I produce my TV show, if it has any
nudity on it, it won't be aired in the
[SPEAKER_00]: more conservative parts of our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: My show, which you've probably seen on
Channel 9, actually has to be aired after
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 o'clock in parts of our country because
we show 500 year old marble penises.
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 year old canvas nudes, breasts,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a law that terrorizes stations
into shielding people's eyes from this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of end of our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you travel, you realize there are
different ways to address these sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: edgy issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in the United States,
I think we are sort of fearful and driven
[SPEAKER_00]: into sort of a compliance with what we
think is the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these sort of uptight areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, the whole thing about
marijuana is just one lie too many,
[SPEAKER_00]: one bit of uptightness too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when I go to Europe for my
friends over there, a joint is about as
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting as a can of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's very,
very clear that we've got this prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: on marijuana that is something that is
very costly to our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to other societies,
they care about drug abuse and drug
[SPEAKER_00]: related problems just as much as we do,
but they approach it in a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: progressive and pragmatic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I speak out, you know, from that
perspective, when I, part of my work as a
[SPEAKER_00]: traveler is to get people out of their
comfort zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a fundamental thing about
travel is you hang out with people who
[SPEAKER_00]: find different truths to be self-evident
and God-given.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at something that used to be
scary and then you get to know the person
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whirling dervish, I mean, looks kind of
freaky to a lot of Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you talk to the guy and you find
out what he's thinking when he's whirling
[SPEAKER_00]: around, it becomes a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a very beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, foie gras, a lot of people are
all tight about foie gras because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to force feed the geese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can go to a goose farm in France
and learn a little bit about the situation
[SPEAKER_00]: and it becomes quite a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so much fun in my TV show of trying
to expose people to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to Iran, very frightening place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was afraid before I went to Iran,
got there and I realized they're just as
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid of us as we are of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we just meet each other,
all of a sudden it becomes much sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: more potential to get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I've just got something in my
nature to try to get people out of their
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a constructive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when my boy was about three
years old and we were having, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: saying thank you for table grace and
invite grandma and grandpa over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach my son at the end of the prayer to
go, Allah, Allah, Allah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just freaks out my dad,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get people out of their comfort
zones when we travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a good thing to get
people out of their comfort zones here
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, Hemfest, for a lot of
people, is out of their comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be great if a lot of people
who don't know anything about this issue
[SPEAKER_00]: could come here and just feel this mellow
vibe and see the police and the mayor of
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle yesterday on stage and see this
kind of commitment to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just fun and civil liberties and
compassionate medical use and pragmatic
[SPEAKER_00]: harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a fun challenge for all of us
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the whole marijuana
thing, when you go to Europe, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: paint a broad stroke here because it's
easy to say Europe's this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the fact is there's 20 different
countries and they all have different
[SPEAKER_00]: rules on this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are more regressive than we
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are much more progressive
than we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally in Europe, they have drug
policies motivated by pragmatic harm
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: For eight years of the administration
before Obama, any proposition about drug
[SPEAKER_00]: policy that was submitted to our
government, if it had the word harm
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in it, it was rejected out of
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was code for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would not consider anything that was
not incarceration-based rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: pragmatic harm reduction-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Europe, they really are concerned
about drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they lose a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose a lot of people to heroin
overdoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to solve that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it by locking people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it with misinformation and fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it with pragmatic harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, they believe if you take crime
out of the equation, if you take the money
[SPEAKER_00]: and the violence out of the equation,
you can treat drug abuse as a health
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and an education challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun to see the European
approach to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Europe has a concern about hard drugs
and they put marijuana in with alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco as a drug that can be not healthy
for you and so on, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be treated like hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with that approach,
you can look back and see why did
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana end up where it ended up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hanging out with Bud Eagle Crow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the guy who deputized Elvis Presley
to be the drug marshal in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States back in Nixon's rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Nixon decided to Well,
Nixon was just pissed off about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies who were standing against his
Vietnam policies, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought, well, the main drug of all
those hippies, those peaceniks,
[SPEAKER_00]: is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put their drug in with LSD
and heroin or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that day on, I think marijuana
has been tossed in out of where it should
[SPEAKER_00]: be, in with hard, more addictive,
more destructive drugs and not with
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol, where I believe it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at European treatment of
marijuana, you look at their website,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the EU website, there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, where you find it is
problematic cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search and search and search for
marijuana, there is problematic cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in Germany, no, in France,
they had a belief that young men would
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke marijuana so they would be more
comfortable courting women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually had flirting
consultations to help guys be more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with girls without having to
smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems kind of wacky, but the point is
they're thinking out of the box in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to help people not get into drugs when
they don't need to get into drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than criminalizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about how Europe handles
its soft drug, or just any drug abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, it just seems to me it's always
more pragmatic than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm in Scandinavia in May and June,
I'm always impressed by how many wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: drunk teenagers are roaming around town in
the back of decorated trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pickup trucks and flatbed trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ask my friends, what's going
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's graduation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these kids are just getting really
drunk, and their parents are hosting the
[SPEAKER_00]: keggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deal is the parents will rent a
truck with a driver, the parents will get
[SPEAKER_00]: together and have a kegger in each house
or apartment or whatever, and the kids
[SPEAKER_00]: will go from house to house being hosted
by their parents and just get really
[SPEAKER_00]: blitzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the parents know that nobody's going
to be drinking and driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, parents don't want their kids to
drink and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In America, we parents tell our kids,
promise me you won't drink on graduation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and never get in a car with somebody else
who's driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, kids promise that, but invariably in
the United States, because we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: just say no approach, without the
pragmatism and the reality, kids lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids get in cars where people have been
drinking, and on graduation every year,
[SPEAKER_00]: kids die.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Scandinavia, the parents are more
pragmatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids don't have to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody drives and drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids have a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is just wasted the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a Scandinavian pragmatic approach
to a drug abuse problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a very tough sell here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a Scandinavian's point of view,
that is smart drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do the just say no thing,
hire a driver in a truck, and host the
[SPEAKER_00]: kegger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you think about that just for a
little something like alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar pragmatism is in other soft drugs
and in hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go around Europe, you'll find
they have a very, very pragmatic approach
[SPEAKER_00]: to hard drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year in the United States,
18,000 Americans died of heroin overdoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, 10,000 died.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major problem on both sides of the
Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the United States, we lock up a
lot of hard drug users.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, they don't lock them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat them as people who have medical
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get their lives back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just in Switzerland, and when you
want to go to a public restroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a Starbucks, went downstairs to
go to the bathroom, blue lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue lights in the Starbucks toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized, ah, yes, blue lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot see my veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I couldn't shoot up if I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized that's a very,
very European-style pragmatic approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: a persistent problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got all these junkies around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always looking for a private place
to shoot up, and you don't want them doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it in your bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just in Estonia, in a poor part of
town in Tallinn, where the Russian
[SPEAKER_00]: community is next to the underclass in
Estonia, and I went to the gas station,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the toilet, blue lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want the Russian drug
population shooting up in their bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, back to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, they can't shoot up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go across the street, and you see a
machine bolted to a metal railing used to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the machine sells
government-subsidized syringes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it costs like a dollar for two
syringes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just generic syringes distributed
by the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tough sell in the United States,
but in Switzerland, you're crazy to pass
[SPEAKER_00]: needles around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody shares needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get them for almost free on the street
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it, but now I've seen
that in everywhere you look, you see
[SPEAKER_00]: former cigarette dispensers selling
syringes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a society motivated not by
incarcerating people and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: moralistic just-say-no stuff, but
pragmatic, European-style harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down the street, there's a ugly little
gathering of wasted people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cafe fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a heroin maintenance center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks ugly, but it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people in tough streets because
of heroin addiction, and they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: safe place to get counseling, to get their
habit topped up, and a place to get their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives back on track and get back in the
job force.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken tourists around Europe for
years, and a lot of naive Americans say,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many drug addicts over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These Europeans are so liberal,
and look what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the fact is their drug addicts are
alive and not in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out on the streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in cafe fixes, heroin maintenance
comics, getting their needles so they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to swap them down the alley,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite inspiring when I look at how
Europe handles these drug issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an easy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug abuse is a serious problem,
but we can do better here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's very exciting, and a very
good starting point is what we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: right here at Hemfest, raising awareness
of the fact that marijuana should not be
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about marijuana policy in
Europe, Holland comes to mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't arrested a pot smoker there
for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a guidebook to Amsterdam,
so I have to do a lot of research there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the coolest scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got travelers in there checking their
email, and they're just one big cloud of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got older people that don't really
like the youthful kind of vibe,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they just come in and get their pot to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll park their bike, come in,
get what they like, head on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got different sort of personalities at
different coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an older readership, so I get a
little more mellow and laid back kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: places that my readership would be more
comfortable in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to these coffee shops,
you understand the complicated reality of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana commerce post-legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Netherlands, it's not really legal,
because you cannot legalize marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: without finding yourself in a trade war
with the United States of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard of Copenhagen
Christiania, where they've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell me I'm out there, and there's
lots of marijuana flowing around
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, be careful when you leave with
this marijuana, because in Denmark,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to arrest a couple of pot smokers
every year in order to maintain favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: trade status with the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to arrest them,
but it's just a pragmatic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't want to incur the economic
devastation of going into a trade war with
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends who run coffee shops in
Amsterdam explain to me there's those kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of dynamics, and there's a lot of pressure
from the United States, a lot of pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: from right-wing religious groups and so on
for them to roll back the liberalness of
[SPEAKER_00]: their coffee shop culture and their coffee
shop industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's this concern all over Europe
that you don't want to have drug tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: People from more regressive countries take
on the train for two hours to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy up all their pot and then they go
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not... Germany doesn't like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany says marijuana is illegal,
and people go over to cross the border to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Netherlands, pick it up and go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consequently, the coffee shops are the
biggest turnover, are the ones right along
[SPEAKER_00]: the border, and those are the ones that
are having to have cards where you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a local citizen to go there and be a
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear that they're rolling them back
in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always hear the news when they roll it
back, and then in practice it lives on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what the latest is,
but it's a constant struggle over there
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a lot of forces that are
threatened by their progressive attitude
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about the complexity of what
happens after you do legalized marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Goodman, you know him probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a local congressman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running for Congress for James C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool guy, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very courageous, and he's been speaking
out in a very viable, thoughtful,
[SPEAKER_00]: easy-to-embrace, from a general public
point of view, drug policy points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger's just a beautiful guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, he put on a three-day seminar
with the Seattle Bar Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole theme of the convention was,
let's assume marijuana is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you wholesale it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you advertise it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you regulate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's figured this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Netherlands have been doing this for
25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided to quasi-legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the wholesale end of it is still wink,
wink, nudge, nudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to these guys, and they've
got their laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if you're an American here,
you're worried about, oh, if they legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, they're going to be having big
billboards advertising it to my children
[SPEAKER_00]: right across the street from school.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the issues we should be dealing
with here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think of practicality,
where are we going to go with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the Netherlands, they have dealt
with this, and you cannot advertise
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You step into a coffee shop, and this is
what I do in my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in as a clueless tourist,
and I figure out, I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to learn, and I write it down so
people with my guidebooks can learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: my experience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go into a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never been in one before,
you're first struck by, I want to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: some money, but I don't know what to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the menu?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can't advertise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't come at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be like in a restaurant where
they post it on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy says, if you want to know what's
for sale, you've got to push this button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You push this button, and the thing lights
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are physically illuminating the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, it seems like legal hair
splitting, but the point is, the
[SPEAKER_00]: information doesn't come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer goes to the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that seems a little wacky maybe,
but that's dealing with a very real and
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate concern of the general populace
that wouldn't think this is a fun party.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want people promoting pot to
their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can live with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got an issue of, they don't want
people buying a lot and then going and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it pretty much just small time,
so they limit you to just a small amount
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very strict limit of people, only over 18,
that can go into these coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely no hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police see it as a firewall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police like this because they know
where the drug experimenting population
[SPEAKER_00]: goes, and the police are concerned about
hard drug abuse, not soft drug use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police even have bulletin boards in
these coffee shops so they can communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: what's dangerous on the streets in the way
of chemical drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a surprise to think police would
find a coffee shop as a very handy tool
[SPEAKER_00]: for pragmatic harm reduction drug issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real drug policy, rather than just
say no, marijuana's going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a coffee shop in Amsterdam,
there is a limit of 500 grams that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can have in their inventory at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can keep a pound of marijuana in
their shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor of Amsterdam, last time I was
there, was advocating to double that limit
[SPEAKER_00]: to one kilo because it would cut down on
traffic congestion because there was so
[SPEAKER_00]: many little petty deliveries going around
all over town.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could gross a ton of marijuana,
but you can never have more than 500 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: in stock at any one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just find all of these little backside
issues just so fun when you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: how progressive Europeans are and how
creative they are and how unfearful they
[SPEAKER_00]: are, how pragmatic they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was first going to the Netherlands,
you were getting an opportunity to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: pot from Morocco or Pakistan or wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's all grown right there in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the technology to grow the
equivalent of Pakistan or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: liked about Morocco or something like that
right there, and it's too dangerous and
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated for them to import it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to import it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's locally grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things just blossom when you
get down to real pragmatic issues rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than throwing around bumper stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The children at risk thing is a major
concern for Europeans as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch cops know that in the United States,
it's easier for kids to get their hands on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana than it is to get their hands on
alcohol because, as anybody in this game
[SPEAKER_00]: knows, the best way to lose control of
something is to make it illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make it tough for kids to
get, you regulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just regulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a clear, logical sort of thing
that the average fearful voter in the
[SPEAKER_00]: suburbs needs to learn, and that's who we
need to talk with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about the fear in our
society, we can look at Europe and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: they've handled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years ago in Portugal, they decided to
legalize the consumption of all drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: all drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just interviewed their drug czar who
wrote that law for my radio show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it on my website if you want
to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said after ten years now,
they have done a review of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness because there's a little bit
scary to legalize the consumption of all
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've decided after ten years,
even people who were opposed to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that use has not gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took the crime out of the equation,
and now they can deal with it in a smart,
[SPEAKER_00]: pragmatic, harm reduction kind of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they've done is they've made
marijuana boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer quite so sexy, and it's
just there for people who want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Americans think there's a whole
reservoir of people out there that would
[SPEAKER_00]: just love to ruin their lives by smoking
pot if only it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are clueless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who wants to smoke pot,
I think, does, and they just have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: criminals to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm convinced if you legalize marijuana
tomorrow in Washington state, use might
[SPEAKER_00]: spike a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would settle down to about where it is
today, and it would just be a non-issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is in Europe, a non-issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no clear rule book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows exactly how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my little anecdotal case studies in
Europe, every country has a different
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain, you will see marijuana leaves
all over that are just advertising little
[SPEAKER_00]: shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look like little knick-knack
shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are little garden shops,
and these are grow-your-own shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain, you can't sell marijuana,
but you can grow it for your own use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no retail sale of marijuana,
but there is sale of all the gear you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow it well and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you go to Spain, you'll see
that, and you'll have to hang around long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to grow it in order to take
advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that better than the Netherlands
or the Portuguese approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're all better than what we got,
aren't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no perfect solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear people complaining
about 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take a step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take it out of the lock-up,
arrest 800,000 people a year zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we can figure out where to go
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe, even with all of its
flaws, if 502 passes, it becomes less
[SPEAKER_00]: scary for the people that need to have the
fear taken out of this, and from there,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get to a very reasonable
arrangement like they have in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, that's my hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you just a few of the ideas that
came from my talk with the main drug guy
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Seattle police force before he went
to be the police chief of another city.
[SPEAKER_00]: His mission is to protect kids and stop
violence and to enforce existing laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have strong feelings about
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of, I would imagine,
sort of a drag to have to even worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but they have to enforce laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're worried about protecting kids and
stopping violence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't evaluate the laws for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't differentiate between different
kinds of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just when they see problems,
there's drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just drugs equals problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of insulted by medical
marijuana because of the sham aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana, and it is, if I was a
police officer, I would sort of be
[SPEAKER_00]: insulted by it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to delegitimize the whole validity of
medical marijuana, but the fact is,
[SPEAKER_00]: people go in to get their clinic card not
claiming glaucoma, because that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: checked, but they say they got a sore
neck, and that really can't be verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you use that word harm reduction,
that's a catch phrase for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's going to change in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: One problem they have with our whole
discussion is that they don't believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: any of our numbers, and it's hard to get
straight numbers anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on the internet, who made
these numbers up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the right or the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a frustrating thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we could get more numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be credible, I think it's
important that we acknowledge explicitly
[SPEAKER_00]: that children need to be protected from
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to acknowledge that it's not
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be abused, and it can be addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if it can be addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it can be psychologically
addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that have smoked every day
for 20 years, and they just decide to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop, and it's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people, they've got weaker
character, I guess, and they just become
[SPEAKER_00]: psychologically addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's physically addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the case, throw them that bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admit, it can be addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying it should not be a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've been speaking on this for a long
time, and I'll tell you, we've made a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel frustrated, we've made a lot
of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came out, I mean, I spoke on Jim
French's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you old time Seattleites
know Jim French.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great radio guy back in the 80s,
and 70s, and 80s, and I had to go as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anonymous responsible user back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so nice to not have to be so
anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 10 years or so ago, when I joined
Normal and first spoke out, I just felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like, man, I was like some sort of a child
molester or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: People pushed me down on the chair,
and there's all these cameras on me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not scary at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was standing on the main stage yesterday
with the mayor of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of our representatives is into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the people we've got on board for
502, it's just inconceivable five years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Roger Goodman has learned,
you cannot assassinate somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: character politically now because they're
smart on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Goodman's opponents try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend good money trying to make him
seem soft on drugs to his electorate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every time his opponents try to
assassinate his character because of his
[SPEAKER_00]: stand on marijuana, Roger's numbers spike
upward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new age, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a new age, and we've got to be
smart to capitalize on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a little frustrating for me
to come to Hemfest because I get a sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that 90% of the people here, they just are
not doing anything to push it forward in a
[SPEAKER_00]: smart way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivian taught me that in a very nice way
that this is a celebration for a
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate part of our society to come out
and be who they are in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in itself is really something to
celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not my crowd, but I just love
that we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm concerned about is how these
laws are messing up people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we owe it to, if we're good citizens,
we owe it to each other to get out there
[SPEAKER_00]: now and clean up our act and use this word
in polite company.
[SPEAKER_00]: People freak out when they hear the word
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about it in a smart, compassionate,
knowledgeable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share it with community leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took my pastor for a walk and told him
I'm going to be speaking out from now on
[SPEAKER_00]: out about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Church Council of Seattle is with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers are with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers can't talk because they're afraid
of losing their job or their option for a
[SPEAKER_00]: raise or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Politicians are with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The media is with us when the mic is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with the mic all over the
country, and people are asking me all
[SPEAKER_00]: these straight, nervous questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the mic's off, they say,
thank you for speaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to speak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to speak out in a way that does
not scare people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, well, what about your
business?
[SPEAKER_00]: I employ 80 people up in Edmonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this going to matter to your
business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, frankly, I'm not worried about my
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried about the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it hurt my business, I'd do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fun news is, I think it's actually
pretty good for my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only business in Seattle that's
not selling Doritos or rolling papers
[SPEAKER_00]: that's got a band up on the main stage,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real market here if you're just
looking for an advertising in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get a lot of people that read about
what I think about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, I know what you think about pot,
and we're not going to use your guidebooks
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, and we're not going to take any
of your Europe tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I can think is Europe's going to
be more fun without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think the public is ahead of the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are politicians on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the politicians are learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually think the politicians are
ahead of the corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the corporations are really the
scared ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the corporations are really,
in so many ways, they're pissing me off
[SPEAKER_00]: these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one area where they act like
they're moralistic, but they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: reading the tea leaves and what's good for
their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Michael Phelps, is that his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: And who is his under?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kellogg's or something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was caught smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a poster boy for, was it Kellogg's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so Kellogg's was going to say,
get rid of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all their stock values died when they
got rid of Michael Phelps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was it then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Subway Sandwich was also supporting
Michael Phelps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to get rid of him too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a board meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at what happened to
Kellogg's when they got rid of Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: Phelps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Subway thought, we better keep
him on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they came out with an advertising
campaign immediately after that called
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a Subway Sandwich and Feel the Buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just clarified my hunch that
they're only moralistic, not because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're moral, but because they're looking
to profit maximize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can change that so corporations
won't be so threatened by profit
[SPEAKER_00]: maximization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk a fine line in my work with my
underwriting and all this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very careful not to be pro drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm a harm reduction, civil
liberties kind of approach to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's our best approach when
we're going out in the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to remember, our
politicians, as soon as they feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's safe, they'll raise their voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, it's one of those third
rail issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice to you, if you're going to be
speaking out on this, please understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get out of the choir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love to talk on main stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd much rather talk at a rotary club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather talk to 200 rotarians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd rather talk to a couple
thousand people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to get more accomplished if
I go to a rotary club.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half the people here, they put on a suit
the next day and go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to be in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't believe the fun I've had
speaking out on this all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Lutheran of the Year Award,
the Wittenberg Award in Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they introduced me as a board member
of normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't happen a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now people know in their hearts of
hearts that you can be smart on marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means taking the crime out of
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to wrap up here in a
sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends are normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try not to be scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out there in the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at some of your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just flat out scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to you and me, but to the person that
needs to vote for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is they're scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take the scary out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get involved in other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you're involved in something,
you're involved in something like really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and compassionate drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It confuses people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to support you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They respect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they see what you're into here
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give you more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you more credibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preempt attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, they're worried about
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're worrying about driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're worried about hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can preempt that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing gateway about marijuana is
its illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the Europeans have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as soon as it's illegal,
the only way you can get it, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way most people get it is from some
criminal in the street who is interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in getting you hooked on something more
addictive and more profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just be straight and honest about
you believe the responsible adult use of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in a recreational way is a civil
liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to say I'm a hard working,
tax paying, kid raising, church going
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen of this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I work hard all day long,
want to go home and relax, with a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is my civil liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my favorite things I've heard
all in the last couple of years is when
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend John McKay, you know,
the prosecuting attorney, former
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecuting attorney, when he stood on a
stage with us in the ACLU thing here and
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, he's a Republican.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's just a hard law and order
kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said this marijuana law that we're
living with is flat out bad law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that going on our favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor LaGuardia said back in the 30s when
they're dealing with stupid alcohol laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said if a society has a law in the book
that it does not to intend, does it not to
[SPEAKER_00]: intend to enforce consistently across the
board, the very existence of that law
[SPEAKER_00]: erodes respect for law enforcement in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big problem in a society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got that going on right now with
this war on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to remind you once more,
we have a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear other people talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an election year next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand only during a
presidential election, do kids get out and
[SPEAKER_00]: vote in numbers enough to make our
initiatives viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a co-sponsor of 502 and I'm really sad
that we can't have this grow it at home
[SPEAKER_00]: provision, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something I'm going to live
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know other people in the medical
community have their concerns and the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole driving thing, but these laws
evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my main concern is to get over the
summit so that people out there will see
[SPEAKER_00]: they made a law that legalized and
regulated and taxed marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumption didn't go up, crime went out,
and now we can get along with normalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough challenge to get 240,000
signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do something and you can
just write a huge check and you're rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that and they'll hire other people to
get those signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it is a really good
citizenship and it's good hempmanship.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go over to that booth, 502,
check out one of those little clipboards,
[SPEAKER_00]: go home, go to your workplace,
let people you know this is smart law.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good citizenship.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we're going to end the war on
marijuana and then decades from now we can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell our grandchildren that Washington
State was the first state that started the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the prohibition on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an exciting opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's just what I wanted to
share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that we can enjoy the rest of the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy travels, even if you're just staying
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you.
