[SPEAKER_00]: You know, marijuana is the most important
plant on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces more fuel from its seed,
more fiber from its stem, more medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: from its flowers and leaves than any other
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason it was made illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really the petrochemical,
pharmaceutical, military, industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: transnational, corporate, elite,
fascist sons of bitches who made up the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said there's this thing out there in
marijuana that causes us to go crazy and
[SPEAKER_00]: kill our family and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could be more bullshit than that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can drive your car on pure
hip-seed oil, and that's the reason it is
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, finally, we've got some
limited legalization here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can possess an ounce, but you can't
grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to grow our own plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to grow the plant that is the most
productive plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the plant from which agriculture was
founded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the oldest crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All archaeologists agree it's been
cultivated at least 12,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Register to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an I-739 petition booth right over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you to sign those petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even better, get some petitions and get
other Washington-registered voters to sign
[SPEAKER_00]: them, because that's how we make change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't for that, they'd be throwing
us all in jail still.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that to happen, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the legislature passed a bad
law, 5052, to curtail medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have a series of clinics where we
have helped over 100,000 Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: residents get their medical marijuana
permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a quarter million Americans so far,
and those people are able to legally
[SPEAKER_00]: possess, use, and grow marijuana,
but the state has curtailed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying you can grow 50 plants till
next July, but next July, you can only
[SPEAKER_00]: grow four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a petition right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we urge you guys to get these
petitions, sign them, and pass them
[SPEAKER_00]: around, because that's the only way we're
going to be able to change these laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And contact your legislature, because
that's another way to have input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you know, 420 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the most fun place to be
at that special time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, it's only about 15 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to thank you all for
coming out here, support the Seattle Hip
[SPEAKER_00]: Fest, fight for the changes that need to
happen, and restore hip.
