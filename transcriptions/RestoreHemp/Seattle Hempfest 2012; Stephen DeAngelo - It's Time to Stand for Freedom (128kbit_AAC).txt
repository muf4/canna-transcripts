[SPEAKER_00]: This is such an amazing event,
as I was up here on the stage watching
[SPEAKER_00]: that divine cloud of smoke come over this
beautiful crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were all so beautiful, so beautiful in
all of your diversity and all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look out on this crowd, I see people of
every age and every ethnicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people that come from all over,
from every place, from far and wide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're all united.
[SPEAKER_00]: By our love for this plant, and by our
understanding of one truth, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant is a good plant,
not an evil plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I remember the last,
the first few HempFests when there were
[SPEAKER_00]: just hundreds of people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't stay that way though,
did it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew to hundreds, thousands,
tens of thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a movement that's
progressed and mirrored the growth of this
[SPEAKER_00]: event in 17 states across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have medical cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the East Coast to the West Coast,
from North to South, from Michigan to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, from New Jersey all the way here
to Washington, patients are now able to
[SPEAKER_00]: access their medicine in safe,
compassionate, well-regulated dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and access points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not all that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also created tens of thousands of
well-paying jobs and hundreds of millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars of tax revenue for our
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reduced the burden on law
enforcement and we've made our
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhoods safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the folks in the Justice Department
for some reason don't think that those are
[SPEAKER_00]: good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, they launched an attack on
our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That attack started out in Michigan and
Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we didn't notice, when we didn't
respond, when there was no outcry,
[SPEAKER_00]: they expanded it to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've closed over 400,
over 400 dispensaries, access points have
[SPEAKER_00]: been closed in California in the past
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just last week, Harborside Health Center
received notices that the government
[SPEAKER_00]: intends to seize the property that we're
located in because we're serving our
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have no intention of closing our
doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're never, ever going to abandon our
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nothing to hide and we have
justice on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to our day in court when
we intend to teach the Justice Department,
[SPEAKER_00]: the federal government a lesson that
they're never going to forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, unfortunately, I have to tell
you that this cancer has now spread to
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just last week, four letters went out from
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys in the eastern part of the state
threatening to seize properties and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch more in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to do the same thing
here that they did in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not going to let them do that,
are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of crushing us, they're going to
rise up us to righteous fury, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy to tell you that we've had
tremendous support pull in from all
[SPEAKER_00]: quarters around the country after
Harborside was served, including a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great takeover of the Obama headquarters
here by activists in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Seattle, for turning out and
supporting us there at the Obama office,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all pulling together with a common
message to send to the president that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time it's time for him to keep the promise
that he made to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for him to call off these rogue
prosecutors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for them to end their horrible
campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're not going anywhere,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come too far and we've worked too
hard and we've made too much progress to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn back now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to continue this battle until
we win it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came out of the shadows and into the
light 16 years ago, and we're never going
[SPEAKER_00]: back to that place of shadows again,
are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've come out of the shadows and
into the light, and that's where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: staying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
