[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is a hemp creep ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have here is the inner core
portion of the stock, which is similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of what we have here in this bag,
the little woody portions that you see in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we mix this with a line binder
and water, and this becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-structural component of the wall
insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can compress them into blocks to
have structural components of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breathable, resistant to mold,
resistant to fire, and you can learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about that at hemp-technologies.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's carbon negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon negative is what the tests have
shown for our colleagues in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is one of the reasons why we want
to be cultivating industrial hemp in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country, is it so that we can start
decorticating those stocks to create that
[SPEAKER_00]: herd that will need to go into this
building application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only can you use this herd in a
hemp creep, but you can also use it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little bitty piece of pressed
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also is using the hemp herd and
then pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is made in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, just a little bitty pressed block
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep all this organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right here we have hemp
insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pink insulation replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get this in various sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it's cut to be 15 or 16
inches, depending on what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can come with or without a fire
retardant, depending on your needs and
[SPEAKER_00]: building code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have, I think these are both
made in like a needle punch machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-woven matting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very thin piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could use this as what is
essentially made into this briefcase right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, is this type of matting that is then
molded and infused.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also use this as something to go
underneath countertops or as perhaps soil
[SPEAKER_00]: retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, what we have here
is the bast fiber on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the outside of the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the long bast fibers that
you would use to make those non-woven
[SPEAKER_00]: mattings and to make the hemp insulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said last, but there's one more item
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have hemp bast fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the hemp herd fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to tell our audience the
difference between the two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is the little woody core on
the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hemp herd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this in all cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have the long bast fiber on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bast fiber on the outside is what
our colleagues like in China are using to
[SPEAKER_00]: make them amazing textiles such as what I
have on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Hempwarium from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the inner core here is the woody
portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could also use this in type of
applications such as gasification to
[SPEAKER_00]: create heat in greenhouses and in homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very- For animal bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or animal bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing for animal bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cleaned out our chicken coop and
we had the top part was straw and
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath we had the hemp herd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so surprising in Canada in our minus
30 weather how the hemp herd was still
[SPEAKER_00]: really light and fluffy and it was able to
remove the straw quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
