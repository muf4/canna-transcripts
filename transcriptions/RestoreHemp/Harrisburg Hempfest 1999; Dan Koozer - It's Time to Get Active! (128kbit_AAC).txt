[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm Dan with the Canada's Liberation
Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in existence about four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean sure we talk about it, but I mean
now we're doing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually, there's two petitions in
the state of Oregon for the
[SPEAKER_00]: re-legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need help, big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to talk to some people in the
blues to find out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing is we need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the county fair this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been at the county fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been fighting off the officials are
trying to run us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been assaulted, but here's a pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pin that I picked up somebody
gave to me at the county fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been handed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a marijuana leaf with a symbol,
you know, a slice across it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, say no to drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Report marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 1-800 number here and it says
Oregon State Sheriff's Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have one, but I need to find out
where to get these because I thought these
[SPEAKER_00]: would really make great pins for signing
our petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought, you know, we could get
enough of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could even maybe like auction them off
or, you know, sell them for a fundraiser
[SPEAKER_00]: to help fight them, you know, use the
weapon against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got to thinking, you remember
they say there's nothing more minor than
[SPEAKER_00]: the sword?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I blew that, didn't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pin is minor than the sword,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's true, then we have two of the
best weapons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're in a war, the better
weapon you have, the better advantage you
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two of the strongest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we have the pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we could use their pin
against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing is we have the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a radical concept, but the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always thought that the truth,
it doesn't need to be closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can stand naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing is, well, let's get behind
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to my fellow activists and they
tell me, oh, well, we just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to implement the medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's implement the medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made great strides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got fine states that passed
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get no amnesty without legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me it's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization is what we should be working
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean talking about it like I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I and a lot of other hardworking
people are working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no money in legalization,
so you won't find much money in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're scratching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says register to vote in front of our
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a sparkly wind sock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need help not only money-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need help in personnel-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need help in equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you could donate, you think you
could help?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need people that might have computer
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could loan out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get more people online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communication is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get online, more people online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's another idea we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm going to get some more
people some more time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to talk to us any time you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's vote for freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Register and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
