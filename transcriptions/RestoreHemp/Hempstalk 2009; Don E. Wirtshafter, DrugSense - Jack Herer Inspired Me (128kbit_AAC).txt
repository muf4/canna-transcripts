[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Donnie Workshafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started Ohio Hippery in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Jack Carrere inspired me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of Jack's first converts,
and I've been at it full time ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked into hip stock this evening,
and the first thing I see is Jack having
[SPEAKER_00]: his heart attack, or his stroke,
or whatever it is that we just had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you, it was a shock to my
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to speak to you tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to be around right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first met Jack in 1990 when he came.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about when Jack started to hit the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a just say no rally in honor of
Nancy Reagan at KNOW.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack came to Athens, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody talked him around to meet me
because I was the dope attorney at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack spent the evening giving us his
rap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never been the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have to recognize that none
of this would be here without Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without Jack hitting the road in the early
1990s when we had our HEP tour and we had,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, what was it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a HEP bus going around,
and we went college to campus to college
[SPEAKER_00]: to campus, year after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack, every weekend, traveling
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's been a road warrior for 20 years
for this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's become a road animal to get from one
venue to another every weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: every weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carry the books, set up the table,
set up the speaking thing, doing the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, signing books for hours on end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't always as easy for Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't always have so much help.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time people didn't know who he
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he just kept going from college campus
to college campus, trying to raise the
[SPEAKER_00]: image of HEP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1995, everybody knew what HEP was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knew who Jack Carrera was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they named a variety after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people know about the variety than
they know about Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be here without Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack started this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack knew he wasn't feeling well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's wife begged with him not to come up
here this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jack is the road animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack goes somewhere every weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack had to come to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of you might remember 8,
9, 10 years ago when Jack had another
[SPEAKER_00]: stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was down at Condes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were having a World HEP Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave a rousing speech on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He walks off backstage and promptly has a
stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing happened here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you were spared having to see
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that we had so many good
EMTs here in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: People without the right equipment but who
knew what to do to take care of Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: People kept working on Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They worked on Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pushed it on his chest 15 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breathed it in his mouth once.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pushed it on his chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kept him alive for probably 20
minutes until the EMTs came with the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and with the electro shocks and
with the IVs and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to report I kept a pretty good
eye on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to report that they were able to
stabilize Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was breathing on his own when they took
him out of here.
I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know because this was either a fairly
massive stroke or a fairly massive heart
[SPEAKER_00]: attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hurting puppy when they carried
him out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organizers of the show had to think,
oh my God, can we go on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it the right thing for us to do to
shut down the event tonight in memory of
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack and all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they thought about what would
Jack do?
[SPEAKER_00]: The show must go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music coming up, please don't leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be really special here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I came to talk to you about
was DrugSense.
[SPEAKER_00]: DrugSense, MAP Inc., Drug Policy Central.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to be chairman of the board of this
really great organization composed of
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out drugsense.org, MAPinc.org,
and drugpolicycentral.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things we do is we run web
services for over 150 drug policy
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run listservs for these organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a newspaper clipping service
pretty much where we've got almost 200,000
[SPEAKER_00]: articles archived of drug policy articles
over the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage letters to the editors with
all these different ways that we teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: to do letters to the editor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out to MAPinc.org, drugsense.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check these services out because there's a
lot that is there to teach you what we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do to have this crazy drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Carrera would want you to do it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jack needs to stay in our thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really on the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really in a precarious position right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best we can do, I mean,
one of the things was that people
[SPEAKER_00]: backstage were going, come on,
Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jack, come on, Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we weren't going to let that
spirit go away from our presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people just sitting backstage
just praying for Jack, and it seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really thought we lost him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was alive when he left here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the best we can do,
everybody, is just pray, pray,
[SPEAKER_00]: pray for his health and recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: On behalf of Donnie Workshafter,
thank you, Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everybody who puts this
incredible event on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
