[SPEAKER_00]: My background is having been a criminal
defense attorney for, gosh, 11 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 years, and then going to the ACLU of
Washington, where I'm still the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: policy director.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, the ACLU of Washington made
me an in-kind contribution to the New
[SPEAKER_00]: Approach Washington campaign, which is the
campaign that has filed a full
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization initiative, Initiative 502,
which is an initiative to the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go in front of the Washington state
legislature in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may pass it if they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But assuming that they don't, it will then
go on to the November 2012 ballot and be
[SPEAKER_00]: put to the voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, and just following up on the same
observations that David and Dale have
[SPEAKER_00]: already made, is that we are in this
amazing moment of opportunity and also
[SPEAKER_00]: precariousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no state in the country that has
over 55 million people, maybe on a good
[SPEAKER_00]: day, 56% support for majority support for
legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, it depends on how you ask
the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you start to drill down into
a more specific proposal, the support gets
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, here in Washington,
we've got 54% support for some very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific proposals that have been tested
that track pretty closely to what the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot title and the ballot summary for
I-502 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 54% is not a huge majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we all know is that for many,
many years, 75% of the American public has
[SPEAKER_00]: said that the war on drugs is a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zogby Poll tells us that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we don't have is majority support for
the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is what scares people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is where you have to nail down
the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is what happened with
Proposition 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had great support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into a year out before it got to the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did a great job with how much
erosion of support they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming at 46% was great for California in
an off year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people started to get really scared
when they started to look at the details,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they started to try to figure out how
it was actually going to be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a statewide regulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't sure how that was going to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people started to talk about scary
things like stone drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that the people that showed up
should have been with us, setting aside
[SPEAKER_00]: for a moment the whole Emerald Triangle
Humboldt County issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we saw the people that we should have
had, the moderate Democrats, the
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative Democrats, the college
educated women, the independents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw their support peel off at the end,
right before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in Washington, our public opinion
research identifies the exact same people
[SPEAKER_00]: as being the people who are our soft
supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our soft supporters are those conservative
to moderate Democrats, college educated
[SPEAKER_00]: women, mothers, and independents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you address their concerns,
you can hold on to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is a very difficult thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a difficult needle to thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with I-502, we spent a lot of time
figuring out what is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative, safe, secure sounding,
marijuana legalization initiative that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will get us closer to what our
public opinion research tells us people
[SPEAKER_00]: will hang on to and pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are probably familiar with
Nate Silver's meta-analysis of national
[SPEAKER_00]: polling on support for marijuana
legalization in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw that back in the 70s,
we made so much progress in changing our
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 12 states pass decriminalization
laws back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 80s came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the support go in the
opposite direction very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're getting back closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2009, you look at Nate Silver's
graph of support versus opposition for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are this close to the tipping
point, this close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 2012 could be the year when some
state, maybe two states, maybe three
[SPEAKER_00]: states, has just enough to push the rock
over the top of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will see that the sky doesn't
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to get momentum to make
better and better marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how you get that rock over the top of
the mountain, that's where the devil is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure we're going to talk about the
devils in the details of I-502.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that people have a lot of concerns
about some of the things that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here to tell you that what we all
need to be thinking about, most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, is how do we hold on to the
54%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that even possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we push something that,
at its core, is legalization of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: for adults?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we can just get the ball on the
other side, I don't know how many
[SPEAKER_00]: different metaphors here, but if we can
just get past that hurdle, we can fix a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are still, right now, here in
Washington, it's still a misdemeanor to
[SPEAKER_00]: possess marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it carries a mandatory 24 hours in
jail and a $250 fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can mess with your federal
financial aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those of us who live here in Seattle
think that we're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you go to Click Attack County,
and it's a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we're coming from,
with New Approach Washington I-502,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we see that there's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think it's a very slim possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to do everything and be as
disciplined as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pulling together, for example,
the sponsors that signed on to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes,
former US Attorney John McKay,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Steves, two medical doctors,
two former Washington state bar
[SPEAKER_00]: presidents, a Washington state legislator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all the mainstream messengers
possible, because I think a legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative that looks like it's coming
from the choir, that looks like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the usual suspects,
has a much harder road to hoe than one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming from a former US attorney,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the big overview of
where our head is right now, and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're hoping to get accomplished within
the next 15 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
