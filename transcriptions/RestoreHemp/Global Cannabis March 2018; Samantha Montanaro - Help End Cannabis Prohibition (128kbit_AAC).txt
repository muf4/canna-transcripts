[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody, how you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so, so grateful to be here today with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This absolutely beautiful day in downtown
Portland to free the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our earth is hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our people are hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sacred balance of the feminine and
masculine is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know about you, but I believe
that cannabis is the key to restoring
[SPEAKER_00]: balance, to restoring equity, and to
restoring our health.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis legalization, we have an
opportunity to do things differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this as an opportunity for us to
free our people who are sitting in jail
[SPEAKER_00]: still right now as other people profit off
of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an opportunity to create a
solution to our dependency on plastics,
[SPEAKER_00]: on toxic chemicals, and on all sorts of
things that don't seem to make sense for
[SPEAKER_00]: us anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is a solution to many, many,
many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a chance to restore equity for men
and women, for people of all skin colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an opportunity to actually create
programs with equity built into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am envious of the other places that are
putting those policies into place right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, and I want Portland to do the same,
and Oregon to do the same, for us to give
[SPEAKER_00]: assistance to the people that were in jail
and whatever else, give them an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to be working in cannabis
through supportive programs, grant
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, and just assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that this is our duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I think that cannabis
legalization is an opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: empowerment for women and men,
for us to step up and take charge of our
[SPEAKER_00]: own lives and our own health and our own
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you love cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I love cannabis because it heals me
for so many different properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have scoliosis, osteoarthritis,
I'm a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need cannabis for so many reasons on a
daily basis, and I think one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite things about cannabis is it helps
me work through challenges, emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm ready to work out something,
it will bring it up, and it will help me
[SPEAKER_00]: work through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis aids in our pain emotionally and
physically, and until we realize this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the plant will be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis helps me see my truth,
and cannabis helps me face my fears.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all deserve love, happiness,
health, equal rights, and access to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son, Carmine, is here today,
and I want him to live in a world where
[SPEAKER_00]: he's free from shame around using cannabis
as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
