[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things, folks, you got to
remember that now that we're going towards
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, we need to have rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't just accept any
medicine that's out there, any marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, normal, especially here locally,
Oregon Normal, they're your consumer's
[SPEAKER_00]: rights organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're the ones that are going
to help you make sure that your medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: your recreational substance, your
religious substance is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support Oregon Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support National Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're the consumer movement for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like we need a consumer
movement now that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized soon here in Oregon,
2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to stay close to that
and watch the medicine that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, folks, yes, you know, we got to
remember, you know, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized soon, but it's not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to be, you know, careful out
there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows how to be careful,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be really smart about what
you're doing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one of the few things that
we have to worry about if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: cardholder is, you know, not in the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we'd all love right here to smoke
a giant bowl right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Russ.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking mighty thirsty for a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, Russ is going to smoke a
bowl because he knows that's against the
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russ is smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Russ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russ is afraid of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Russ is afraid of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should all be afraid of jail,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for marijuana activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't use your medicine in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you want to go to jail?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to stay out of jail,
folks, we've got, you know, we've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: four sayings to help keep you out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say these, and I want
everybody here to say them after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when an officer approaches you,
whether you're in your car, on your
[SPEAKER_00]: bicycle, on foot, and anywhere an officer
approaches you, say, am I free to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it louder than that because the
officer didn't hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next one is, this is
important because they'll try and trick
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to say, I do not consent to any
searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you want to make sure
you're able to contact one of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, somebody like myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish to speak to an officer or an
attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to speak to an attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, then the other thing now,
our Supreme Court, US Supreme Court,
[SPEAKER_00]: in their wisdom, they say that you must
speak to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense, but who's,
you know, these are just some old folks in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number four is, I wish to remain
silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not right now, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want to thank everybody for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, you've got to practice these
sayings every day, brushing your teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're riding the Max, riding the
bus, mumbling to yourself, look like one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those people on the bus you don't want
to sit next to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I free to go, officer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consent to any searches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to speak to my attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
