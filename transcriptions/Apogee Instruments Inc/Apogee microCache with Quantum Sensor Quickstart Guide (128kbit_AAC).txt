[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith and I do
technical sales and support here at Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're going to do a quick start
video for how to connect your PQ500,
[SPEAKER_00]: PQ510, which is the SQ500SS with the
AT100, which is the MicroCache Bluetooth
[SPEAKER_00]: Logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video, we're going to cover the
Apogee Connect app download, the Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect and connecting to the MicroCache,
and then making sure your sensor is set up
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly in the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to go over setting up
logging to the MicroCache Logger and then
[SPEAKER_00]: how to collect those logs after you've
come back to the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the app looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, you can see the iOS when you
search for Apogee Connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over there is the Google Play,
what it will look like there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead and download that to your
phone or tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, this is the quick start guide
that we include with the MicroCache in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you've lost that, you can just
pause on this screen and you can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: these directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through each one of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this page is the quick start
guide on how to set up logging,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to begin logging the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here, we're going to do the
quick start guide to collecting logs from
[SPEAKER_00]: the MicroCache.
[SPEAKER_00]: After it's been logging and how to go out
and get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you're welcome to pause on the
video to review those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we will do a demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that a second to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here, you can see we have an iOS
device and we've just opened the Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what yours will look like the
first time you come into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we want to do is get
the MicroCache advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hold down the green button for three
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts blinking blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nothing happens over here until
we hit add.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit add up in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now it comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says UC 1080.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look on the back of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says 1080.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that's the correct one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We click on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to come up and it says
SP 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have an SP 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an SQ 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start by clicking on choose model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we're here, we're going to
scroll down until we find the SQ 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to click on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not have a custom calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a standard calibration for the SQ
500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we want to rename him,
if we're expecting a couple, we can name
[SPEAKER_00]: him whatever we want, but we can just put
home on here for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can hit add.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've changed the name to home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're showing on this screen now that it's
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, not logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we come in here after it's not
connected and open up Apigee Connect,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see an X through connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we're here, we can go into
this sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we see is that we are
reading accurate values right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get that to increase or
decrease just by changing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we want to go to live meter
mode, we can click right there and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: updating our live meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we want to collect the data,
we can record the current value just by
[SPEAKER_00]: clicking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to record that in the table
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, this table updates based
on the amount of light that we're shining
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see that it's a very fast
updating right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we wanted to average out that live
sample data, we can do that under
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll show you that here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is important to note that on this
graph, it does go away if I click back and
[SPEAKER_00]: go to a different screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's only live meter right now as
you're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not saving this graph anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is perfect for going around doing
spot measurements and seeing how the light
[SPEAKER_00]: changes depending on where we move that
sensor around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about setting up logging
as well as various settings we can go
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing, so settings,
we don't have a custom calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can rename it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we didn't like home, we want to name it
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to worry about dark offset
calibration with this sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is logging enabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come back here and enable
this here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you want to turn on if you're
using this underwater in aquarium and
[SPEAKER_00]: coral reef applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you turn on that correction factor,
which then turns this into the equivalent
[SPEAKER_00]: of reading the same as like an MQ-510 that
we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have notify when full when you're
logging your data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can load, log up to 400,000 data
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing it for a long time in
the field, you can click that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that setting we mentioned before,
live data averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently it's averaging samples over one
second and reporting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that you can increase this
up to as high as 30 seconds on that live
[SPEAKER_00]: data averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have some information down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardware version, the firmware
version, and then sensor time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're always going to want to match
current time when you get in here to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way it matches the time in
here that's logging the time state stamps
[SPEAKER_00]: and then to what your phone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way when you go to collect the
logs later, those numbers are already set
[SPEAKER_00]: and matched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then update sensor firmware.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to the first time you get
that to click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're connected to it, you click
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go ahead and check itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now a red LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's seeing if it's updating
it to the latest version that's available
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to see it bleak
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's back connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a quick process as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back up here to setting up
logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went over dark threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark threshold right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dark threshold means what you're
willing, how much light you're willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the sensor and still say and let it
and say that it is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are willing to go up to two
micromoles or two and a half micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people need it less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can change that dark threshold to
whatever you want, which is important when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're logging your daily lightated grills
and your photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can move that around to what you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it comes standard at 0.5 micromoles
per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logging enabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we slide logging enabled on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes up as 10 minute logging
interval and one minute sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that in this example it will
take 10 readings because it's doing one
[SPEAKER_00]: every minute and then every 10 minutes
it's logging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one reading every minute and then it
will average all 10 of those and log that
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we recommend 15 minutes for our logging
interval and then your sampling interval
[SPEAKER_00]: will give you equivalence of that out to
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do every two and a half minutes
for sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason that we encourage 15 minute
logging period is because it affects the
[SPEAKER_00]: battery life.
[SPEAKER_00]: By having a 15 minute logging average,
if you're just going for the daily totals
[SPEAKER_00]: of light, your battery is going to last
nine months to a year depending on other
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, temperature and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we go logging interval all the way
down to less than 10 seconds, sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: intervals less than 10 seconds will
decrease battery life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can decrease it all the way down
to a week, down to weeks instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to make sure that
your logging and sampling interval is set
[SPEAKER_00]: up for whatever your application is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just know it will take a toll on the
battery if it is too quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get this out to a minute or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to hit save down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we hit save, now it's saved in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says we started right here and it
will be filled by 2032.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have quite a ways before our data
will be filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now our logging is enabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because we did a firmware update,
it came through and it gave us this big
[SPEAKER_00]: number but we know that those logs are not
correct so we want to clear the logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we clear logs down to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it currently has zero logs to gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we set it up for filled logging
the first time once we want to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: logs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we click on collect logs and then we
come here to create new which is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then new data set right here,
we can rename that whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do the start time and the end
time down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these should be auto filled because
the start time is when he enabled logging
[SPEAKER_00]: and then end time is the current time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just hit collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well right now there's zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so down below it is giving us that
there is no data collected and so our
[SPEAKER_00]: graphs down here have not been updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our demonstration we will grab this
PQ500 we have right here and we'll bring
[SPEAKER_00]: it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same sensor in MicroCache.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this screen we're going to hold down
until it blinks blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold down the green button until it blinks
blue then we will add it searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Skyler's Yard because that's the
experiment I was running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for the best spot for a
garden in my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can connect to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remembers that it's an SQ500 but since
it's the first time on this phone it's
[SPEAKER_00]: asking me if it's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that our micromole value is
very similar since they're right here both
[SPEAKER_00]: on the platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see logs available for
collection is seven.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down here it has never collected logs
and so we don't see any data down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to collect logs and so again
it's the first time on this phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to create new and I'm going
to call it 2020Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just rename that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's start time and end time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now because I just connected it the start
time says 2.15.
[SPEAKER_00]: However I know that the data goes all the
way back to April but I for sake of time I
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to collect about a week's worth
of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go back to Tuesday June 9th and
let's go to midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that to 2.12.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0 0 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our start time end time and then
we're going to collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it jumps from seven that it had been
collecting within the last couple minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it's done downloading all of this
data it's going to to auto populate down
[SPEAKER_00]: here and this is going to give us our
micromoles per day down here and then this
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to give us our moles per day or
our DLI daily light integral and then our
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period is going to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just takes a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already halfway through and then we
will see the data pop up underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see right here a couple days
it's been in the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that it was out in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some beautiful clear days and
then we can see some rainy some rainy days
[SPEAKER_00]: out in my yard and then down here is the
real gem where we can see our DLI values
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can say we're between 40 and 50
moles per day for the place that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put my tomatoes in the ground and then
down here we can see the photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just about 16 hours a day
currently right now in June for Logan,
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now anytime after this that I want to
collect logs I'm going to collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to append existing and then I'm
going to hit collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and it said zero because we have zero
right now but in a couple minutes it will
[SPEAKER_00]: have another log and then another and so
from this point on I just want to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to append to existing and then
collect logs and then it will
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically update these graphs below
and then if I want the data so I can view
[SPEAKER_00]: the data and then right here is that share
button so I can export it out to myself
[SPEAKER_00]: and email all that data so then I can
analyze it under my own excel sheet as
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that that concludes our quick
start video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions feel free to
email us at techsupport at
[SPEAKER_00]: ApogeeInstruments.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
