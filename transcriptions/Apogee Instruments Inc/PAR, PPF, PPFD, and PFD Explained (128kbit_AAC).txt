[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments and I wanted to record a video
[SPEAKER_00]: to discuss terminology for measuring
photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real confusing to people and the
terms have evolved over the last 20 or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, since Apogee is in the business of
helping people make excellent measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: of this, we want to make sure the
terminology is also clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is going to be a short video but
I want to take you back to the 1960s when
[SPEAKER_00]: we used to measure radiation only with a
pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is going way back and let me put
this curve over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's wavelength and this is all short
wave radiation and this curve looks
[SPEAKER_00]: something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill in that spot right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2,800 nanometers out here and this
is about 280 nanometers right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all short wave radiation from the
Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only this part right here causes
photosynthesis This is this part right in
[SPEAKER_00]: here and you have to remember what the
instruments were like in the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured all of this and used it to
predict plant growth but we also knew that
[SPEAKER_00]: this part over here is near-infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put NIR and our instruments
that included this, it was not a good
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, with this, this is PAR right here,
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first term that we evolved to
say we're only counting PAR as the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is in the 1960s and even into the
1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was everywhere in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR, that's what we're measuring but what
were the units people used?
[SPEAKER_00]: The units we used for all of this are
watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what drives transpiration but it's
not what drives photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part drives photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we developed this term PAR but we kept
the units the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said PAR was watts per meter squared
and it was an improvement over the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith McCree comes out in the early 1970s
and says no, it's not the energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the number of photons that cause
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start counting photons not
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we evolved from the term PAR to
measure this stands for photosynthetically
[SPEAKER_00]: active radiation to a term called PPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is an easy term to remember,
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stands for photosynthetic photon flux
and it's a more rigorous term and this in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1960s and 70s, this often meant watts
per meter squared which was not very
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This specifically meant micromoles of
photons per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story would end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a more rigorous term for moles of
photons than the old term PAR but language
[SPEAKER_00]: evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: People kept using PAR to mean micromoles
per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it got confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terms were used interchangeably and
they are used interchangeably to this day
[SPEAKER_00]: but we try to use a more rigorous term for
just the photons flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the P stands for photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write this down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to get a degree in plant
science, you've got to remember 400 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about PPFD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that different?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what part of the literature
you read.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two terms have been used
interchangeably for 50 years in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature and they are still used
interchangeably today and even during my
[SPEAKER_00]: career as a researcher, we have used these
interchangeably but we are evolving now to
[SPEAKER_00]: different definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The D stands for density.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up on the internet the word
flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me see if we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to a next screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to that screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the definition of a flux?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you type it in, do a Google search,
you come to the Wikipedia page and it says
[SPEAKER_00]: flux equals an amount
[SPEAKER_00]: per area per time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is micromoles per meter squared per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up flux density,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is also micromoles per meter squared
per second but it turns out physicists
[SPEAKER_00]: have trouble with the word flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people define flux as just an amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to abbreviate amount per time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If flux means an amount per time,
let me put something like about.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terms are used interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: If flux means an amount per time,
then we reserve flux density for amount
[SPEAKER_00]: per area per time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my publications starting about three
years ago, we started to use PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of PPFD, we used PPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we used PPF, the argument was that
the D is redundant and that's the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: case in writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put redundant things in your writing,
the PPF was adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were using PPFD separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a big literature survey and it turns
out people in plant ecology were using
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD and people in horticulture and
agronomy were mostly using PPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, different disciplines use this acronym
slightly differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think that's horribly confusing
but both of them always showed the units
[SPEAKER_00]: after this and as long as you show the
units, you know what people are talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: About three years ago, I started using
PPFD and what that means is now we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF to mean just, I'm going to see if I
can put it right here, micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: No area in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one for sure has the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is area times time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, historically, these have been used
interchangeably but we're trying to shift
[SPEAKER_00]: the terminology in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is papers that I review as a
scientist in both my own writing to use
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The argument now is it's better to be
redundant than it is to risk being unclear
[SPEAKER_00]: because D always means area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now we're starting to evolve a
definition where this just means per
[SPEAKER_00]: second, no area in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference between these terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we go back to this, PAR is still
used by lots of people in just common
[SPEAKER_00]: speech to refer to a photon flux density
but technically, we try and reserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: term PAR for a generic term that could
mean energy flux, it could mean photon
[SPEAKER_00]: flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD, we try and reserve for an amount per
area per time and then now we're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to use PPF, no meter squared, just
micromoles per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in our literature at Apogee,
you will see when we talk about a flux,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will say PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's redundant to some people but
it's absolutely clear to have all four of
[SPEAKER_00]: those letters in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of this would be, let's take a
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if we can go one more screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're testing some light and this has
photons coming out of it, if we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know the total number of photons out of
this light, we would do a PPF in
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no area, it's a total.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if the photons weigh
over here or in the middle, it's a total
[SPEAKER_00]: number of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important when we're testing the
efficacy of a light but if we want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: the intensity at any given place,
now we have to put the meter squared in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say this is the intensity because if
you don't know the area, you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of light for plant growth and
now when we put that area in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the D stands for density and that
stands for meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to think about this, let's try one
more screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a box right here, oh man,
that's a bad box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can erase that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a three-dimensional box like a
giant cookie sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our photons coming in like
raindrops into this box, falling into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to know the number of photons
we get, we want to know amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: raindrops per meter squared of box per
unit time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We defined all three things and now we
know the intensity of the rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just said the photons, there was
10,000 photons per second, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful because we need to know the
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always need to have the meter squared
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you read literature, look for the
units.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the units are correct and they should
be micromoles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second, you will see the older literature
used to call that PPF and it's fine as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as they've defined it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're trying to change this to PPFD
and we have begun using that at Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've begun using it in science and that's
the evolution of language from one term
[SPEAKER_00]: that we thought was adequate to a new term
that has more letters in it to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to talking to you again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new term that we have started to
use in our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that this P stands for
photosynthetic and that means 400 to 700
[SPEAKER_00]: but we now know these photons out here,
let's see if we can put this in red,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's photons right here that we call
far-red radiation that actually cause some
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're calling into question this whole
definition of 400 to 700 and even more
[SPEAKER_00]: than that down here, let's see if we can
do this in blue, this is U-ultraviolet and
[SPEAKER_00]: these have some effect both on
photosynthesis and on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we say the PPFD, that automatically
excludes these because the P means
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic and for 30, 40,
50 years we've said that's 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're looking into the future
evolution of language and terminology more
[SPEAKER_00]: than language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a new term.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just when you thought you had it right,
here's a new term.
[SPEAKER_00]: This P stands for photons, not
photosynthetic, the photon flux density
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we use this term, we are not
constrained by 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do research, the PFD,
when we're using it, can mean 300 to 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a new emerging term that counts
these photons at the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the extra P in it,
which means photosynthetic, it's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: total number of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for it in the literature,
it's going to be a useful term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
