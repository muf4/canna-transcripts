farmers, and scientists that depend on you
[SPEAKER_00]: and your precipitation network for
reliable, accurate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking to upgrade your
precipitation gauges to a gauge that can
[SPEAKER_00]: more accurately monitor solid
precipitation, like snow and hail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but worry about the high prices of
weighing precipitation gauges?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for a more capable,
more accurate, more robust, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effective former precipitation

[SPEAKER_00]: The Cloudburst features a rugged,
all-weather housing with a black,
[SPEAKER_00]: ionized inlet that naturally sheds snow
and resists capping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inlet comes in two sizes, both with
optional heating elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no moving parts to get
overwhelmed, clogged, or seized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cloudburst provides you with both
filtered and raw data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assembled and shipped from the U.S.,
the Cloudburst has been designed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effective in both implementation and
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cloudburst's maintenance is quick,
simple, and tool-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a large capacity cistern,
maintenance intervals are reduced,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning less hassle and less labor in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: After eight years of development with
several beta testers, the Cloudburst has
[SPEAKER_00]: been designed to meet your needs and has
proven to meet the highest of standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Apogee Cloudburst,
an excellent solution for your
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation monitoring needs,
no matter what weather.
