[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce kind of introduced my topic at the
end of his last presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a bit about spectral
reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put all of these pictures and the
different scales on my introductory slide
[SPEAKER_00]: just because there's lots of different
scales that you can consider when
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring reflectance everywhere from a
single leaf measurement all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: satellite measurement of the Earth's
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think mostly what I'm going to talk
about is more reflectance principles but
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be down in more of this range of
scale but some of or most of what I will
[SPEAKER_00]: say will apply to all of the scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again if you have any questions feel
free to ask while I'm going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflectance is a pretty simple concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just divide the reflected radiation so
everything that's bouncing off the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and coming back by the radiation that's
incident on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's powerful, simple but powerful
because we can learn a lot about surface
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, surface conditions based on
how the reflectance signal changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already seen this plot more than one
time today so I won't spend too much time
[SPEAKER_00]: on it but it shows the shortwave radiation
spectrum at Earth's surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in most applications not all
because we can do this in the laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can also do it on small leaf
samples where we often use artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: lights but when we're talking about the
scales of plant canopies and flux towers
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that typically the light
surface or the light source is the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so incident radiation is these data
that you see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have to invert our sensor and
measure the reflected signal and that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the numerator of our equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do that it looks like this for
some surfaces that we're all familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have water, soil, a plant canopy and
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see one thing that sticks out
immediately from this slide is we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance to characterize what it is at
the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that's necessarily a
major application because there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of characterizing what's going on at
the surface but the reflectance signatures
[SPEAKER_00]: are very very different when we move from
one surface to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you an idea of how much it
costs to measure the different wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get the visible spectrum and a
little bit of the near-infrared maybe 350
[SPEAKER_00]: or 400 nanometers up to about a thousand
nanometers or so is a reasonable price
[SPEAKER_00]: tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to get that same wavelength range
plus more of the near-infrared,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're talking about maybe half of the
solar spectrum, we're getting a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: price tag and to get the whole spectrum
we're talking about a lot more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the price scales with the amount of
information that you're measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly going to talk about this range
of 350 or 400 up into the 1000 range
[SPEAKER_00]: largely because that's the more affordable
range and that's the type of instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: that we typically deal with, at least at
Apogee instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to focus on the reflectance
spectrum for a plant canopy for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there are a lot of unique
features here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that we already talked about earlier
is the photosynthetically active radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: range which is 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that it's so much lower than a
lot of the other parts of the reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum is because green leaves have a
lot of chlorophyll in them and the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll is absorbing all of the
photosynthetic photons for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole portion of the spectrum is
depressed, small values, because all those
[SPEAKER_00]: photons are being absorbed for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that range we have this little
green peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why plants are green.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the red edge, so the point where
we transition from the photosynthetically
[SPEAKER_00]: active range to the near-infrared range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It jumps up here because everything beyond
about 700 are non-photosynthetic photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a high percentage of them are being
reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of these dips here are water
absorption bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy plant leaves tend to have a lot of
water in them and once you get out into
[SPEAKER_00]: the near-infrared range water is a pretty
good absorber of certain wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a water band about 970 or 980,
another one around 11 to 1200,
[SPEAKER_00]: another one about 1400, and then another
one about 1900 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can learn something about
potentially about photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: about water, different variables based on
measurements of plant reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide illustrates how you would do it
for a single leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically this is done in the laboratory
and it requires an artificial light
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a fiber optic cable that's going to
absorb the light, take it back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectroradiometer which actually makes the
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we start we have to have a
reflectance spectrum, a reference
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a small highly reflective white
surface to give us a reference spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially this would represent the
denominator in the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make this measurement this would
represent all of the incident radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming our reflectance panel has a high
reflectivity, something near 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after we make our measurement on a
reflectance panel, and often this is made
[SPEAKER_00]: out of spectralon or PTFE, some material
that has really high reflectivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: near 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get our reference measurement,
the denominator of the reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: equation, then we can put the sample under
the light source and measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance from the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice we have to have some kind of
flat black background behind the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce talked a little bit ago about how
reflectance and transmission spectra look
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar, they're kind of analogs of
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well if you have some photons that are
being transmitted through the leaf and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a highly reflective background,
like if we put the leaf over top of our
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance panel, some of those
transmitted photons would reflect off the
[SPEAKER_00]: white background, be transmitted back
through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually get measured as reflected
photons rather than photons that were
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted all the way through the leaf,
reflected off the back, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted back through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you measure your sample you put it on
top of some kind of flat black background
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a very low reflectivity,
so we can assume that all the reflection
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from the sample itself, in this case
a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this measurement, as I mentioned,
represents the denominator of our
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This measurement over here represents the
numerator of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is how you would make a
laboratory measurement of a single leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we move to the field to do it for
a plant canopy, for example, the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: method isn't that much different,
and I'll explain it when we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you an idea of the kind of
information that leaf reflectance might
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate, we have two reflectance spectra
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One where the peak in the green and then
some of this radiation in the red is more
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflectance is higher, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would represent a well-fertilized
leaf with a high nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one would represent potential of
nitrogen deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get changes in the spectrum as a
function of properties of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's related to nitrogen,
but there could be other properties that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can measure by analyzing the changes in
the reflectance spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we move to the field,
the reflectance for a plant canopy looks
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to the reflectance of a single
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the previous data were for a single
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a reflectance spectrum
that we measured on a plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in times past, we're interested in
very specific portions of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that everybody, I think, is familiar
with is the difference between red
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance and near-infrared reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highlighted them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a long time, we've used
reflectance measurements of these two
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths, somewhere in the red and
somewhere in the near-infrared,
[SPEAKER_00]: to quantify NDVI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard this acronym before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index, where we take near-infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance minus red reflectance in the
numerator, and then we take the sum of the
[SPEAKER_00]: two in the denominator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have strong absorption of
photons and low reflection in the red and
[SPEAKER_00]: high reflection in the near-infrared,
essentially NDVI is a greenness index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can measure it, and it tells us
about how much leaf area is covering the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface or how green the surface is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are small devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an instrument from Decagon devices
that we can use to measure specific
[SPEAKER_00]: indices, like NDVI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this small sensor that I've shown here
is essentially a two-channel or a two-band
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has one sensor in it that measures the
red range and another sensor in it that
[SPEAKER_00]: measures the near-infrared range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes those measurements, does this
calculation internally, and outputs an
[SPEAKER_00]: NDVI value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're only interested in specific
indices like NDVI, then small,
[SPEAKER_00]: low-cost radiometers like this can be very
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed some prices earlier of
spectroradiometers, and 3,000 to 6,000 was
[SPEAKER_00]: a rough estimate of an instrument that
would give you this reflectance spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This two-channel radiometer is about an
order of magnitude lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be maybe a 300 dollar
instrument somewhere in that ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But red and near-infrared reflectance
aren't the only wavelengths of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red edge can be very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often we're interested in blue
reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another index kind of like
NDVI.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mathematical form is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see in just a second that uses
reflectance at 531 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: a green wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reflectance at 570 nanometers,
kind of a yellow wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called PRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means photochemical reflectance
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take the reflectance at 570 and
minus the reflectance at 531 and divide
[SPEAKER_00]: that by the sum of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get this PRI, and it's still being
studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: To better understand what PRI is actually
measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems to be closely related to
light use efficiency of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so PRI and NDVI, we can measure again
with these small low-cost devices like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that Dekagon also has a PRI
instrument in addition to the NDVI
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there turns out there are a whole host
of fairly simple reflectance indices that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been published in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a relatively recent review paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a table from that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where 20 different, I think there's 20 of
them on there, relatively simple
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance indices are shown here that
are all attempting to quantify different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got chlorophyll content,
photosynthetic activity, liquid water
[SPEAKER_00]: content, carotenoids and xanthophyll
cycle, anthocyanin, canopy water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of different plant properties
that people have attempted to estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: using reflectance indices or learn about
using reflectance indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got a list from a colleague one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unpublished, but the list that she
had compiled had 62 different reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: indices in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of these things out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the point that I want to make is
if, again if you're interested in one
[SPEAKER_00]: index like just NDVI or just PRI,
these relatively simple two-band and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I've seen three or four band
radiometers are available to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: information on a single index.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes sense that why not use the
whole spectrum if we can, rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to just build sensors for specific
indexes only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what a spectroradiometer gives
you, is a measurement of the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons I think that maybe this
hasn't been more widely used or is maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: just starting to be more and more applied
in research and especially in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: operations is in the past
spectroradiometers tended to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes they're large and heavy and so
they require an operator or a computer and
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're not necessarily easy
instruments to take from the laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: and use routinely in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little bit challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hence there is a lot of use of these
small narrow bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again single or dual or three channel
radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Apogee spectroradiometer,
we tried to design it to overcome some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these challenges and limitations and make
it more of a field instrument in addition
[SPEAKER_00]: to a lab instrument if you wanted to use
it in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the features are highlighted here
but really we wanted to try to make
[SPEAKER_00]: something low-cost, small, lightweight and
there it is compared to a couple quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors just so you can get an idea of the
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some applications and I won't go into a
ton of detail here but this is the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you could do with a unit like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuous automated measurement of plant
canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often we're interested in plant response
to environment and environmental change
[SPEAKER_00]: and this might be one way to quantify that
measuring reflectance spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another potential application is precision
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rapid field phenotyping of crop plants
looking for differences in genetic lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can mount them on mobile instruments
and collect high-frequency data for
[SPEAKER_00]: precision ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said a few minutes ago when I was
explaining how to make the reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement in the lab that the procedure
was relatively similar for making
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of different
approaches that you can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be to mount one instrument level
and looking up and another instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing down at the plant canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you the reflected spectrum,
this gives you the incoming spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratio of the two is a reflectance
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using an approach like this you actually
have to match the spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in essence it's a field calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the data for this one to match
this one when we have a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is you have to use a
reflectance panel which is a diffused
[SPEAKER_00]: reflector with reflectance near a hundred
percent to match the spectroradiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you start it essentially means you
have to put your reference panel,
[SPEAKER_00]: your reflectance panel underneath the
downward looking instrument and then
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate this one to match the output
from that one and then when you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to remove the reflectance panel you can
take the ratio directly and it will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement of reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some requirements of users
being in the field to make the system work
[SPEAKER_00]: before you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to match the spectroradiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is you could make
measurements with a single downward
[SPEAKER_00]: looking instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take this one away we can make
measurements with this one by saving the
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement when we've got a reflectance
panel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This becomes the denominator in our
equation and then when we remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance panel subsequent measurements
become the numerator in the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just take the ratio of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge with doing it this way is
every time the sky conditions change we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to make a new measurement of the
background radiation with the reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: panel because the if the sky conditions
change that means the denominator and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance equation changed and we have
to account for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's multiple ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using two instruments like this would be
the way to do it for long-term unattended
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only had a single measurement
that'd be the way to do it if it's more of
[SPEAKER_00]: an on-the-fly mobile measurement where
it's convenient to make the reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement the background measurement
periodically as the sky conditions change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually made some measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in the process of beta testing
this instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually made some measurements in the
backyard of our facility at Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments in Logan, Utah just over a
turf grass surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our configuration essentially looks
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an upward facing instrument and a
downward facing instrument We used a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrolon panel to match the downward
instrument to the upward instrument and
[SPEAKER_00]: this gives you some sample data.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned this was over turf grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it a bit more interesting we
intentionally stopped irrigating the turf
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the reflectance measurement on
the last day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the irrigation system was on and then
we turned off the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: About three days later on August 24th the
reflectance spectrum was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five days later on August 29th it was here
and then four days later on September 2nd
[SPEAKER_00]: it was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's some pretty
substantial changes in the reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum as the grass dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going from well watered to water stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of data that
spectroradiometers yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The changes in or plant responses to
environmental change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could potentially learn a lot about
plants without having to sample them and
[SPEAKER_00]: take them back to the lab for analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we have a way to measure the
light reflectance as a function of changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the environment.
