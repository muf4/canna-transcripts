[SPEAKER_00]: Some organisms like plants, corals,
algae, and certain bacteria need light to
[SPEAKER_00]: live, but not just any type of light will
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most photosynthetic organisms require
light specifically from the spectral range
[SPEAKER_00]: between 400 and 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments' line of quantum
sensors offer a cost-effective and
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable way to measure the photosynthetic
radiation, or PAR, that reaches any target
[SPEAKER_00]: from a specific light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitoring PAR is critical to optimizing
specimen health and is strongly correlated
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments' quantum sensors are
trusted for use all over the world in many
[SPEAKER_00]: different applications, such as monitoring
the output of electric lights in growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oceanographers, limnologists, and
biologists use them to measure different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions affecting aquatic productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquarists measure the PAR of lights used
for growing coral reefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecologists mount them on flux towers to
monitor factors affecting various
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant scientists use them to measure
PAR above and below plant canopies when
[SPEAKER_00]: calculating transmissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee's quantum sensors provide excellent
quality for the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each sensor comes fitted with our unique
blue diffuser that reduces spectral errors
[SPEAKER_00]: to less than 5% for sunlight and common
electric lights, and to less than 10% for
[SPEAKER_00]: most LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single-sensor models feature our
dome-shaped self-cleaning system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All models are milled from 6061 aluminum
alloy and then potted solid, making them
[SPEAKER_00]: waterproof and ideal for long-term use in
the harshest conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Models are available in single-sensor or
multi-sensor line quantum configurations
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be used to measure spatial PAR
averages in conditions such as under plant
[SPEAKER_00]: canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensor-only models are available with
pigtail leads for data loggers and come
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-calibrated for either electric or
natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instantaneous readings in the field,
models are available with an attached
[SPEAKER_00]: handheld meter that features both sunlight
and electric modes.
