[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee and this is a continuing
series of seminars on principles of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this next mini seminar we're going to
talk about radiation shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you protect a sensor from solar
radiation to shade it to get it to more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately measure true air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is something like many things
that we thought we knew how to do ten
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start to do more rigorous tests
and we start to find out the things we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about the past
eight years of research on radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: shields and how we've modified shields and
come up with a new type of shield that
[SPEAKER_00]: uses less power and is more accurate than
traditional things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joined in this effort by Mark
Blonquist, the chief scientist at Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I have been doing tests on this in
many places over a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at the types of
shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a great picture of these shields
against the sky and it summarizes the five
[SPEAKER_00]: types of shields I'm going to talk about
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at an angle so there's a little
bit of wide angle distortion here but
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the shields that everybody is
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call these multi-plate shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also called passive shields or
static shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rely on the wind to cool it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind is supposed to go through them
and it's supposed to shade the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been used on hundreds of thousands
of weather stations over many decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at how accurate they are
compared to improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one made by MetSpec in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a second type right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is made by RM Young.
[SPEAKER_00]: These come in multiple heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used ones that are tall so the very
best of this technology but we compared it
[SPEAKER_00]: to three active shields that have a fan in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a fan blowing over something
it doesn't heat up in the sun the way a
[SPEAKER_00]: static shield does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can imagine if the sun is bright
and the wind is not blowing these heat up
[SPEAKER_00]: above air temperature and with the fan the
problem is greatly diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this series of tests I'm going to
show you we looked at the MetOne shield
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a long tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the biggest of the three
shields and the inlet to the air comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom right there and then the outlet
of the air comes out the top up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second shield we looked at is the RM
Young shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the air is coming in the bottom
blowing out the top and the third shield
[SPEAKER_00]: we looked at is an Apogee fan aspirated
shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing air is coming in the bottom and
out the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll look at the data and then we'll
look at some of the physical principles
[SPEAKER_00]: that result in air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after years of work and refining that
design the next step is field testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've tested these now in multiple
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I show you the data let's look
at the locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first test sites is at Campbell
Scientific here in Logan Utah and here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the multiple replicate shields you can see
on this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: MetSpec shields, small multiplates,
big multiplates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Apogee shield right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an RM Young shield there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the anemometer for wind speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the test sites run over
an extended period of time to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in measurement accuracy caused
by shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these all have accurate temperature
sensors inside them to make this a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next site is Apogee's backyard which is a
more extensive test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all these along a plane here's
replicate Apogee shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the MetOne shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the RM Young shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many replicate shields in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in a line but we filtered the data
for only when it was crosswinds to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more precise data out of this test.
[SPEAKER_00]: All run off a single weather station.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of some of the testing
we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third site is Campbell Scientific England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here's the RM Young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole bunch of static shields in this
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: All hooked up to a common data log or run
over a long period of time to test for
[SPEAKER_00]: differences among shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another site is the Utah State University
campus environmental observatory which is
[SPEAKER_00]: a solar powered station right in the
middle of campus and here's a static
[SPEAKER_00]: shield and here's an Apogee shield in
comparison in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we have the inlet of these at
the exact same height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not quite that way here because
the ground is warm and the higher you go
[SPEAKER_00]: the cooler it is so this test would
slightly favor the static shield over this
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is lower and this is higher
but typically in all the other tests the
[SPEAKER_00]: inlets were at the exact same height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at some of the data from
these tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to summarize a lot of data in
a few slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the raw data, these two slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the summarized data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the summarized data first
with all these data points in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the temperature rise above the
active radiation shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all three of the active shields were
very close to each other so they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: close to zero and if the wind is blowing,
now let's look at two things here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: small thermistor right here, the blue
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a larger humidity probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do people measure temperature in
these?
[SPEAKER_00]: A humidity probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a larger humidity probe you
can have 1 degree C errors in still wind
[SPEAKER_00]: if the sun is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the wind is three meters a second,
a gentle breeze, you still have you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see about 0.3 degrees C error all the way
up to a rigorous breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flags would be standing straight out at
wind speeds like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still didn't, the humidity probe still
didn't get quite to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the small thermistor was better and
let's see here if we can erase some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our new board just like the
blackboard only no chalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we go to this, get back to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at this small thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much better because it's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tiny yellow bead thermistor made
by Apogee Instruments, very tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this, at three meters a second now
the error gets less than a tenth of degree
[SPEAKER_00]: C but it's a pretty big error below that
and finally this gets very close to zero
[SPEAKER_00]: out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at high wind speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the raw data because these
are short time intervals, there's little
[SPEAKER_00]: puffs of wind but the key is that summary
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small thermistors are more accurate than
larger humidity sensors and we'll get back
[SPEAKER_00]: to that but that's a key distinction
because people often just use the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor to measure these and they use it in
a static shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the next data look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is differences in the static shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the RM Young shield which is a
very widely used shield on weather
[SPEAKER_00]: stations that had the greatest temperature
increases in our tests, greater increases
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the Metzbeck shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metzbeck has two models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the one shown in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the two shown in blue that MK1 was
slightly better but still they didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: down to zero until there was a reasonable
breeze blowing to cool it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three show the raw data all feeding
into this summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shields vary a little bit but even the
best shields had errors in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens in the winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter is a killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's snow in the ground, there's
low-angle light reflecting up on these
[SPEAKER_00]: shields so that radiation intensity is
focused on the shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not designed to block low-angle
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the shields have a design that
looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when the Sun comes in like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It heats it up, gets right inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the data for no snow in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is over vegetative surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the Sun comes out the errors start to
approach 2 degrees C with no wind and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go to zero until we get a very stiff
breeze blowing on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the errors are much worse over snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look now at the small
differences between these three types of
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirated shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the RM Young shield and the
Apogee shield compared to the MET1 shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in our tests the MET1 shield read
slightly cooler so we use that as the
[SPEAKER_00]: reference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no official reference for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: At zero things heat up as the radiation
gets bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's temperature errors in the summer
and they're less than 0.05 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee shield was slightly better than
the RM Young shield for accuracy in these
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now look at the winter, much worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember the static shields were more
than 1 degree C above air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've reduced that error to less than
0.1 degrees C even in the winter with the
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course when it's dark there's no
error at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all close.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee shield in these tests
outperformed the RM Young shield and was
[SPEAKER_00]: very close to the MET1 shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this Apogee shield work?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the design goals of this was to
dramatically reduce the power to the
[SPEAKER_00]: shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's take a side view look at this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're going to run these from
a solar powered system you either need an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous solar panel or a more efficient
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Apogee design right here in
side view filled with foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensor port adapter right here going to
the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is what's called a Kiwanda inlet
and it looks like a jet engine inlet so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when the wind is blowing sideways it
can more easily change direction and go up
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the fan and blow out the top of
the shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was a square edge like it was in
all of our early tests, anytime there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a crosswind we had problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to go to this specialized
Kiwanda inlet coupled with a small sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: in just the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the taper here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a rocket nozzle contour to get the
wind going faster and faster over this
[SPEAKER_00]: shield right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all critical to the design and
critical to the use of a small fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the whole thing sealed up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's G-Loy plastic venturi contour inlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we're here let me show you some
of the component parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an IP55 rated fan that's custom
built for Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: IP55 is a measure of the resistance to
water and dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray this fan with water and it
doesn't hurt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have yet to have, in spite of now
having several hundred of these in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field in very rugged environments,
we have yet to ever have a fan fail and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them have been up for four years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rated for at least 50,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an exceptionally rugged small
low-power fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Kiwanda radius, we got it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Kiwanda radius so the air can
come right up in here and fan sits right
[SPEAKER_00]: in here and blow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this whole thing is covered by a hat
so that we can shield it from the sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: water and it's a simple yet elegant
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at some performance
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Kiwanda.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the difference in fan size.
[SPEAKER_00]: RM Young 400 milliamp, Apogee 80 milliamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a five-fold reduction in power for
the fan so much smaller battery,
[SPEAKER_00]: much smaller solar panel, it gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night you don't need to run the fan
full blast so Apogee has put in a variable
[SPEAKER_00]: speed fan which I'm going to talk about in
the next slide but this is the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Kiwanda radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the wind is blowing sideways the RM
Young got worse and because of that radius
[SPEAKER_00]: the Apogee gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slightly better with high wind in
spite of a five-fold reduction in speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at the variable speed fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is running full blast 80 milliamps
with the ratio of 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night or on cloudy days with a PWM
command we can slow the fan down all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to 25 milliamps and now the wind speed
is less but the power consumption is much
[SPEAKER_00]: less so it's already a small fan and we
can further optimize it by slowing it down
[SPEAKER_00]: at night and on cloudy days or on days
when the wind is already high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't need a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the IP 55 rating tachometer output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a separate wire to the data
logger telling the RPMs of this fan if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything gets in there and the fans not
working right we'll slow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show up and raise a red flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we save power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulse width modulation from the data
acquisition system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a top view with a fan right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get the sensors in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other shields are there big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them in from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clamp them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: After lots of testing we found the best
way is put them in the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensors go right in the side like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change takeout sensors and change
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put in multiple sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a bunch of pictures of what we call
sensor port adapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need one thermistor this is the
sensor of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to have replicates there's two
replicates, three replicates, four
[SPEAKER_00]: replicates thermistors for super precision
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cheap and easy to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what if you want a humidity probe with
it like everybody does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy the model with a humidity probe
adapter and that looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of that adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clips right in here quarter turn snaps
into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: O-rings to hold the humidity probe in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these come in all shapes and sizes to
hold a wide range of sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a picture of one in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would sit like this in the shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air is coming up like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We accurately measure the temperature
there and then the humidity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Viseva HMP 110 shown with how
this would go right into the adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is easy to do for a wide range of
sensors and they're easy to take out and
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These eventually get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other shields you have to take a whole
shield apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you just pop the sensors out,
wipe them clean, put them right back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another design.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of that in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the air temperature options
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee ST110 is that yellow bead
thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now many places call for more precise data
with the platinum resistance thermometer
[SPEAKER_00]: and here is an example of that with the
four wire PRT in that sensor port adapter
[SPEAKER_00]: for places that require PRT accuracy
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another probe that works fine with
it, the Campbell Scientific 109.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wide range of temperature sensors work
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visela, Campbell Scientific, Rotronics,
EE Electronics, it works fine with a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range of sensors just with the right
sensor port adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course many people buy more than one
sensor port adapter for future expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple case studies in the field
where this has been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's called the iUtah project
and they use a lowercase i to be
[SPEAKER_00]: high-tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many of these stations in the
mountains of Utah monitoring snowmelt
[SPEAKER_00]: where accuracy of air temperature is
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast is the snowmelt in the spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast is the water run down in the
valley?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're off a tenth of a degree C the
models are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Apogee shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This by the way is an Apogee heated
pyranometer which they've selected for use
[SPEAKER_00]: on this for extreme winter conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up in the mountains the snow gets deep so
this stuff has to be high up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more example is a greenhouse
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one happens to be Roberto Lopez's
greenhouse at Purdue University.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ordered multiple Apogee sensors for
precision air temperature measurement over
[SPEAKER_00]: his experimental plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here they are with the precision
thermistor coming out and the shields,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple replicate shields hanging in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary the Apogee shield has been
optimized for accuracy and low power and
[SPEAKER_00]: low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three things we think make it a very
favorable choice for weather stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When precision air temperature
measurements are important this can
[SPEAKER_00]: replace the old static shields for
precision air temperature measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the final slide in the shield
measurement series.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to see you again another
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you you
