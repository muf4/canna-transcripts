[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Mark Blonquist, a scientist at
Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to talk today about a relatively
new product at Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new thermopile pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model number is SP510.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I talk about the specifics of
the sensor, I want to talk a bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation for creating a new thermopile
sensor as Apogee has traditionally
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured and marketed silicon cell
pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some data here, three different
plots on the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis is wavelength from about 300
to 2500 nanometers and on the y-axis is
[SPEAKER_00]: either normalized or radiance or spectral
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red data set is a clear sky solar
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue data set is an overcast sky solar
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these data sets are normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black data set is the spectral
sensitivity of a silicon cell pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon is sensitive from about 350 to
1,100 nanometers, so it captures much of
[SPEAKER_00]: the radiation coming from the sun,
but it's not sensitive to the wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: out here beyond 1,100 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go from clear sky to overcast sky
conditions, often that's where the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in the spectrum occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a silicon cell sensor is calibrated
to measure accurately under clear skies,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the sky gets cloudier and cloudier,
this can introduce errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have these three pieces of
information, the clear sky spectrum and
[SPEAKER_00]: overcast sky spectrum and the spectral
response of the sensor, we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: predict what the error will be assuming
calibration to one of the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we assume calibration to the clear
sky spectrum, the theoretical error
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction for the overcast sky spectrum
is about 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this means in practice is shown in
these data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have two consecutive days.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is from September of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black plot, if you can see it
underneath the red one there, are
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements from a secondary standard
black body thermopile pyranometer on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooftop of the Apogee building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the red plot is data from an Apogee
SP110 silicon cell pyranometer mounted
[SPEAKER_00]: next to the secondary standard,
also on the rooftop of the Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we calculate the error on a daily
total basis, the silicon cell matched the
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: No error on the clear sky day.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the cloudy day, however, there was
about an 8% error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the percent differences in
this lower plot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are 15-minute averages then compared
relative to the secondary standard to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide an error measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these data, as I mentioned,
were collected with an Apogee SP110
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon cell pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would find similar results for any
silicon cell pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because the limited spectral
sensitivity of silicon, as we mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: and showed on the previous slide,
silicon is only sensitive from 350 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,100 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not capturing all the changes in
the solar spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon cell sensors traditionally have
been quite popular because of their low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do work relatively well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as people understand that these
errors exist when going from clear sky to
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudy conditions, silicon cells can be
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often found in state mesonet
networks, for example, or in plane of
[SPEAKER_00]: array measurements for solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Apogee, we've often tried to
maximize performance and minimize price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our real goal in building the new
thermopile pyranometer, the SP510,
[SPEAKER_00]: was to make something that improved upon
these cloudy or overcast sky errors with
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon cell sensors, but still kept the
price similar to silicon cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have one here to display.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's small, compact,
and similarly shaped to the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee silicon cell sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: To show you how it performs, we actually
have data for an Apogee SP510 for the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same two days that we showed for the
silicon cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we compare daily total
errors, we get no error on the clear day
[SPEAKER_00]: and minimal error on the cloudy day,
only about 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see down here that the
15-minute periods, the errors are much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller for the thermopile sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea of some more of
the features and performance of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular model, we've had seven
replicates of the SP510, some prototype
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors that have been deployed
continuously on our rooftop for three and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been comparing them to secondary
standard pyranometer all of the seven
[SPEAKER_00]: replicates have been stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them have changed by more than 1%
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the features, it has a low thermal
offset, less than five watts per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared, because it doesn't have the
traditional glass dome of a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: thermopile sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a diffuser more like a silicon
cell, and we can better thermally bond
[SPEAKER_00]: that to the thermopile detector itself,
and it reduces the thermal offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the SP510s come with internal
heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be controlled by the user,
so the heater is optional, but the heater
[SPEAKER_00]: can certainly reduce error caused by
precipitation, dew, and frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, as I mentioned previously,
we've targeted low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're offering this particular sensor at
only 30% more than the standard Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon cell heated model, the SP230.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the new thermopile pyranometer from
Apogee Instruments is really targeting
[SPEAKER_00]: markets where silicon cell pyranometers
have been traditionally used, but where
[SPEAKER_00]: higher accuracy is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, any application where thermopile
pyranometers have been used in ISO
[SPEAKER_00]: classification is not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the opportunity to present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
