[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee and in this video I want
to talk about our research over especially
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last 10 years and even over the
last 20 years of the effects of colors of
[SPEAKER_00]: light on photosynthesis and plant shape
and I'm calling this towards an optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral quality for plant growth and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we mean by plant growth and
development?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say plant growth, we mean an
increase in dry weight of the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: that directly comes from photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say development, we mostly mean
plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a tall skinny plant, the short fat
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see you could have the same size
plant with very different shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectral quality has an effect on
photosynthesis but it has a much bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on plant shape and most of the time
when we're changing ratios of colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing it to affect plant shape and
I'll walk through this, both plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant shape varies among species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different species have different responses
to spectral quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis does not vary among species
much at all but you will see there's
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that our historic definition of
photosynthetic photons is now coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I first want to acknowledge NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have funded my laboratory now for
over 30 years and that has allowed us to
[SPEAKER_00]: do some very basic research on spectral
quality on photosynthesis and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also recently got a grant from the
USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's through the University of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called the LAMP project,
Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a more applied project to look at
spectral quality and plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big implications for supplemental lighting
in greenhouses, big implications for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor agriculture and vertical farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge two people that in
the trenches at this time did the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shu-Yang Zhen, a postdoctoral fellow and
now a research scientist in my lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Kusuma, a PhD candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came from the University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work I'm showing you is largely done
by these two young scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about what things affect plant
growth and we talk about nine cardinal
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters and here they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, humidity, roots on
temperature, nutrients, oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: wind, CO2 and light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parameter right here on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we're working to optimize
these to use the given light that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: and for generations we haven't been able
to change the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just optimize what we get from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we can change the light,
boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This we change and then we re-optimize
everything depending on the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you increase the light, it increases
the flux of water through the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: that automatically changes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes the nutrient solution ratio
that makes more respiration and need more
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a lot more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that CO2 becomes cost-effective
to elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature and humidity are higher so we
need more wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide summarizes something like 30
years of photobiology for me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four categories of light in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue photons inhibit cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that sounds terrible but if it's stem
elongation, blue photons are terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep plants shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very variability among plants
but this inhibition of stem elongation
[SPEAKER_00]: means shorter plants and that's a huge
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also means reduced leaf expansion which
is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 5% blue right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 5% blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how tall that is and we increase
the blue to 20 and the height of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the power of blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two plants by the way are young
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're medical hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one of the few universities in the
United States with the license to study
[SPEAKER_00]: medical hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing research on hemp along with
the many many food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green photons facilitate human vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're primarily important so we can
diagnose subtle nutritional disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an old Chinese phrase that says
the best fertilizer is the footsteps of
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer and green photons are like
fertilizer because we can see the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and diagnose problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early days of LEDs there was a
misperception that green photons were not
[SPEAKER_00]: used efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made LEDs with blue and red photons and
that led to lots of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have purple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately those types of LEDs are
diminishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting a lot more white LEDs in our
fixtures to get the green photons so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red photons are terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're efficient photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're efficient LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like the potato of the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a lot of red photons to drive
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though all of these drive
photosynthesis, red photons are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 15% better than blue photons
for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, new kid on the block,
far-red photons enhance cell division so
[SPEAKER_00]: they counteract the blue in the same way
that blue photons make them shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring in the reds to make them tall
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the middle categories here,
green and red, are doing their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the background light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biologically active colors are blues
and far-reds because we can shrink and
[SPEAKER_00]: swell stems in this business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at green photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's green lettuce under
blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's seen graphs like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are magenta colored LEDs,
but very hard to see the plants in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a closer look at all of these
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a little bit of a small
picture, but this is white light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study, Paul Kasuma added 10% of
the photons as far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like magic to lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dramatically improve cell expansion,
and we got a much bigger lettuce plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for lettuce production, far-red is a
very powerful color of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it stops with lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most other species, we add far-red and we
get tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unfortunate, but the nature of
far-red is still a powerful tool to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a summary of these colors of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's take a look at how much they
penetrate leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is absorbed heavily by chlorophyll A
and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a leaf right here, the top and
bottom of a leaf, and it's absorbed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: top layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare that to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It penetrates the leaf all the way to the
bottom, lights up the sponge you managed
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrific for its penetrating power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red is just like blue, absorbed in the
very top layer of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't penetrate nearly as well as
green, and finally far-red penetrates even
[SPEAKER_00]: better than green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes deep into the leaf, and that's a
good thing for the cases of leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from this paper right here,
Brodersen and Vogelmann.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nice images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added the far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't study far-red, but these are
nice side views of a leaf with penetration
[SPEAKER_00]: of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at efficiency of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our primary colors that we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do efficiency, which is watts of
photosynthetic photons out per watt of
[SPEAKER_00]: electric energy in, that's efficiency
because the units in the denominator and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the numerator and the denominator are
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue chips, not fixtures yet, just the
chips, 88% efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible how far blues have come.
[SPEAKER_00]: White LEDs are a phosphor-converted blue,
and we can get pretty good phosphors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but white is a little bit less than the
blues, 80%, and then the reds and the
[SPEAKER_00]: far-reds are slightly less efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is efficiency, but we know that
watts of energy doesn't cause
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photons cause photosynthesis, so this
column is micromoles of photons per joule
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy, and these are the peak numbers
we get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are staggeringly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most high-pressure sodium on this comes in
at about, I'm going to put it down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: high-pressure sodium comes in at 1.7,
maybe 1.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are approaching twice the efficiency,
LED chips, not the fixtures yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's review this a second because this is
very confusing to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is is micromoles of photons per
second divided by joules of electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: per second, and you can see how this
simplifies to micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: A joule per second is a watt, so we can
say micromoles per second per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same thing here, but the key
here is that the numerator is moles of
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, the denominator is electric
energy or electric power.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is power to power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is good news for the future
because eventually these LEDs make their
[SPEAKER_00]: way into fixtures, and we can do great
things with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one more column.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in that third column?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the price of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it cost to buy these?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool whites are mass-produced because
of human lighting, in large quantities,
[SPEAKER_00]: so their prices drop significantly
compared to these other colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the relative price, 1x for white
LEDs, 10x for the reds, and the blues and
[SPEAKER_00]: the far reds are still 30x.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an inherent problem,
it's just economy of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we make more and more and more of
these, by the millions, these prices will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep coming down, and LEDs will get more
cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at a few spectral effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to harvest, we did a study with blue
fraction on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for those of you that know blue
fractions, this was high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these, they're all white LEDs with
different fractions of blue, and we ramped
[SPEAKER_00]: it all the way from 4% all the way up to
20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this case, there was no difference
on height because we grew them
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetatively in the same environment and
moved them into this at flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the flower yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: No difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there's a trend and it goes
back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the standard deviations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no difference in yield at all
among these treatments, indicating that
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthesis was similar in all
these treatments and the partitioning to
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers was similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an amazing slide because there is
a lot of people that really feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: colors of light are just magic to cannabis
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need just the right colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't prove there'll never be a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in this carefully done study
where all the plants were in one big room
[SPEAKER_00]: and had the same air, the same humidity,
the same CO2, we didn't see a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the cannabinoids in the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely this bust of blue must have done
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next slide is cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the flowers at harvest,
same thing, 4-20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were medical hemp so they have
mostly CBD but some THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the THC, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6,
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no effect of colors of light and
ratios of colors and especially blue on
[SPEAKER_00]: THC production and there was no effect on
CBD either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the choice of lamp for lighting
cannabis should be based on the economics
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lights, not on the proposed
hypothesized differences in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis and yield of the flowers,
at least according to this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're replicating this study now but it's
a significant finding for this and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: still not recommending any particular
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying the LEDs were no better
than the HPS, they were no worse than HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we did yield per kilowatt
hour, these LEDs would win.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more efficient than the high
pressure sodium because the light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity, the photosynthetic photon flux
was kept exactly equal in this study and
[SPEAKER_00]: it took more energy to make the photons
for high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this treatment, I'll draw it right
here, here's a high pressure sodium lamp
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a lot of thermal radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's concentrated a thousand watts in a
small area so to make the thermal
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation the same, we put a piece of
tempered glass below the light and that
[SPEAKER_00]: blocked even more of the light but it made
the thermal radiation more similar among
[SPEAKER_00]: these treatments because we didn't want to
get differences in this treatment by
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also studying the edges of
photosynthetic radiation and these are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple final slides on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our classic curve, this is 400 to
700 which we always say is photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This in here is, we call it PAR,
photosynthetic radiation and more
[SPEAKER_00]: precisely PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at that sharp cutoff,
right at 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: A photon at 699 is valuable and one at
700, one is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's not sharp, we've just
approximated it for years because it tilts
[SPEAKER_00]: like this but we now have a very efficient
far-red LED and it peaks at 730,
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have studied that LED for far-red and
those photons are photosynthetically
[SPEAKER_00]: active so we need to rethink our
definition of photosynthesis with this in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not directly photosynthetic,
they're synergistic with these shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths in here and when they're
coupled together they're synergistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was discovered in the 1950s by
Emerson and it's called the Emerson
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancement effect but it was not there
for half a century and we didn't study it
[SPEAKER_00]: until now that we have far-red LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a close look at the value of
far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the spectrum,
UV photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a sharp cutoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well are these UV photons used?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next two slides show some of our work
on UV photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's why those edges are so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the photon flux of these
colors, we have a violet LED that peaks
[SPEAKER_00]: right at 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we effectively use that for
photosynthesis and get a lot of the value
[SPEAKER_00]: of UV blue LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the one at 730, here's 700 right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the 730 LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we use that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out we can for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about this one and what about
wavelengths in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You often see pictures of LEDs showing the
energy flux and an energy basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are lower than these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most efficient is blue but that's not
what drives photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we graph this same data by photons,
the reds and the blues are virtually
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tremendous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a paper that we recently got
published in the journal Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs for photons, physiology, and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It analyzes in this paper the economics of
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the very famous McCree curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of Keith McCree as a
young scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He died just a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a long and distinguished career.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a physicist that came across the
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, oh my, these biologists need
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought an excellent physics background
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is his curve, how the colors of light
cause photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the McCree curve now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, let's call it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cut this off at 400 and 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our data indicates that this curve should
shift over here some like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the synergism of far red,
it shifts that curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This curve also tilts and these photons
just below 400 are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you carefully read McCree's
papers, there's 700, there's 400,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph is exactly the same as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just graphed a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 400 and 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bars right here were the range of
species from his paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: My students and I made this graph from his
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was very little variability among
species in his data, but what people
[SPEAKER_00]: forget is that he also, in addition to
taking plants from the field, he took
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from a growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew them in a growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these photons right here are
almost as good as red and they're close to
[SPEAKER_00]: UV photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an enormous range of variability
among species in McCree's trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're re-examining this part of the
curve right now, particularly with violet
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, which are just right here on the
edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hypothesis is that the field-grown
plants synthesize compounds to block UV,
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect themselves, and once they
synthesize those, the UV photons were not
[SPEAKER_00]: effective in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those compounds are made in the cuticle,
but the growth chamber plants that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see UV didn't make the compounds and now
the UV photons are valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a cutting edge of the research
we're doing on photobiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop here and I will pick
this up in another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
