[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Ben Crabb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do technical sales and support here at
Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about a tool that we put
together to help our users of quantum or
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR sensors to get more accurate
measurements under a variety of lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: sources and correct for the spectral
errors that may occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a little examination of the
quantum sensors that Apogee carries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carry two basic varieties of quantum
sensor, our original quantums and our full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum quantums.
[SPEAKER_00]: The originals came out a number of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a low-cost option that produce
very accurate measurements under broad
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their spectral response drops off a little
bit in the red range and the blue range,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are an excellent choice for most
lighting conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tool that we'll go over momentarily is
most applicable to these original
[SPEAKER_00]: quantums.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full spectrum quantum has a response
that more closely approximate the PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: response, which is four to seven hundred
nanometers, which has been developed
[SPEAKER_00]: defined as the wavelengths of light that
plants can use for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a look at the spectral
responses of those two types of quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors as well as the PAR response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PAR response being shown by this black
dotted line and the original quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: response being in the thick black line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that drops off in the red
range out here from 655 to 700 and it
[SPEAKER_00]: drops off a little bit in the blue range
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your light emits a lot of light in
those portions of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the original quantum is going to read a
little bit low, erroneously low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full spectrum response is indicated by
this gold line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that it nearly approximates,
very nicely approximates the dashed black
[SPEAKER_00]: line of the official PAR response and so
it's going to provide very accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements under any lighting
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move to the tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the page for the tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will include this URL in the comment
section down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's scroll down and examine it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pretty easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it works is you just select your
sensor and your light source and this
[SPEAKER_00]: display will update.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green line indicates the spectral
response of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red line indicates the output of the
light and the dashed black line indicates
[SPEAKER_00]: the official or the defined PAR response,
which is four to seven hundred nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we select the different sensor
options, we have two different original
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one's been calibrated read most
accurately under sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other's been calibrated read most
accurately under T5 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our SQ500, which is one
of our full spectrum quantum sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to read accurately under any
lighting conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an example, what we have selected
here is clear sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the lighting spectrum that would
be expected on a clear sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that our sun calibrated SQ110
original quantum sensor, the expected air
[SPEAKER_00]: on this guy, let's let's unclick this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our expected air on this guy is zero
percent and the correction factor being
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.00.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just means you take your reading from
your SQ110, you multiply it by the
[SPEAKER_00]: correction factor, in this case 1.00,
and you get a more accurate PAR reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in this particular instance,
multiplying by one, you get the same
[SPEAKER_00]: reading because it's already very
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had used this electric
calibrated sensor, original quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor, it's the same technology,
the same sensing technology, but it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated to read accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: under T5 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you take it out in full sun,
you measure PAR, and you get a reading
[SPEAKER_00]: that is about 14% lower than it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tool says apply a correction factor
of 1.16.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take your reading from your SQ120,
you multiply it by 1.16, and you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: much more accurate PAR reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the way the tool works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can scroll through the different
preloaded lighting spectra we have in this
[SPEAKER_00]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the arrow keys on your
keyboard to go through it quickly if you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this little rectangle up here will be
color-coded yellow if the air is between 5
[SPEAKER_00]: and 10%, and red if it's expected to be
more than 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll show those correction factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to note is that with LEDs,
which emit a lot of their light in very
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow spectral ranges, if you use a deep
red LED, so the one we have displayed here
[SPEAKER_00]: is a deep red LED with a 668 nanometer
peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is sort of outside of the range
of highest spectral sensitivity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original quantums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original quantum sensor just does
not pick up much of that light very
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's reading, I mean, this one says
the expected air is negative 65%,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's going to be very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can apply that correction factor,
but do it with caution because if the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor is not detecting much of the light
and you try and correct that, you may not
[SPEAKER_00]: get a really reliable reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be better to get a higher quality
sensor such as a full spectrum quantum.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple other things to note on this tool
is we have this checkbox down here to show
[SPEAKER_00]: correction factor for underwater
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is useful for people who like to
measure par in their aquariums,
[SPEAKER_00]: for corals and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you select this, the display will
update and it will show the expected air
[SPEAKER_00]: in air and the expected air in water and
correction factors for both situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a final functionality of
this tool you can upload your own custom
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting spectra or, you know,
if you don't find your lights on the list
[SPEAKER_00]: here or you know your spectra,
the spectrum of your light is different
[SPEAKER_00]: than what we have loaded here,
you can upload your own data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just click this browse button and you
navigate to the CSV file on your machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It expects the first column to be
wavelength expressed in nanometers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: second column to be the light output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, then you just select
the custom data from CSV file under the
[SPEAKER_00]: light source and the display will update.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we haven't uploaded any
light data and so it says upload some
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, what else do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tool is under development.
