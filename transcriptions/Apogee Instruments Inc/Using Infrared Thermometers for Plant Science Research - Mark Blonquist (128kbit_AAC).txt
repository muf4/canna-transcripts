[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Mark Blonquist from Apogee
Instruments in Logan, Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to speak about plant canopy
water status estimation from canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before getting that far, I'm going to
spend a fair amount of time talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: actually measuring surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide provides a brief outline of
where the presentation is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'll talk about infrared
radiometers, their operation in
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration, and then surface temperature
measurements, specifically correcting for
[SPEAKER_00]: surface emissivity and field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also deal with the challenge of
partial canopy cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two methods I'll talk about to handle
that are angling radiometers and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: model to account for soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we'll get to estimating
canopy water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll spend some time with the simpler
method, the Crop Water Stress Index,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a more involved method,
Canopy Stomodal Conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic components of an infrared
radiometer are the radiation detector
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, an internal temperature sensor to
provide a temperature measurement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: detector, and then a housing to hold it
all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The signal generated by the radiation
detector is proportional to the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between the radiation being absorbed by
the detector and also the radiation being
[SPEAKER_00]: emitted by the detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: All surfaces or objects that have a
temperature above absolute zero emit
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The detector and the radiometer is
absorbing the radiation that's emitted
[SPEAKER_00]: towards it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, the detector is emitting
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the signal will be dependent on the
difference between these two radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the absorbed radiation at the
detector is less than the emitted
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, the signal is negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the absorbed radiation at the
detector is greater than the emitted
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, the signal is positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sensor is actually measuring or
detecting radiation, but temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: the quantity that we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they're related through the
Stefan-Boltzmann law, where energy is
[SPEAKER_00]: proportional to a constant times the
fourth power of temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important component and essential
component of the radiation detector itself
[SPEAKER_00]: is a filter to block all wavelengths
outside of what we call the atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plot you're looking at here shows
wavelength on the x-axis and atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: transmittance on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wavelengths between 8 and 14 micron or
micrometers is defined as the atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: window because at these wavelengths,
the transmission of the atmosphere is very
[SPEAKER_00]: near one, meaning the atmosphere is
transparent like a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: The filter on the radiation detector needs
to closely correspond to the atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: window to eliminate influence from the
atmosphere or essentially see through the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere to the surface that we're
interested in measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below 8 micron, we can have interference
from water vapor and above 14 micron,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can have interference from CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final component that's essential for
infrared radiometer is the calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo that you're viewing now is a
picture of the calibration system at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I've circled here is the
actual cap piece where all the radiometers
[SPEAKER_00]: are held during the calibration procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cap piece is mounted on top of this
piece here, which is the actual black body
[SPEAKER_00]: cone or radiation source.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens during calibration is the
radiometers are mounted in the cap piece
[SPEAKER_00]: over top of the cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some insulation around the
cone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the two independent pieces,
the cap and the cone piece, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain their temperatures independent of
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can collect a whole data set
across a whole range of temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the calibration procedure,
we also collect the millivolt signals from
[SPEAKER_00]: the radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a large data set that we can
then use to derive custom coefficients for
[SPEAKER_00]: all radiometers that allow us to convert
the signal, which again from the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: slide was proportional to the radiation
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can convert that to a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have a calibrated radiometer
already deployed in the field and start
[SPEAKER_00]: making measurements, surface temperature
measurements are pretty straightforward
[SPEAKER_00]: when the surface is a black body.
[SPEAKER_00]: A black body is defined as any object or
material that emits the theoretical
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum amount of radiation based on its
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we define it as an object or material
with an emissivity equal to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where emissivity is just the fraction of
black body emission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I have a plant canopy with
emissivity equal to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that scenario, the target temperature
returned by the radiometer would equal the
[SPEAKER_00]: true surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in practice, natural surfaces are not
black bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plant canopies have emissivity is
equal to 0.98 or 0.99.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is the plant canopy will
be emitting 98 or 99% of the theoretical
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum based on temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be a small fraction of
background radiation that's directed
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the radiometer because it's
reflected from the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surface reflectance is equal to one
minus the emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in our case it would be one minus 0.98.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what this means is if we
deploy a radiometer to measure a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy in an outdoor environment,
the background is the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sky is emitting infrared radiation
just like the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where the plant canopy is not a
perfect black body with an emissivity
[SPEAKER_00]: equal to one, a smaller fraction,
one minus the emissivity of the background
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, in this case coming from the
sky, is reflected from the plant canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: and directed towards the radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the sky temperature and the
surface temperature are much different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to account for this reflected
fraction in order to get accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement of the surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do so, we need an estimate or
measurement of the surface emissivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: an estimate or measurement of the
radiation coming from the sky in addition
[SPEAKER_00]: to our measurement of the surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to go through the
derivation of the equation to correct for
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity, but I'm showing it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take our measurement of target
temperature and we input it along with our
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement or estimate of emissivity and
our measurement or estimate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: background temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can calculate the actual or true
surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea of the magnitude of
effective emissivity, I have a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: simple examples, one for a clear day and
one for a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's assume that our sensor is
measuring a temperature of 25 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pretty standard background temperature
or sky temperature for a clear day would
[SPEAKER_00]: be negative 40 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, our canopy emissivity is .98 and
when we plug all those numbers into the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation above, we get a surface
temperature almost a full degree warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: than the temperature we measure with the
radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a cloudy day, the background
temperature is much warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot closer to the actual measured
surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we plug the numbers into our equation
above for a cloudy day, we find that the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature is much closer to the
measured temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a table listing emissivities
for several different surfaces one would
[SPEAKER_00]: encounter in natural settings,
plants, soils, water and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that most natural surfaces are
near black bodies with emissivities in the
[SPEAKER_00]: .9 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find some things that are very,
very low emissivity like polished
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have at the bottom of the slide
some typical values for the background
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature or the sky temperatures in an
environmental application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear sky is often very cold, negative 40
to negative 60 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overcast sky is often near air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also listed a simple equation that
you can use to calculate sky temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approximated from the air temperature
where we take air temperature plus 50
[SPEAKER_00]: times the fraction of clouds minus 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a clear day, our fraction of clouds
would be zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: This equation would simplify to air
temperature minus 60 is equal to the sky
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a completely overcast day, our fraction
of clouds would be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This equation would simplify to air
temperature minus 10 would be equal to sky
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature on an overcast day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be used for a simple way to
approximate sky temperature views with
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on from emissivity, another
important consideration is the area of
[SPEAKER_00]: surface that the radiometer actually views
or in other words the field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to draw an analogy whenever I
explain field of view of an infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best analogy that I can think of is
put yourself in front of a flat wall in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dark room with a flashlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hold the flashlight perpendicular
to the wall and turn on the flashlight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see a circle of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you move the flashlight closer to the
wall, the circle gets smaller and as you
[SPEAKER_00]: move the flashlight away from the wall,
the circle gets larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start to angle that flashlight so
it's no longer perpendicular to the wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the circle of light spreads out into
an ellipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same principle holds for a radiometer
that you direct towards a surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the radiometer is oriented
perpendicular to the surface, then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to view or sense a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the radiometer is close to the surface,
it will be a small circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the radiometer is moved further from
the surface, it will be a larger circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start angling it away from the
surface perpendicular, it will view an
[SPEAKER_00]: ellipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The area that being measured or sensed by
the radiometer is dependent on three
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field of view, the radiometer mounting
height, and the radiometer mounting angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the field of view is just defined as
the angle or half angle of the cone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: formed by the footprint that the
radiometer sees and then the apex of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cone here at the aperture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So companies should specify what the field
of view of the radiometer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, it's a 22 degree half
angle or a 44 degree full angle field of
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide shows multiple different models
that are available from Apogee instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: and it lists their fields of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into detail about calculating
the field of view, but one very helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: tool that runs the calculations is found
online, the website here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to plug in in this calculator
are the three things I mentioned on the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field of view specification in terms
of the half angle, the distance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer from the target, and then the
angle of the radiometer with respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the calculator returns the dimensions
of the ground area that the radiometer
[SPEAKER_00]: will be viewing or sensing and also the
area of the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges of measuring plant
canopy temperature with an infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer is the situation where plant
canopy doesn't occupy the entire field of
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shown here in this example, plant canopy
occupies part of the field of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the radiometer is also seeing some
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most situations, the soil temperature
and plant canopy temperature are
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to get an estimate of the
canopy temperature, we have to account for
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil temperature somehow or eliminate
the soil from the field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to deal with this is the angle of
the radiometer such that we maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy within the field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing this is very helpful to rely on the
field of view calculator that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: in the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can provide estimates of the actual
area being sensed by the radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another way to try to estimate plant
canopy temperature when the surface is
[SPEAKER_00]: only partially covered by the canopy is to
actually measure or estimate the soil's
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and then approximate the
fraction of canopy within the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: view of the radiometer and the fraction of
soil within the field of view of the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here again, I won't go through the
derivation of this equation, but we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use this simple relationship with the
measurement of the soil temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate of the fraction of surface that
soil, a fraction of surface that's canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the actual surface temperature
that we measure with the radiometer and
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have a measurement of actual
canopy temperature, we're ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: progress to use that canopy temperature to
estimate canopy water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we go through the two methods
that I mentioned in the introduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about the
theory behind using canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canopy temperature is an indicator of
water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant leaves are actually covered with
small microscopic pores called stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to photosynthesize, plants have
to take up CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomata open in the presence of light in
order to allow CO2 to enter for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: An inevitable trade-off when stomata open
is water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant leaves are saturated with water and
the atmosphere is often dry, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water evaporates out of the stomata
when they're open in order for CO2 uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants uptake soil water to replace the
water being lost through the stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: during photosynthetic uptake of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as plants draw down water in the soil
and soil water becomes limiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant water uptake obviously starts to
decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tends to close stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomato closure reduces the stomato
aperture or the degree of opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this in turn reduces the transpiration
or the evaporation of water from the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evaporation is a cooling process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as stomata close in response to a
drawdown of soil water, plants aren't as
[SPEAKER_00]: cool as they otherwise would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the canopy temperature thereby
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important factors we have
to remember, however, is that soil water
[SPEAKER_00]: status is not the only control on canopy
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canopy temperature by itself is actually a
poor indicator of plant water status
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's multiple factors that
control canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to transpirational cooling,
which is partially controlled by the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: water status, air temperature,
humidity, radiation, and wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the environmental conditions that the
plant is subject to will influence the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to use canopy temperature as a
means of estimating water status,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to account for all of the
variables that can influence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an early method and a rather simple
method for using canopy temperature to
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify water status is called the Crop
Water Stress Index, abbreviated CWSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method was developed by IDSO and
colleagues in 1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the presentation,
I'll provide the full citation for the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper that IDSO and colleagues published.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially they found through their
field data that the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy and air temperature for a
well-watered canopy declined as vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also found that this canopy to air
temperature difference was relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: constant for a canopy experiencing
significant water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they used these two boundaries,
what we're defining as a non-water stress
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline and a water stress baseline,
as sort of reference points to compare
[SPEAKER_00]: actual measurements of canopy and air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the equation that they
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CWSI is the measurement of canopy
minus air temperature minus the non-water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress baseline and divided by the
difference between the water stressed and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-water stress baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the required measurements in order to
apply this empirically based CWSI are
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy temperature, air temperature,
and relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air temperature and humidity are
required to calculate the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to illustrate how the CWSI works,
let's say our measured canopy minus air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature value was zero for a vapor
pressure deficit of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would then calculate the crop water
stress index by taking the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between this measured value and the
non-water stress baseline, which we define
[SPEAKER_00]: as A, and then dividing that by the
difference between the water stress
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline and the non-water stress
baseline, which we define as B.
[SPEAKER_00]: A crop water stress index is just A over
B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in our example, we take our measured
value of canopy minus air temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: zero, subtract off the non-water stress
baseline, and then divide the numerator by
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between the water stress
baseline and non-water stress baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives us a crop water stress
index of 0.46, or approximately halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: between the non-water stress and water
stress baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crop water stress index is actually
designed to output a value of zero when
[SPEAKER_00]: the measured value of canopy to air
temperature falls on top of the non-water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it outputs a value of one when the
measured value of canopy to air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature falls on top of the water
stress baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major advantages of using the
empirical crop water stress index are its
[SPEAKER_00]: simplicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only requires three measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the measurement errors are calibrated
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the baselines are derived from
field measurements, which allows for field
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages are that empirical data
is required to determine the non-water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress and water stress baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have some field collection
data before we start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alternative to this would be finding
crop specific values of the non-water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress and water stress baseline in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another major disadvantage is the
environmental conditions must be similar
[SPEAKER_00]: from one hour to the next if we're going
to compare hourly values of crop water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress index, or from one day to the next
if we're going to compare daily values of
the crop water stress index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being, we said in the previous
slide that multiple factors beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of soil water available for plants
to uptake control canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind speed, radiation, air temperature,
all of these variables will impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy to air temperature difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have significantly different wind
speed, from one day to the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a significantly different radiation
environment from one day to the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: this won't be accounted for in our
baselines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the empirical crop water stress
index error prone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to show how well the crop water stress
index works, I have here 11 days of data
[SPEAKER_00]: collected over a cornfield near North
Platte, Nebraska in the middle of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the upper graph, we're showing the
canopy to air temperature difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the lower graph, we're showing the
crop water stress index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green line is the non-water stress
baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red line is the water stress baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black line is the measured value
of canopy to air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the first couple days,
the crop water stress index is quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it tends to increase over the course
of a few days before dropping back down
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the response going from a value near
0.5 or 0.6 back down to a value near 0 was
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by 20 millimeters of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the crop water stress index behaves how
we would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases as soil water is drawn down
when rainfall falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It responds by decreasing to near 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see near the end of this data set,
it's starting to increase again,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating water stress due to soil water
drawdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more interesting point to make is that
there is within-day variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may represent actual increase in the
crop water stress index over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, or it might indicate variability in
variable environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the empirical crop water
stress index, Jackson and colleagues in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1981 also developed a theoretical or
energy balance based version of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than relying on the empirically
derived baselines, they took all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: equations describing the energy balance
for the plant canopy shown here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: diagram, and they combined them and
rearranged them to solve for the canopy to
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't combine the equations and show the
TC minus TA equation, but what that gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you is a means of calculating the
non-water stress and water stress baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: in real time so that conditions don't
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to be the same from hour
to hour or day to day as required with the
[SPEAKER_00]: empirical crop water stress index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drawback to this more theoretical or
energy balance based version is it
[SPEAKER_00]: requires a lot more data in order to
actually get values of the crop water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to canopy temperature,
air temperature, and relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also have to have a measurement or
estimate of net radiation, a measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: of wind speed, and then measurements or
estimates of canopy height and leaf area
[SPEAKER_00]: index.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say anything more in this
presentation about the theoretical version
[SPEAKER_00]: of the crop water stress index,
but again at the end of the presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll provide the reference to the paper in
which it was derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: A method similar to the energy balance
based version of the crop water stress
[SPEAKER_00]: index is a direct calculation of the plant
canopy still model conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can take the exact same plant canopy
energy balance equations that were used to
[SPEAKER_00]: derive the theoretical crop water stress
index and we can combine them and
[SPEAKER_00]: rearrange them to solve for this term the
plant canopy still model conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still model conductance is actual
quantification of the degree of still
[SPEAKER_00]: model opening or still model conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this calculation of plant canopy still
model conductance has the advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: being a physiological variable that's
directly related to still model aperture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually counts for all variables
influencing canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike the empirical crop water stress
index, it should work well under all
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to demonstrate the calculation of
canopy still model conductance,
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same data set for corn near North
Platte, Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the graph on the top, the black line is
the actual canopy still model conductance
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated from the equation on the
previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green line is a value we're
calling potential canopy still model
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's derived from a leaf level model
scaled up to the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The details are found in the Blonquist et
al paper referenced on the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into the nuts and bolts of the
leaf level model, but I will provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: reference for the paper at the end of this
slideshow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comparison of the actual to potential
canopy still model conductance gives an
[SPEAKER_00]: index of water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the ratio starts out near
one and then declines as the canopy draws
[SPEAKER_00]: down water from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we saw with the crop water
stress index, it dropped to near zero
[SPEAKER_00]: following a rainfall event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio of actual to potential canopy
conductance increases after the rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a couple days being near
one, it starts to decline again as water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress sets back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also like the crop water stress index,
there is some within day variability of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratio of actual to potential canopy
conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide just provides an indication of
how well the calculation of actual canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're showing the values from the
equation compared to potential values
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from a scaled up leaf level model
for all days immediately following
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall for the entire summer from a corn
crop near North Platte, Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we're only showing data for
days immediately following rainfall is we
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect the actual conductance to
closely match the potential conductance
[SPEAKER_00]: under well-watered conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, that's what we find.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data match a one-to-one line
relatively well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some outliers where the actual
conductance is significantly higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's possible these are times when the
canopy is wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we didn't have a wetness
sensor to determine when the canopy was
[SPEAKER_00]: wet and when the canopy was dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to provide some summary in
conclusion, canopy temperatures can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used as a means to determine plant canopy
water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple ways to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've demonstrated a simple and a more
complex method for using canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures to estimate water status.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that both methods were sensitive
to water stress and rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the most important conclusion that I
can make is that in order for the methods
[SPEAKER_00]: to work, canopy temperature measurements
must be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correction for surface emissivity
is significant and should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And field of view must be considered,
especially for conditions of partial
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that canopy is being
measured rather than some mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the references for the papers
that I mentioned during the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much more detail can be found regarding
the three different methods in each paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this presentation was helpful for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the opportunity to be
a part of Dekagon's seminar series,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I thank the audience for their
participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
