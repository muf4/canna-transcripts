[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments and I'd like you in this next
[SPEAKER_00]: couple minutes introduce Apogee's new
four-component net radiometer to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this, here it is, this is something
we've been thinking about for 20 years in
[SPEAKER_00]: my whole career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking about ways to more
accurately measure and model net radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: and then four years ago we started a
project to build an improved net
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been a trivial task but we're
excited to introduce this to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you about a 30-second
review of how we got to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started seven or eight years ago
testing all of the net radiometers
[SPEAKER_00]: available on the market at the time in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of Mark Blonquist,
the chief scientist at Apogee of precision
[SPEAKER_00]: leveling these radiometers, cleaning them,
all to make sure we have good data,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be sure we had it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought triplicates of each of five
types of instruments to evaluate their
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found from this was the two types
of net radiometers that could separately
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the four components of net
radiation were by far the most accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this picture they're shown here as
the Kippen-Zonen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a CNR1 this has now been upgraded
to the CNR4 and the Huxaflux which is here
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we look hard in here you can see
triplicates of all these sensors on this
[SPEAKER_00]: mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran this all summer long collected an
enormous body of research and concluded if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do a good job in net
radiation we need a four component
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this work was published here and you
can pause this and get the paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get it on the Apogee website,
accuracy of net radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does our instrument look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of it and you might think
this is life-size because these
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments have historically been big and
after a lot of work we were able to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the size and weight of this instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're quite proud of being able to do
this because it makes it far easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: mount and to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at what the four
components really mean in this big
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little dome here is for shortwave
radiation which Apogee has spent the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years of the company precisely
measuring shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with the Sun always smiling,
this is shortwave in, you also need to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure shortwave reflected and that's
what this bottom is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two components of the four
then we have longwave radiation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sky coming in here measured here and
longwave radiation from the soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a four component net radiometer for
separate measurements coming out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at the state of the art
for net radiation and this is exemplified
[SPEAKER_00]: by two instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is the Kippen-Zonen CNR4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it has the same component shortwave in
and out, longwave in and out and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Huxaflux NR01 shortwave in and out,
longwave in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These instruments are bigger, heavier,
and more expensive than the newer Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: net radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two other very significant
differences between the Huxaflux and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kippen-Zonen and the Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because net radiometers have a lot of
outputs, they take up a lot of channels on
[SPEAKER_00]: a data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a classic CR1000 data logger made
by Campbell Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we hook either one of these instruments
up to it, we have a bunch of wires that
[SPEAKER_00]: look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at these wires and where
they go on this diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the analog channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have shortwave radiation that comes
into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have shortwave radiation out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is incoming, this is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two more channels, longwave in,
two channels, longwave out, two more
[SPEAKER_00]: channels, now we're out of channels on the
top and we haven't measured the reference
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a platinum resistance thermometer
for the reference and to make accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements of that we need two
differential channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've consumed most of the analog
channels on this instrument and we still
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't measured, we still haven't run the
heater for this to make accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements that need to be heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have H for the heater and that's
two more down here in 12 volts and ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it takes to connect one of
these instruments to the CR1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that extensive network of wires
and the complexity of users getting all
[SPEAKER_00]: those hooked up right and all the
calibration factors, Apogee went to an
[SPEAKER_00]: SDI-12 output for this sensor in which all
of the A to D conversion is done here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the center in the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: One wire with three subcomponents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at where those go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a new version of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee takes up one com port,
one 12 volt, and then one ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the calculations are done here and it
still has individual outputs for the four
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the wiring simpler and greatly
enhances the user interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it doesn't stop there because for
precise measurements you want heated
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee has tiny heaters because it's
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heaters only need to be tiny to keep
frost off of this, to keep dew off of this
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accurate measurements night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that look?
[SPEAKER_00]: You already got a little preview of this
when I showed this, but look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the heated Apogee sensor on one
of our typical winter days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It clears a bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't that take a lot of power?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CNR4
[SPEAKER_00]: which requires, here's the CNR4,
here is the heaters and the fans for the
[SPEAKER_00]: CNR4.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fits on like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much power does this take?
[SPEAKER_00]: This combined unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six watts to keep the CNR4 clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the Huxaflux?
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't have fans, but it has heaters
in here to keep frost from forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Huxaflux, which is the NR01,
that comes in at 1.5 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly drawn to scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the Apogee take?
[SPEAKER_00]: This small thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.74 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can easily be run from a solar panel
in the dead of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without having an enormous battery in a
big solar panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny heaters to keep this free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frost all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not have to be heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why these insulating plastics in
here to heat just the part that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked hard at minimizing the power
consumption of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big advantages are simpler to use,
fewer wires to hook up, less consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the wires on your data line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use those other channels to
measure other things with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much lower power requirements and a small
footprint so it's easier to mount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally all of these are four-way
net radiometers to get the best accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our longer video we talk about
measurements and models of net radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people try to model net radiation
from a single measurement of shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We show in that video and in the
manuscripts that we've published on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the measurements are far superior to
the models.
[SPEAKER_00]: The models, the best models with the best
inputs, are still plus or minus 10% for
[SPEAKER_00]: the accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the world of saving water,
plus or minus 10% is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to overwater 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to underwater 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done all this work to make this
small and low power.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the accuracy compared to the larger
models?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran this instrument for 15 months,
summer, winter, summer, on a weather
[SPEAKER_00]: station over alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell this is Utah because of all
our mountains in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the Rolls-Royce instruments,
the CNR-4 mounted right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you squint, you can see three
apogees on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small, so we had some bird spikes
on here to keep this clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the data come out after 15 months of
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the reference, CNR-4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the three replicate apogees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were thrilled to see this tight line
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look closely at this, you can see
some scatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CNR-4 was not heated and ventilated,
so there was days with dew which caused
[SPEAKER_00]: that to read low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these data in here are caused
by problems with the reference,
[SPEAKER_00]: not by the apogees.
[SPEAKER_00]: These high radiation days where there was
no dew and all three replicate instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: lined up beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we've done to make this
accurate for the user is refine and refine
[SPEAKER_00]: and refine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it good out of the box,
it's stable over many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are excited to get this in your hands
for future measurements, help you make
[SPEAKER_00]: more accurate measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already had numerous instruments out
with users in many places, and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: reports are terrific, and people have been
excited to know when it became available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope you can purchase one soon.
Thanks for listening.
Thanks for listening.
