[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments, and I want to talk in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few minutes about photobiology and
how ratios of colors of light affect both
[SPEAKER_00]: plant shape and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by plant growth we mean
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now many, many papers have been written on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My laboratory at the University has
published extensively on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken many times on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bit like diet and people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the perfect diet for people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, different diets vary for different
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to try and capture the elements
of this very simply to show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with colors and we're going to
start right here with 400 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is roughly the start of human vision
and we're going to go over here to 700
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers and right in the 500,
here's 500, here's 600, and over here
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll put 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the wavelengths associated
with colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we do blue, this is blue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is elementary but it's important to
the understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This out here is red and green right here,
GRN, green.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three primary wavelengths
that drive photosynthesis and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly equal which is why we get
photosynthetic radiation and we say that's
[SPEAKER_00]: equal across here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these colors contribute equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: In truth we know they're not quite equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue is a little less.
[SPEAKER_00]: The curve is something like this for plant
growth but we still count them equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the issue here is not so much plant
growth but plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant shape is what we can manipulate with
colors of light and now we have to add in
[SPEAKER_00]: the far red out here and that's generally
up to 750 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to add in the UV down here
and this is another little edge right here
[SPEAKER_00]: from 350 up to 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes shorter than this but this is
the beneficial UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shorter than this is usually bad but
there's a lot of good effects of UV from
[SPEAKER_00]: 350 to 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, one, two, three, four,
five categories of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most efficient LEDs are reds and
blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a long time we had only reds and
blues and magenta LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have those because these two
colors are efficient but now we know the
[SPEAKER_00]: green photons are just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause excellent photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They penetrate deep into canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good reasons to have some
green in your lights plus these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: photons that humans can see really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want some green in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most efficient LEDs are these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whites have, let's see if I can put
this in blue, have a lot of blue light and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they fluoresce in the green and taper
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can make that go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is generally a white LED and it's a
cool white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool white means it looks very white.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of blue light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most efficient color of white
LEDs is blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the research has gone into these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have come a long ways but here's the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue light causes a little less
photosynthesis but more importantly blue
[SPEAKER_00]: light shrinks plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get all that blue light and you get
a small compact plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's often considered bad but it
depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant at a higher plant density
compact plants can be very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: In indoor agriculture we want short plants
so high blue light is not necessarily bad
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's also a very efficient LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take a cool white LED with high blue
and compact now we can add out here some
[SPEAKER_00]: far red and far red does the exact
opposite of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This expands plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the leaves expand more and it
makes the plants get taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cutting edge of research now is the
combinations of far red and high blue
[SPEAKER_00]: light to shape the plants and we turn the
dials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want short plants, wide plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two primary colors that we
use to shape plants in different ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are efficient LEDs and so are far
red efficient LEDs and so are the whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can rearrange these colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this analysis the greens and the reds
become like filler colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause photosynthesis but they don't
have the power to shape the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue and far red photons have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a concise summary of work in my
laboratory that we're doing to shape
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce is in a unique category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce responds very well to far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It expands the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes rapid growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is terrific but if you give these far
red photons to tomatoes they mostly get
[SPEAKER_00]: taller and that's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most crops respond to far red by getting
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate but lettuce and spinach
and leafy greens respond to far red by
[SPEAKER_00]: growing more leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use far red to counteract blue
for crops like lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to know colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis far red makes it taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue makes it shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is more like tomatoes in this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to be careful not to give too much
far red for cannabis because they get too
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very concise summary of some
of the cutting-edge research and
[SPEAKER_00]: thresholds for light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because far red is so powerful Apogee has
developed a sensor that measures
[SPEAKER_00]: separately this PPFD in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has two detectors and it has a far red
detector out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's two detectors in the same sensor
so you can tune your your growth chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: to optimize it for both colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you
