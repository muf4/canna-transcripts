[SPEAKER_01]: Could cars of the future really be powered
by algae?
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientists at Utah State University in
Logan, Utah seem to think so, and now
[SPEAKER_01]: they've exceeded a world speed record to
prove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the recent time trials at the world
famous Bonneville salt flats, the USU
[SPEAKER_01]: Aggie A-Salt Dragster shocked the crowd as
it raced down the track, powered by a
[SPEAKER_01]: unique fuel synthesized from one of the
world's most plentiful organisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: algae.
[SPEAKER_02]: To accomplish this took the melding of
minds and the support of a world class
[SPEAKER_02]: institution capable of forward thinking
and long term support.
[SPEAKER_02]: We combine cutting edge expertise in
engineering with excellence in
[SPEAKER_02]: biochemistry and agricultural scientists
that were willing to think outside the
[SPEAKER_02]: box.
[SPEAKER_01]: These three elements converged perfectly
at Utah State University and the result
[SPEAKER_01]: made just change the way we all get around
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of using algae as a fuel was born
during the crippling oil shortages of the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1970s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based with the reality of a world running
out of gas, scientists began searching for
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Algae was considered but quickly dismissed
because the science to grow and process it
[SPEAKER_01]: economically did not yet exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really excited about the USU
biofuels.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take CO2 and sunlight and turn it into
completely renewable fuels and we think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a potential game changer because we
can actually use this in existing engines
[SPEAKER_03]: and the tests we've already done have
shown that it works just as well as the
[SPEAKER_03]: renewable fuels like biodiesel and
soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the biofuels portfolio,
microalgae has the best promise for
[SPEAKER_00]: achieving significant contributions for
transportation fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Utah State University, we began
building a research program that could
[SPEAKER_00]: address algal biofuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on how to grow it, how to
extract it, how to process it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ASOT was recently clocked at 73.977
miles per hour, which may not seem like
[SPEAKER_01]: blistering speed, but it beat the existing
land speed record for its one liter small
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel engine class, which is an engine
size comparable to that of a riding lawn
[SPEAKER_01]: mower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't about the speed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The real story here is the fuel,
the science behind it, the research that
[SPEAKER_06]: goes into it, and the fact that we have a
real replacement for fossil fuels possibly
[SPEAKER_06]: in our hands right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here at Utah State, we take an A to Z
approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we work with the College of
Agriculture, who are plant scientists,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they understand how do we grow these
microalgae to accumulate the high levels
[SPEAKER_04]: of these biofuel precursor compounds
called lipids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we're biochemists, we focus on how
do we take those cells and how we process
[SPEAKER_04]: them and refine them to get the fuel
itself and then that can be used to do
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel test engine tests and also to be
used in the Aggie ASOL diesel streamliner.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the screaming success of the ASOL
dragster, they've proven the concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: The algae-based fuel works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the next big hurdle for the team is
bringing down the cost of production.
[SPEAKER_07]: Algae don't automatically produce the oil
needed to make biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stress is needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are working on getting the stress right
to increase oil productivity and bring the
[SPEAKER_07]: cost down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, algal biodiesel is about $15
per gallon.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think we can bring that cost down
significantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're really excited about the enormous
potential microalgae has to be a player in
[SPEAKER_05]: the biofuels area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming from Colorado State to join the
team here in the Mackanklin Aerospace
[SPEAKER_05]: Department, I take data from plates like
these and open raceway ponds and other
[SPEAKER_05]: processing technologies to inform
systems-level analysis, enable us to
[SPEAKER_05]: really focus our efforts in research and
development to drive the cost down,
[SPEAKER_05]: looking towards commercialization in the
future.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are currently studying algal production
in both high-input bioreactors and
[SPEAKER_06]: low-input open raceways.
[SPEAKER_06]: These laboratory-scale raceways are
powered by state-of-the-art LEDs,
[SPEAKER_06]: which allow us to provide the equivalent
of summer sunlight 365 days a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Growing algae in a greenhouse under
electric light will never be
[SPEAKER_06]: cost-effective, but it greatly accelerates
our research progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If their past success is any indication of
the future, we could all be driving
[SPEAKER_01]: algae-fueled cars very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
