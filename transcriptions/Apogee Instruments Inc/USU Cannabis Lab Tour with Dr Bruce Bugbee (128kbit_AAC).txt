[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, Professor of Crop
Physiology here at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this short video, we're going to give
you an overview of the medical hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: research we're doing in the Crop
Physiology Laboratory here at Utah State
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had numerous questions from many
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of research do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do the research?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you finding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I just want to show you some of
the techniques that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd like to start with this plaque
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were told when we started that the
university had a huge research program in
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to the university library in
Special Collections, and here's a picture
[SPEAKER_00]: of people from 1931.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing the hemp in the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, they were growing it for rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fibers and the work was grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Navy needs the rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have synthetic fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value for rope is much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still grow it for textiles,
and we still grow it for seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: for eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our research here is focused on
botanical medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And medical hemp allows us to study
botanical medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about it, we have a lot of
people with many problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription drugs, opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanical medicines are far safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to understand how their use
is in pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had conversations with the medical
school at the University of Utah to study
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmacological uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're doing here is optimizing
yield and quality of the flower buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are then extracted for CBD oil,
primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our work is low THC lines of
cannabis, but it's still cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many people in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's eight or ten growers that have
licenses to grow high THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working with them to optimize
their work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to say our license here is just
to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after doing many studies, we know that
we can extrapolate most things from hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: to marijuana because it's the same genus
and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from a lecture from yesterday
in crop physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the laboratory the teaching
laboratory where we work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to start here and then walk
around the greenhouse and the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers to give you a sense of how we do
this work, the types of studies that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: at a world class laboratory for controlled
environment research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been funded in this laboratory for
almost 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: By NASA and all of the work for NASA has
been to grow plants in closed environments
[SPEAKER_00]: for feeding people in space, whether it's
a colony on the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our current project is a colony on Mars
feeding people on the space station.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked with NASA to fly plants in
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bred a unique line of wheat called
Apogee wheat for use in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a long close partnership with
NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: About four years ago, a consortium of
large greenhouse growers in North America
[SPEAKER_00]: came to me in the lab and said,
could we fund you to study hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a complex crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, we had to tell them,
no, you cannot fund us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not legal federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 15% months ago, it became legal
federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we immediately got the green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got licenses from the state of Utah to
study hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we switched part of our research
capability from studying food crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environments for NASA to
studying the quality of medical hemp for
[SPEAKER_00]: use in pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want to give you a sense of
how we do the research and where we
[SPEAKER_00]: publish the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the greenhouse and take a
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll walk out from the growth chamber to
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently got funded by NASA to make an
improved system to grow plants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: space station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the press release from NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of the system we're
proposing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty high tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is not easy to water plants in
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to overwater them because the
water doesn't drain out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had flooded plants in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had drought stress plants in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our new system is loaded with sensors to
keep the light exactly right, keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen in the root zone exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're excited to be working with NASA
to make a high tech system for the space
[SPEAKER_00]: station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the graduate room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Graduate students have offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some of our recent
publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pictures of people that work
in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a cosmonaut on the International
Space Station holding the wheat that we
[SPEAKER_00]: developed for space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become real psychologically attached
to the wheat, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to keep looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our work on medical and industrial
hemp right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of our recent publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one on far-red photons and their
photosynthetic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precision water stress, plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of work on hydroponics in this
lab and a lot of work on photobiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's walk and talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep coming with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going out in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple research scientists in
here that do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all different sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one where we're studying types of
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we use sawdust in media to reduce
cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: This section is for our student organic
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting ready for spring scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the section that I want to show you is
this one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this is a secure section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our certificate to study medical
hemp, medical and industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we keep our genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all mother plants that are
under long days with high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: light to keep them vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take cuttings from these and
propagate them over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working right now with about 12
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers around the nation send us
their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hear, test my new line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're continuously getting new lines of
cannabis in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should specifically say medical hemp to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why some of these are taller and
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We enrich out here with high pressure
sodium lights to keep them vigorously
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting about 600 micromoles of
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an averaging bar for the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This keeps the plants growing vigorously
all throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we monitor the light in here carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: This section is CO2 enriched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an aspirated shield in which we
carefully measure temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a CO2 sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's connected over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the fans just came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our system for monitoring CO2 in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another thing we monitor and
control for optimal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow cannabis without CO2,
but it grows better with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here we're studying oxygen
nanobubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a special system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens to be made by the Molier
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts microscopic bubbles of oxygen in
the water to improve air aeration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with them to optimize
aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also working with them for plants on
the space station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of our mother plant
greenhouses where it starts, where we take
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings and grow uniform plants that we
move into the growth chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's move into the growth chamber
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take a look at what we're doing in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our growth chamber room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get my prox card out lock out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 40 growth chambers in this
lab for testing various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are big, some are little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're remodeling all the time to keep
them updated for the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our work is basically hydroponics
because we make concentrated nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions and inject them into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what comes out, the plants are getting
watered with nutrient solution every time
[SPEAKER_00]: they're watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all on drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at one of the
chambers right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at the plants through the
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this video, we're going to open
the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a closer look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are, I'd have to look at the
door, but they're about 21 days after what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call the inductive photo period,
short days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of a temperature study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to optimize the temperature for
these, but temperature interacts with
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're forever in here measuring the
light to make sure the light's exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same in all the chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chamber comes with a light sensor in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular chamber, I have to look,
this is at 29 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of our warmer treatments,
but the plants are growing real well in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we do is by Julian date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starts with day one, goes to day 365 to
keep track of all the studies starting and
[SPEAKER_00]: stopping, at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's walk and look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second chamber, this one's 26 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26 Celsius is 79 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is intermediate, the plants still
look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we, all of these are continuously
monitored for temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: light by a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: A simple scientific data logger hooked up
to computer screens so we can make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the controls are working all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chamber's at 23 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is it's a little on
the cool side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not doing as well as those chambers
at warmer temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be okay, but 23 is a little on the
cool side for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, it's still got a ways to go to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one other study I'd like to show
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These four chambers are four different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're studying in here is the effect
of light pollution on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it needs to be dark at night,
but exactly how dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: We coined the term reagent grade darkness
to mean really dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the full moon bright enough to trigger
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that is no, but how much
light can they take?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: All four of these are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are LEDs, and it's going to be real
hard to see, but right up in here is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny red LED that gives them a tiny
bit of red light at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some of the plants are
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on how bright the lights are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these chambers look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have different amounts of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to zero in on how much
light the plants can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these studies, Apogee has developed a
special sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the nanomole sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It detects trace amounts of light,
so we can extrapolate the results from
[SPEAKER_00]: here to all growers' operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is one of the most sensitive
plants to light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, our data indicate it's about the
same as poinsettias, and they're quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the data is not all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do studies, we create different
treatments, we do more studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants get drip irrigation with
the nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this, it's a pretty big container
to make sure they're not at all stressed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our special media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a peat vermiculite media that we make
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get optimal plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good place to stop for
this growth chamber room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at one other room
where we're doing studies on light
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the laboratory right outside my
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are award plaques from previous
students over the years that when they've
[SPEAKER_00]: graduated, we give them an honorary degree
and something unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for coming up on 40
years, so we get a lot of students over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are small chambers that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size and shape of the chamber on the
space station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in between studies right now
here, but here's where we create our own
[SPEAKER_00]: light and precisely study qualities on
young plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really want to take a look at is
this chamber right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this one's pretty heavily
instrumented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this chamber, we're studying light
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see right from here,
we've got three types of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are about two and a half weeks from
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're high pressure sodium lights,
LEDs, different ratios of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do five treatments at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take our Apogee spectroradiometer and
characterize the ratios of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium, which makes the
plants look orange or gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then LEDs in this one, which has a
much better color rendering index.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the things we're finding is
we can diagnose plants much better under
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs because the colors are more true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell subtle nutritional
effects under high pressure sodium light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're in the hallway to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thrilled that we finally have
funding to do some serious science on
[SPEAKER_00]: medical hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The universities of the world really have
had limited ability to study this until
[SPEAKER_00]: the last year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our case, we were able to
transition part of our work with NASA to
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately get a jumpstart on the studies
with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we'll do is just walk down
the hallway here, but we have years and
[SPEAKER_00]: years of students that have done studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can show you a few posters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Curtis Adams, who is now an
assistant professor at Texas A&M.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studied polymer coated slow release
fertilizers, Polyon, Nutricot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Osmocot for his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutricot's the most expensive,
but it was the highest quality that we
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this work, which was funded by
NASA, NASA switched from Osmocot to
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutricot for studies in the space station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we walk down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This poster is turning yellow because it's
so old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of our early work with
nutrient management in closed hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of our wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have written several papers on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of these posters turns into
referee journal articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's high pressure sodium technology
advances with double ended lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Jake Nilsen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is now a PhD student at the Max Planck
Institute in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a terrific student, highly
recruited by them, did some nice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lysimeters weighing plants to
precisely measure transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Van Ersel is now an assistant
professor at the University of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Julie Chard was our research associate
that did all this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can track transpiration and stomatal
conductance over time on these
[SPEAKER_00]: computerized lysimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of work on chlorophyll,
and it's led to some commercial meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Perry is now a research scientist
for Pioneer Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was his work on measuring chlorophyll
in leaves using optical meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led to the Apogee chlorophyll
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take one more minute to show you a few
more posters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Kusuma is a current PhD student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this poster showed our interest in
light quality and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, we coined this term the
Farpar index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is is a ratio of far red
light to traditionally photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a number from zero to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work showed that our old approach
of measuring phytochrome photo equilibria
[SPEAKER_00]: was not as good at predicting stem
elongation as this new Farpar index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're here, this is phytochrome
photo equilibria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, depending on the
background of light, these lights aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is red, far red ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lines still aren't together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Farpar index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, the lines converge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we've gone to reporting
this in our studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because regardless of background colors of
light, we get consistent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another paper by Jake Nielsen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done dozens of studies of light
quality in this lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This went all the way back to fluorescent
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was some of the early days of LEDs,
characterizing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's vegetative propagation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we were working out procedures to
get it to root quality, quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that work was done here and presented
at national conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cannabis in the field is grown from
seed, but the absolute highest quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: grown from rooted cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to be able to get 100%
rooting from those cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my colleague, Larry Rupp,
who has since retired, and Sabrina Sage,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is a outstanding undergraduate student
that did this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little bit of the work that we've
done for NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food production on Mars, ultraviolet and
far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ultraviolet's here, the far red's
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them affect plant growth,
so we manipulate them in different ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, we just got a paper accepted for
publication in the journal Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticulture Research on this topic right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Current and Potential Efficacy
of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it peers into the future and analyzes
how good can LEDs get within the next five
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another poster in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's been up here a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of breeding of super
dwarf plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely short because they work very
well for NASA and the space station
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out they work well for lots of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the world doing research in
controlled environments because they're so
[SPEAKER_00]: compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these we developed, some of them
we got from breeders in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're so short that they are not
commercially available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we maintain the seed stocks here and
for research scientists in other places
[SPEAKER_00]: provide seed for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're back in the classroom to
conclude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make the point that we don't
just study hemp in this lab, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: we did look at hemp plants just now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the NASA funding, none of that is for
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is for food crops,
leafy greens to provide fresh vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: for astronauts, tomatoes, all kinds of
fresh crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years we've studied a lot of
agronomic crops too, particularly wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing multiple things and it
really is because of sustained funding for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to attract some of the
best talent from around the nation in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of graduate students because they're
the lifeblood of this whole operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work that they are doing is just
terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something like eight of my former
students are now assistant professors at
[SPEAKER_00]: other universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a great thing because after
they graduate and leave we continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to you again in a future video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
