[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments and this is a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: seminars on principles of environmental
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what number we're on but
today we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetically active radiation and to
me every single component to this is
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to understanding plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that I've been particularly
involved with for a long time in my career
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to give credit to Mark
Blonquist who is the chief scientist at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I have worked on this together for
more than 10 years refining this
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement and understanding its effects
on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we want to look at is what
I consider to be the eight cardinal
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are these eight parameters?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a plant and we always want
to show the anatomically correct roots of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well let's take the below ground
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all we have nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, we have water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, we have oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three parameters below ground that are
critical to excellent plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the ones above ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we have temperature and I'm going to
abbreviate that temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, two, three, four, five,
not necessarily in order of importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide, critical parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're missing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The elephant in the room is radiation and
I'll put that in a giant box up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure all of these parameters
better than the plants can sense them but
[SPEAKER_00]: in the case of radiation the plant is so
exquisitely sensitive to that that our
[SPEAKER_00]: best sensors are only equal to what the
plant sees so I should put some arrows
[SPEAKER_00]: here for radiation coming in and
specifically today we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about photosynthetic radiation,
a subset of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I put this slide in here to really
emphasize how critical it is to do
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these sensors we can tell
temperature by what's cold, it's warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can feel the soil through water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell if it's high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we can tell temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell radiation but our eyes are a
terrible light meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our irises contract when we go out in
bright sunlight and we don't realize how
[SPEAKER_00]: bright it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back inside, they expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very poor ability to tell the
amount of light and the result of that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to draw another little figure
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our plant outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get that same plant and it looks
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, oh your plant must be low on
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is low on white and anytime you have
indoor plants you really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't emphasize more the importance
of really understanding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple sources of lights to measure
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Sun here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different types of electric
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: High-pressure sodium, ceramic,
metal, heavy metal, heavy metal,
[SPEAKER_00]: compact, fluorescent, all with different
colors of light and there's a whole body
[SPEAKER_00]: of studies about what's the right color of
light for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into that but our
research says there's not as much
[SPEAKER_00]: difference as you might think among colors
of light but we're missing one key color
[SPEAKER_00]: on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light emitting diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of some plant growth
chambers with different colors of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tremendous amount of research
going on with colors of LEDs and people
[SPEAKER_00]: are using them for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now look at a sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to integrate all these different
types of light and accurately predict
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the focus of this seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the options for doing that and
making accurate measurements of this so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can predict the rate of plant growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so a couple of definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, and these are confusing to a lot of
people, PAR is photosynthetically active
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation and that just means the
radiation that drives photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV light, that's radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants filter that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't result in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near-infrared light doesn't have high
enough energy for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the radiation for photosynthesis
and we'll come back to this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is close to the visible range as
well, what our eyes see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the radiation that drives
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, second definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic photon flux or
photosynthetic photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these two things refer to the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next slide I'll explain the use of
these two terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the whole amount of radiation,
again between 4 and 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really all of these terms refer to the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all this radiation that drives
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terms here are technically a little
more exact and PPF and PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get then to what's a quantum and
this gets back to Einstein and quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quantum is a mole of photons and this
mole is Avogadro's number of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's these particles coming in and we
know from the stark Einstein law that one
[SPEAKER_00]: photon excites one electron and that's the
first step in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really interested in measuring
with these moles of photons and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what the sensors measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in the next slide
but quantum sensor then is a sensor to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we say quantum sensor,
we could say a PAR sensor, we could say a
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF sensor, PPFD, they're all the same
thing but that's where this word comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quantum sensor or if the sensor is
connected to a meter then it's a quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: meter and I'll show you some examples of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact let me show you an example right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a quantum meter sensor plus the
meter and reads out all by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy just the sensor and hook it up
to a data logger and then it's a quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it means between the two of
those definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to talk about this issue of
flux and I've given myself a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteboard to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we talk to our physicist colleagues,
flux has two definitions and you would
[SPEAKER_00]: think by this time in evolution of science
we'd have this term all worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One definition is per time and in the case
of photosynthesis this would be moles per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one definition of flux,
moles of photons per second but equally
[SPEAKER_00]: valid is per area and time together and
this means moles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in physics these are two things are
used interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use this definition per time we
would have PPF and then where's the area
[SPEAKER_00]: in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh we better add D for density to this
definition to make sure we've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use this definition and we said PPF
D, well wait a minute we've got per area
[SPEAKER_00]: and per area again so this D could be
redundant and we wouldn't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look through the literature on
this, half of the people say PPF and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other half say PPF D.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terms are used interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mean the exact same thing but it's
been confusing to people just as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing to physicists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a flux only per unit time or does it
mean per unit area and time?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the purposes of this we don't need to
worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF and PPF D are equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright now let's go to what we're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's photosynthetic reactive,
photosynthetic photon flux, photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means radiation between 400 and 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp cutoffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember that Stark-Einstein law that
you're remembering for the test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Equal weighting of all photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One photon excites one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every photon coming in up here gets equal
weighting on this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are blue down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is green in the middle and then red
and then right after 700 it's infrared IR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermal radiation doesn't cause
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this here with equal weighting
of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sensor that can get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp cutoffs on the end so we can predict
photosynthesis and plant growth by
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's take a look at how we do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is our quantum sensor that we just
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: One detector right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One filter and one output if we ran it
over here to a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quantum sensor but this has to
be designed with filter to get all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these colors exactly right and that's a
tricky business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we make the jump to light speed now we
have a spectroradiometer and a prism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks up the light and we have lots of
arrays down here and this goes off to a
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also more than 10 times the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: How accurate are these compared to a
spectroradiometer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare them back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two options to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantum sensor, spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are quantum sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One from Lycor, one from Apogee and the
Apogee spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bigger, a lot more stuff going on
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we did x-ray vision we'd have a prism
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks the light up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into multiple detectors down here and
these have a single filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the most widely sold in North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lycor and Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lycor came out with a new sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a better head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sheds water better now than this one
which tended to trap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a nicer cable like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about the new sensor and the old
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both equally accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how it sheds water and how
rugged it is for outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 times the cost for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need very accurate measurements
this is the instrument of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how close we can get with
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our box again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equal weighting of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kipp and Zonen is widely sold in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Lycor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how closely they match this curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp cutoffs because there's multiple
colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real important to have a sharp cutoff
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are their two model numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new Lycor looks a lot like the old
Lycor and it's equally accurate to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at the original Apogee
sensor that Apogee has sold for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes up a little slow in the blue and
look how it cuts off here at about 660.
[SPEAKER_00]: It misses this radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not serious because it's calibrated
to light sources unless you get a light
[SPEAKER_00]: source with a lot of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at an example of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come into the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a red LED and it's called deep red
because it's very close to this cutoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put deep red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is common in some LEDs and of course
this is a blue LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cuts off before it can capture that
deep red LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an excellent sensor for all types
of light sources except when there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: deep red LED in the light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the original Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blue line that we just looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee developed a full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this gold line right here that cuts
off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the gold, the green,
and the blue lines are all very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes up better here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to measure red LEDs or LED
spectra, this is better than the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference in cost for the full
spectrum is about two times as expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are quite a bit more
expensive than this, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring LEDs, you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the original black sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slightly taller, slightly bigger
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a higher end sensor,
it's a gold color instead of a black
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the two sensors look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Original and full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go back to that graph and here's
the difference again right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a close look at the
accuracy of all of these sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that, we need to use this fancy
integrated method originally developed in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1966 where it takes all the colors of
light and it multiplies this by the
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy of the spectral accuracy of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that Mark Monquist has
done in great detail for all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the equation to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into that now except
let's look at the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: How close do we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kippenzonen, Lycor, and this is also the
190R.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very close to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the original ORIG, Apogee,
and the new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put new right here, Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight and cloudy, these are all tiny
errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't need the full spectrum to
be accurate if you're just doing sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any errors less than certainly 1% are very
tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even 2% errors are fairly small for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take cool white fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these errors, less than 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all calibrated to be 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small errors, small errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at the original Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's LEDs, red and blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember it didn't capture that red peak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using it under there,
it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you need these, you need full
spectrum and we jump to full spectrum and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halide a little better, high
pressure sodium better, but these errors
[SPEAKER_00]: here in particular are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a close look at this and pause
this video and study it, you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the errors between Kippenzonen and Lycor
and the full spectrum Apogee are all
[SPEAKER_00]: really small under all of these different
types of light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is an asterisk because it has
separate calibrations for sun and electric
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's explained on the Apogee website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's take a look at the next
slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go back one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectroradiometer, remember the 10 times
big more expensive?
[SPEAKER_00]: It nails every single source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero errors because it's measuring every
color individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really need excellent accuracy,
you need a spectroradiometer to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people, if they have two or three
percent accuracy, that's good enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: their applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to conclude on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee also makes a line quantum sensor
and it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we want to measure radiation
underneath the canopy, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's bright light and shadows,
so this sensor averages the light over the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole length of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start to cover some of these,
it gives you a proportionately reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that is helpful for
people for transmitted light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I have examples here hooked up
to meters of the old, and I guess I should
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in the same order as this,
but the old and the new sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the new one is full spectrum and
more accurate under all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope this overview of some
terminology and some differences among
[SPEAKER_00]: meters is helpful to understand and make
more accurate measurements of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to another session on other
topics in environmental biophysics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
