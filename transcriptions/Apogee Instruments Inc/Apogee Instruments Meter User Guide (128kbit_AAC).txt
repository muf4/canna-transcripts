[SPEAKER_00]: This is the user guide for the Apogee
Instruments M-Series meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a meter with a part number
that starts in MQ, MU, MP, or MI,
[SPEAKER_00]: then this is the user guide for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, let's do a quick overview of
the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: First you have the meter, power button,
sample button, or what I like to think of
[SPEAKER_00]: as a back button, a mode button,
kind of an enter button as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: an up and down, a USB port, the battery
cover on the back, as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter-twenty thread mount, the sensor
cap,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sensor itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, there are two
things to note.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the meter is not waterproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a little bit of water on it,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll wipe off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sensor head is waterproof and
submergeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing to keep in mind is that
when you press the button, there need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be firm, intentional pushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you push it too light or too fast,
it won't register.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show you now how to insert
or change the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, flip the unit over, remove the
screw.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the screw removed, take the cover,
pull the cover up slightly, and then push
[SPEAKER_00]: to the right, and then lift up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: To remove the battery, I like to use the
screwdriver that I just removed the screw
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press down slightly and pull to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have the battery out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that when you insert the battery
or you change the battery, you use the
[SPEAKER_00]: CR2320 size, and make sure that when you
put the battery back in, it's oriented
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive side should be facing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take the leading edge of the
cover and put it right on the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: battery holder, and then push down and to
the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you can put the screw back
on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, for chance, you have a low battery
indicator that doesn't go away when you
[SPEAKER_00]: replace the battery, you need to do a
master reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this, leave the unit powered on,
and then remove the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should make that low battery
indicator go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go into how to use the meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, make sure you remove the cap
from the sensor itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: To turn the unit on, press the power
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: To turn the unit off, push the power
button again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that this unit does have an
auto power off function, and will
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically turn off after a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the home screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, you can see how many data sets
you have saved, your current data
[SPEAKER_00]: readings, and what mode you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this screen, we can see we're in
sample mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The M-Series meters have two modes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first mode is the sample mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mode where you can go around
collecting data and saving data by
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing the sample button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the count goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number is now saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That data is saved up to 99 data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware that saved data doesn't come with
a location or a timestamp, so make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you write down and document your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: To review the data points, press the up
and down arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go back, after viewing the different
data sets, press the sample button to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're back in sampling mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: To change modes, press the mode button.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blinking mode tells you which mode
you've selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently we're in sample mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you press the down button, it'll change
to log mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press the mode button or enter button.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think mode and enter are the
same button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, it'll ask you whether you want to
run that mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whether you want to reset the data in
that mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, if you want to run,
just push the mode button or the enter
[SPEAKER_00]: button.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to clear the data that you
have saved, press the mode button,
[SPEAKER_00]: select sample, and then you have to hold
down the down button and then push the
[SPEAKER_00]: mode button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will clear your data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that because it'll zero out
the data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other mode that the M-Series meters
have is the log mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the log mode, the meter itself will
take a reading every 30 seconds and then
[SPEAKER_00]: average that over the course of 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 30 minutes will be saved into the
data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meter will also save 48 of those as a
daily total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those daily totals are only accessible by
a desktop PC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll show you how to do that in just
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to the log mode, press the mode
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press down and log should begin to blink.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's blinking, press the mode or
enter button and then press the enter
[SPEAKER_00]: button to run the log mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Log mode will automatically begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meter will eventually automatically
turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meter will automatically turn on every
30 seconds and collect data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That data is averaged into a 30 minute
average which is then recorded in a data
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those data points are reviewable by using
the up and down button.
[SPEAKER_00]: To return back to the log mode,
press the sample button.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both sample and log mode, the maximum
number of data points it can save is 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go more than 99, it will erase the
oldest data set first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the data sets are available from the
M-Series meter on the desktop application.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to access the data from the
M-Series meter, you need to use the AC100
[SPEAKER_00]: USB adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might look like a regular USB adapter,
but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regular USB cable will not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you now how to access that
information with a PC computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the AC100.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will convert a UART protocol to a USB
protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with the AC100 cable, there's a
flash drive that comes with it that has
[SPEAKER_00]: the software on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If for some reason you lose the flash
drive or you want more up-to-date
[SPEAKER_00]: software, you can go to the Apigee
Instruments website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First go to the Apigee Instruments
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the support column, you'll see
software downloads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll down until you see handheld meter
data collection software, or it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Apigee AMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll install it for PC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through and install that software.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the software has been installed,
it should look something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need to connect the meter to the
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the meter plugged in, you need to
select the communication port.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over in this box in the lower right
corner, you'll see a drop-down tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This automatically pops up as COM3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that and click open port.
[SPEAKER_00]: If for some reason you can't find a port
available, you need to type it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that, go to your search bar and
search device manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, look at this list and find
ports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the ports.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will show you which port is
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is COM3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that COM3 and type in COM3,
and then click open port.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can see that we're connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here we can view the sample data,
the 30-minute averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it might take a few seconds to
load all the data, so be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as the daily totals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This data is in CSV format, or comma
separated value.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a spreadsheet program like
Excel or Sheets to convert this into cell
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using your cursor, select the data that
you'd like to copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit control C to copy that data,
and then open your spreadsheet of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be using Microsoft Excel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's open, select the cell and paste
that data into that cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be one long string of values.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to convert that into cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So select that cell you pasted the data
into, then go to data and click on text to
[SPEAKER_00]: columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's open, choose the delimited
option and hit next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you separate by commas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hit next, and then you can hit
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll turn that data into cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select those cells, go to insert,
click on charts, and then I just chose a
[SPEAKER_00]: line chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it gives you the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a quick data analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information, please see the user
manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is available at the Apogee
Instruments website on the product page,
[SPEAKER_00]: or available on the link below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any other questions,
leave a comment below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
