[SPEAKER_01]: Summarize this, and I remember to get my
space blanket out of my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can all understand how I can
get nice and warm in here with this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should carry one of these for
emergencies, like in their back pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might become more important than your
cell phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mostly you can buy these at
camping stores, because that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: people end up using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these are so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Car manufacturers should all be required
to have a little pocket in the door,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of these comes with the car in the
pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever get stranded in a cold place,
then you can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended the last lecture talking about
radiation frost, so I'm going to give some
[SPEAKER_01]: examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a picture of a radiation frost
detector, just a flat black disc.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how nicely that radiates to
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work at all in the day,
because it heats way up above air
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, but it's designed to only do
at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an example graph of what this looks
like at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air temperature, bud, and leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, bud temperature is a single little
sensor about the size of a fruit bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: and here's a classic example of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's above zero Celsius,
so we're all happy, but right here the air
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is plus three, and the wind
died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I go back?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to get back to that page.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were close to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to start around the way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wind dies, and the temperatures
separate, and we have the beginning of a
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf starting to freeze, because it's
below air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the wind picks up, and not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still calm wind, and then the wind
dies here, and these separate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now clearly this leaf has been below
freezing for several hours, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: finally the little tiny bud even goes
below freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue line, or at least the red line,
is what a grower ought to be after,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just the black line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically, they've used the black line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can go back to our camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do growers do to protect against
frost?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge industry, and it's common
to have problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why fruit orchards are located on
the tops of valleys and on the edges,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the cold air drains to the middle,
and they're somewhat protected by
[SPEAKER_01]: elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have fruit orchards in the middle
of the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're up along the benches for that
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many years ago, and I remember this as a
kid growing up in Minnesota, reading about
[SPEAKER_01]: the Florida fruit growers, oranges in
Florida, and they would get these frosts,
[SPEAKER_01]: late spring frosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tender buds are out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is a picture of some fruit trees
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't have to be in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most common way to protect your fruit
trees was to light this thing called a
[SPEAKER_01]: smudge pot, and it was designed to burn
really inefficiently and make a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of black smoke, and they never got
all that hot, but this black smoke would
[SPEAKER_01]: go up like this, and guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just blocked the cold night sky,
and this was effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was effective for protecting trees
against this radiation frost, because that
[SPEAKER_01]: emissivity was blocked, and these were
used for decades by fruit growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'd have them all over their
orchards, and they'd go out and light the
[SPEAKER_01]: smudge pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they really make bad air pollution,
so they were banned, and now what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers going to do to keep their fruit
crops alive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they could increase the wind,
that would help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a picture here,
but they're not hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smudge pots go away, and there are
pictures on the internet of huge towers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like reverse electric wind
generators blowing wind over their crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: all through the orchard to mix the air,
and these are cooling by radiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're warming them back up by wind,
so they both prevent inversions because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the wind, but they also mix the air so
that the airflow over the leaves warms
[SPEAKER_01]: them up, and they don't have a radiation
frost, they just have leaves similar
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature to the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wind is a solution, but these wind
generators, and I've talked to some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit growers in Utah, they tell me they
cost $10,000 per hour to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are big wind generators,
and if they're super expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course I'm going, geez,
you know, wouldn't you like to just put a
[SPEAKER_01]: few thousand into a lot of really careful
monitoring, because if you could just not
[SPEAKER_01]: run this for an hour, you paid for your
whole weather station.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting there, but better
monitoring so they can pinpoint when they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to turn these on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they pay for themselves the value of
the fruit so much, but now there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: third technique that's getting more and
more popular, and you're going to love
[SPEAKER_01]: this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the cover of the American Society
for Horticultural Science a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is a fruit tree crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this was in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dwarf fruit trees are in pots,
and it's the first thing in the morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you would go, oh what a bummer,
you know, his crop is ruined.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this grower is so happy, and you see
that sprinkler right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is using latent heat of condensation
to keep his trees warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go below freezing, he turns on the
sprinkler, and this is cold water,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when that water freezes, it releases
heat, and it warms the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only once you start this, you have to keep
going all night long because it can't
[SPEAKER_01]: stop, but he keeps running the sprinklers,
the water keeps freezing, doesn't pollute
[SPEAKER_01]: the air, doesn't cost $10,000 an hour,
he's just running his sprinklers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's using physical principles to
prevent frost in his crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is now the most widely used
method of frost protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a mess, there's mud everywhere,
and yeah, it uses water, but it uses water
[SPEAKER_01]: in the early spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's usually more water, and it's way,
way cheaper than running these fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on the orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is harder to do, of course,
if the trees are big, but it's a great
[SPEAKER_01]: principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I saw this and started thinking
about this, I think I have a data logger
[SPEAKER_01]: in my house, and I run a wire out in my
yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the thermocouple and put it next to my
garden, and I didn't want to automate this
[SPEAKER_01]: because why miss all the fun?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to turn on a radio when the
temperature got below freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get up and put on my slippers and go
turn on my irrigation controller,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is a picture of my garden in 82
Crockett Avenue on one morning after a
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little glary, but this looks like
those orchards all covered with ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing froze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had tomatoes that made it through the
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great achievement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I'm monitoring how the
temperature went with thermocouples out in
[SPEAKER_01]: my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't just a theoretical thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this in your yard to keep your
tomatoes going longer in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you have to do is pay for the
water bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it just sits there and freezes and
protects them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could, I suppose, but if it got a heavy
and a branch broke off, it could damage
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't happen all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just little tiny freezing,
and it gradually builds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: What time of year was this?
[SPEAKER_00]: When's typically the last time you can
expect this from happening in Cache Valley
[SPEAKER_00]: based on your experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: So our frosts, it depends exactly where
you live when the frosts are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're later on campus than they are in
the middle of the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the middle of the valley,
sometime in September and into early
[SPEAKER_01]: October.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is you get one frost,
and then you might get what you call that
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian summer, two or three weeks of nice
weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take advantage of that if your
plants didn't freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was probably September?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, late September.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the idea that the ice just melts off
during the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is what happens in the
day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now the sun comes up, and the
radiation's more favorable, and the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: shines on it, and it melts the ice,
and they're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you could probably keep irrigating
and melt it off or something, but the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: melts it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually kind of important that
it doesn't thaw up immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's typically a cold, clear night is
followed by a sunny day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clear at night, it's clear the next
morning, so it warms up and you can melt
[SPEAKER_01]: all the ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the temperature swings are big,
and it just barely went below freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next day, it pretty easily melts
all the ice the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ought to try this at home,
because it works, and you just need a
[SPEAKER_01]: little controller to tell when to turn the
sprinklers on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know when to turn them on,
because you make it worse if you turn them
[SPEAKER_01]: on too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's wet, and now it makes them
colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only makes them warmer when they really
are below freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to get the timing just right
and calculate the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're freezing, then you start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then plants can take minus one below
freezing, but they can't take minus two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this keeps them right close to
freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple other follow-up things on
conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an article from a few years ago,
a newspaper article, nice concise summary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But many people know, everybody knows
about windchill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you grow up in a really cold place,
and it's windy in the winter, the
[SPEAKER_01]: windchill is way colder than the air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was a kid growing up,
they closed schools, because the windchill
[SPEAKER_01]: got so cold that they just closed the
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out the windchill factor
was initially a really crude factor by a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy in Antarctica putting a can of water
out and then looking at wind and how long
[SPEAKER_01]: it took the water to freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made this crude index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much later, people came along with
biophysical principles of heat transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: and made a new windchill factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they found was this guy
overestimated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really not as cold as it
seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the corrected index.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were slow to use the new one,
because everyone likes to brag about how
[SPEAKER_01]: cold it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really not as bad as it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a short summary of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And calculating the windchill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that, by the way, on campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a line for windchill in the
winter, how cold it gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now this is widely used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now people, when they do the
school closings, they don't use the
[SPEAKER_01]: embellished windchill factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use the real one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice summary of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had these beads up here for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see those, Chris, in this thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot to show these to you the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It occurred to me to make this a couple
years ago when I was asked to do a TED
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk on water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to find ways to emphasize
what's in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went to Al Sporting Goods and
bought a bunch of these little white
[SPEAKER_01]: pellets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had to paint them colors to
get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this big jar represents the nitrogen
in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20.95%.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the oxygen in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is the carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 10,000 of these BBs to every four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the point is, wow, the plants have to
find those four molecules for
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what we get to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 20.95% for our breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at what's in the air and nobody
ever mentions water because water is so
[SPEAKER_01]: variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: These other ones are very constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we add water to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you counted these, I made this
example 3% water, which is a typical day
[SPEAKER_01]: in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this was air in the winter,
and if this is a real thing, I could take
[SPEAKER_01]: this and I would just pour a bunch of
these out so there's just a few left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter air hardly has any water in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so cold the water can't hold
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this jar would just have a few water
molecules in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we made hot, humid air, this could
double.
[SPEAKER_01]: This amount of water vapor in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've always liked this because it's a
nice concise visual demonstration of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor,
and CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the other stuff, like there's a
little argon and the other stuff we can
[SPEAKER_01]: ignore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we certainly can't ignore these four
CO2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, there would have been
three in this jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you know how old I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old enough to remember when there were
three in this jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we got this up to four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working another 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might get it up to five in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 400 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four in that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a great visual demonstration of
what's in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose I could do this with some leaf
and have these inside the leaf and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could even have them kind of
falling out of the leaf to show
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably a lot you could do with
BBs from El's Trophy or El's Sporting
[SPEAKER_01]: Goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we want to switch a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let me, another miscellaneous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple other miscellaneous things that are
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This came up the other day a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comfort box on a psychometric table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll look this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the same psychometric chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for the space station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity and temperature interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they say we try to get in this box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it varies a little bit with humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do building control,
you try to arrange your humidity and
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature to be in the comfort box for
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also came up the effective pressure on
this psychometric chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought of a way to show this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a psychometric chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sea level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably can zoom in just slightly on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks exactly like the ones we
handed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this has other factors in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has enthalpy and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the chart for sea level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I made a transparency of the exact
same chart for our elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked it up and printed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to lay this on top of this
and trying to line up the zeros.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they look pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not exact, but they're pretty
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at these,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shift is like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go to high elevation, this
saturation curve shifts up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's 1,500 meters and here's sea
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at the numbers for 28C and
the absolute humidity for 100% at 28C.
[SPEAKER_01]: At sea level is 24.6 and in Logan it's 29.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after you divide for air pressure,
this number is 86% of that number and our
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure is 86% of sea level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when this chart is per kilogram,
it's a different chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this chart is saturation vapor pressure
and you divide by pressure, then it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: same chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need charts for elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only differ when you have amount of
water per weight of air, not per volume of
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see when the pressures less that
the air dilutes and it's the same amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we simplify that whole chart
to just do that saturation vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to talk about, in closing,
implementation of all of these principles
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been talking about in what's called
the Penman-Monteith equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use this, two guys, Penman and
Monteith, we use this equation all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to calculate evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to show you the equation and
say, how do these principles go into this
[SPEAKER_01]: equation to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps the best book for this is this
book called Food and Agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: Organization, FAO 56, Crop
Evapotranspiration Guidelines for
[SPEAKER_01]: Computing Crop Water Requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is full of step-by-step
implementation of these principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can probably put this right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it occurs to me that with this thing I
could just open the pages and show the
[SPEAKER_01]: pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead I made some, I copied some of the
key graphs out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is there's a website for this
and you can get the whole book on the web.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the book, the paper copy,
costs quite a bit, but the website's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump right here to the
Penman-Monteith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to fold this to make it fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to zoom in just a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we can, I could probably zoom in
even more, get this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the Penman-Monteith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this varies, the coefficients vary
depending on the units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a rough sense, if we took all these
energy balance principles and rearrange
[SPEAKER_01]: the equation, they would have a lot of
coefficients like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, this is with the units in
here, reference evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what this means is the maximum you
could get for the conditions in
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeters a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could do that with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then look at the next components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Net radiation minus soil heat flux.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we didn't put soil heat flux in here,
but it wouldn't be hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could just say some's disappearing in
the ground and some's coming back out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's net radiation right front and
center in this equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we go air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump to E saturation minus E air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's our leaf to air difference in
this equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of these coefficients,
without going into this in detail,
[SPEAKER_01]: are units conversion to get this to net
radiation and resistance to water flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another key thing that people don't
think about in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: U is wind speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a universal symbol for wind speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the numerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the numerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: As these get bigger, transpiration gets
bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at wind speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in both the numerator and the
denominator of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now wind speed is just up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's wind speed in the numerator and
denominator?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask the question, does wind
increase transpiration, true or false?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be no change too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tricky question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it turns out, I've heard this was
part of a law case once with somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: suing somebody else over water rights and
the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the leaf is already well watered and
it's close to air temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if it's especially below air
temperature, the wind will definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: increase transpiration by a lot because
it's warm and the wind warms the leaf up
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's below air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time when we use this,
it's for well watered crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then wind does increase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now imagine a cactus or some plant that's
water stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are 10 degrees C above air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transpiration is minimal, but the wind
starts to blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves cool off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a case where the wind could
decrease transpiration if the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: water is stressed and the wind helps cool
the leaves down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an exception, but it could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In intermediate cases, you can kind of see
that from here with the numerator and
[SPEAKER_01]: denominator, wind doesn't have as big of
an effect on transpiration as most people
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cools our skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're benefiting from both of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're out and we're hot and the wind
breeze blows, we cool off, but in the case
[SPEAKER_01]: of water, we're only worried about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This book, FAO 56, includes this nice
graph here, figure 10, effective wind
[SPEAKER_01]: speed on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's increasing wind speeds,
hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helping, but as it gets more humid,
here's an example of no effect of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even this effect is not all that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a real steep line.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because wind affects, it can cool
off the leaves significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another useful figure from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is an example of these components
through the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just talk about, calculate examples
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: At noon, but here's our
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: They show lambda for that symbol.
[SPEAKER_01]: H is conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_01]: H is a common symbol for that,
and G is storage in the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's the total and its partition
roughly equal into the two parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this particular example, ET was more
than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the mornings, when it's cool,
ET can equal net radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then finally, transpiration can't keep up
and then the leaves start to warm up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine scenarios like this where
the partitioning of these changes all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the place depending on water of the
plants, but it's a nice diagram of how
[SPEAKER_01]: that changes through the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another important aspect of this that is
often overlooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: This calculates ET, but now we have a
coefficient with this, and as we've run
[SPEAKER_01]: these equations, it's ET0, or ET0,
and you can think about it as optimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the maximum that could run,
and everybody runs this equation and they
[SPEAKER_01]: calculate the maximum and they think
that's what they got to irrigate with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the maximum, not the typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all those components that we just
showed in this big honking equation
[SPEAKER_01]: measured with great precision with all of
our instruments to get the inputs just
[SPEAKER_01]: right in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then to estimate actual, we multiply this
by K, and a lot of times it's shown as Kc.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a crop coefficient, and it changes
with the amount of ground cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the plants are little, there's not
much evapotranspiration they fill in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This number varies from zero, and I've
seen it as high as 1.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually can go above one, which says
something about whether this is really the
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal because the crop coefficient is
even higher than the optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very coarse estimate of the
water, so even if we get this to three
[SPEAKER_01]: significant digits with the most precise
instruments ever, we got to multiply it by
[SPEAKER_01]: this, which at best is plus or minus 10%,
maybe 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this equals ET of the crop,
of the actual crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not many people think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take a number that we're trying to get
super precise, and we multiply it by
[SPEAKER_01]: really kind of a ballpark estimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That leads to a lot of people really over
irrigating in the implementation of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a diagram of that in this book of
the reference crop ET0, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: multiply by this factor to get ET of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, because plants aren't always well
watered, even with all of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is still for well watered,
then we try, I might show this down here,
[SPEAKER_01]: back out just a bit, then we try to put an
adjustment factor in here for how water
[SPEAKER_01]: stressed they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two fudge factors on this
precisely measured ET.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crop coefficient, and then this is
really a water stress coefficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we get the crop coefficient adjusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time we get to this one,
where it's kind of like spray and pray,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're hoping you got it in the ballpark
for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, we're running out of water,
so there's a lot of potential to calculate
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about another technique of
calculating this.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, there are at least 20
equations in the literature for
[SPEAKER_01]: calculating evapotranspiration from
weather variables all over the place,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're discussed in this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blaney Criddle, I've forgotten all the
names, but many, many people have worked
[SPEAKER_01]: on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is becoming the standard because our
weather stations are getting better,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have instruments to measure all the
parameters to do this, and it is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: biophysical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on physical principles,
so we've come to trust this, but lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't have all the instruments to
measure the inputs to this, so what are
[SPEAKER_01]: they going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they do before the
Penman-Monteith was usable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a one-page handout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep two pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote this for some of the introduction
to this Utah climate book about ways to do
[SPEAKER_01]: ET, and it's hopefully easy to read,
but it shows more than 20 equations have
[SPEAKER_01]: been developed to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It summarizes all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get to this, the Hargraves
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: George Hargraves was on the faculty here
at Utah State University, and of the 20
[SPEAKER_01]: equations, I would say next to the
Penman-Monteith, his is one of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works the best, and it is way simpler
than the Penman-Monteith to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the equation, and I've been told
this story by Rick Allen, who was on the
[SPEAKER_01]: faculty, who has written much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has an award-winning paper called The
Penman for All Seasons, and it's about the
[SPEAKER_01]: use of the Penman-Monteith equation in all
conditions all around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Rick tells me he and Hargraves died
about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lived here in Logan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said Hargraves would come in his
office, and the models didn't match the
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements, and he'd say, yeah,
and the two models wouldn't agree,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hargraves and the Penman-Monteith,
and he'd say, yeah, well, that's because
[SPEAKER_01]: your model is too complicated,
and you're going to get bad data in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you just use my model, it's simple
and it works, and it does work for a wide
[SPEAKER_01]: range of conditions, and look at the
inputs to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Min and max temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, this was from the days when there
were no data loggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had min-max thermometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we had to go on, and his
brilliance in developing this was to
[SPEAKER_01]: empirically correlate min and max
temperature with pan evaporation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's got mean right here, but the mean
was in between min and max, so he still
[SPEAKER_01]: had min and max.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 0.05.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the square root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ra.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say, oh, we had to do net radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calculated it based on radiation above
the Earth's atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was completely a model based on
latitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have to measure net radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calculated it from the time of year and
the sun above the atmosphere, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: here's a coefficient, and this equation
for ETO works remarkably well,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's way simpler, but we don't use it
much anymore because we've got lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: instruments, and we can use the far more
complex Penman-Monteith.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get into the literature on this,
and you turn the page, this is with my
[SPEAKER_01]: colleague Larry Hips talking about this,
this Hargraves tends to under predict
[SPEAKER_01]: under high wind conditions and over
predict in high relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's not perfect, and then when it gets
to minus 17 .8 C, it goes nuts because
[SPEAKER_01]: values go negative, but you're not too
worried about that because those are super
[SPEAKER_01]: cold days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made for the summer, but I show this
just because it's a brilliant empirical
[SPEAKER_01]: equation that does a pretty good job
matching the evapotranspiration data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to close with this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we work and work and work to model this
and calculate it, we keep going back to
[SPEAKER_01]: lysimeters, a big container that we can
weigh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can accurately measure transpiration
used by weight, but you have to contain
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants in something you can weigh,
and all of a sudden you're into ten,
[SPEAKER_01]: twenty thousand dollars per container in
the field to set up a system to weigh the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a system in the research
greenhouses that my students and I built,
[SPEAKER_01]: and each one of these has a load cell
underneath it, and here's some corn plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get evaporation low, we covered them
with tin foil, but we can do various
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of water stress in here using
lysimeters and look at these principles
[SPEAKER_01]: and see how well they apply to different
kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do precision water stress with this
because we can bring them down to a low
[SPEAKER_01]: weight and keep them there, just water
enough to keep them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell how well water stress they
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can determine, obviously, hourly
transpiration rates with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all hooked up to multiplexers and
Campbell scientific data loggers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we watch them transpire on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a really useful technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it constrains the roots,
so there's our big interacting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would they do in the field if they
had more roots?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get bigger lysimeters, we can get
bigger load cells, but they don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: precision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can't have as many replicates if
you have big load cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on in the class, we had indicated
that we have a photosynthesis term in the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy balance, but because photosynthesis
is small and a lot of our other
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements come from equations that are
approximations, we tend to assume
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis is negligible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this application, however, you have
high precision instruments to very
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately weigh the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly what water loss is,
but there's going to be a mass gain
[SPEAKER_00]: because of carbon, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you worry about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're into the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, the weight of this will
change because the plants are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger, and not just the dry weight,
but the fresh weight of the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do worry about that, and in some cases
we calculate it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases we calculate it out,
but this brings up a really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to make a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would think, wow, aren't you using
this to measure the size of the plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: not know the amount of water in the soil,
because the weight of the water down here
[SPEAKER_01]: is several orders of magnitude greater
than the fresh weight of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water use efficiency of these plants
might be one gram of dry weight per
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand grams of water, transpired,
so that says something about, and it might
[SPEAKER_01]: be 10 grams of fresh weight per thousand
grams of water, but the water
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration and the water flux through
this is at least a hundred times bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: than the fresh weight gain, and we back
calculate the fresh weight gain by the
[SPEAKER_01]: water lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we've transpired a hundred grams of
water, then 0.3 grams of fresh weight is
[SPEAKER_01]: added to the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does matter, but it's small because
of the poor water use efficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if water is fluxing through those
and the fresh weight gain is tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were calculating photosynthesis
earlier, we were saying it was maybe 2% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the radiation and now we're at 1% of the
water, so very similar scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: One to a hundred might be fresh weight,
but photosynthesis makes dry weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's more like one to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand grams of water lost and one
gram of dry weight showing up,
[SPEAKER_01]: which kind of, it's small, and depending
on the
[SPEAKER_01]: model, photosynthesis can be 5%,
and so now if we're really tweaking this
[SPEAKER_01]: model, we can start to put coefficients in
for this, but this leads to a larger issue
[SPEAKER_01]: with models.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least in my experience, we start
putting more coefficients into this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and we forget about the importance of the
two big things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love simple models.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the relationships right in your
head and start to think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we start to add more
coefficients, and the tendency is to think
[SPEAKER_01]: we've made a better model because we have
14 coefficients instead of two,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it gets in the way of people's
thinking to have extra coefficients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases, they don't fundamentally
add to the precision of the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously a big discussion among
lots of people is how many coefficients to
[SPEAKER_01]: put and how many are useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's analogous to how many
significant digits you show in a
[SPEAKER_01]: spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, we can calculate a spreadsheet and
Excel puts six or eight significant digits
[SPEAKER_01]: on every number, and now you're scanning
that spreadsheet looking for patterns in
[SPEAKER_01]: the data, and all those extra digits are
just noise, and they block our ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the big picture patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all sidebars related to your
question, but
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis is in some of the models,
and for sure when you apply this to soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you'd have storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't talk about storage at all,
but the book goes into storage quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, and that's a whole other subject for
getting that storage component right,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why we have heat flux sensors in
the soil to try and measure that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's hard to measure, so we'd model
back and forth, measure and model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope we got that part of it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll end there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been a great audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming to these lectures,
and hopefully you find places to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
