[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Mark van Iersel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my daytime job, I am a professor in the
Department of Horticulture at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Georgia, where I do a lot of
research on lighting and controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of that research is funded by the
USDA through a project that is called
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits,
in short, LAMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to my job at the University of
Georgia, I also have a company that
[SPEAKER_00]: focuses on making lighting control systems
for controlled environment agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, both greenhouses and vertical
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That company is called Candidus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I try to keep my academic and
company presentations separate from each
[SPEAKER_00]: other, but hopefully, as we go through
this presentation, you will see why,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, it is relevant to actually
combine the two into one presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to talk about today is how we
can optimize lighting in controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that that is important is
because in controlled environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, and again, this refers to
plant factories or vertical farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as greenhouses, lighting is
necessary, but it also tends to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, lighting typically is the
second most expensive thing in these
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities after lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that expense, good control over
how you provide that lighting can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make the difference between being
profitable versus losing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going to provide a whole lot of
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to jump right into what we have
been doing from a research perspective and
[SPEAKER_00]: how we then try to apply that in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about optimizing
supplemental lighting, the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think about as a plant physiologist
is studying how plants actually use light
[SPEAKER_00]: and capture that energy to drive the
growth of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will indulge me, I will have just a
few slides on some very basic plant
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we will actually move into
more applied things and ultimately bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of how we can actually help the
industry save electricity costs through
[SPEAKER_00]: better lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a diagram of a membrane that
we see here going along this slide that is
[SPEAKER_00]: present inside of the chloroplasts,
inside the cells of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic mechanism that I am going to
show you here basically occurs for all
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where ultimately light energy is
captured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to get converted into chemical
energy, which then can be used to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars and plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole process starts with a photon,
which in this example is going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That photon is captured and the energy
from that photon is used to drive the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of an electron through that
membrane with the help of a second photon
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This electron ultimately moves through a
compound called NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an energy rich molecule that
subsequently can be used in the Kelvin
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle where it is used to convert CO2 into
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, as this electron moves,
it also provides energy to create ATP,
[SPEAKER_00]: another energy rich compound that is used
to make sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, and a bit of a side note,
this photon is also used to split oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: from a water molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the oxygen that we breathe
ultimately comes from this reaction right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These light reactions of photosynthesis
that we see here are very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only for plant growth, but also for us
being able to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the very basic process that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that the rate-limiting step
of the light reactions happens right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where photosystem 2 donates an electron to
what is called the plastocenone pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can understand the efficiency of
this process, then we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the whole rate at which these
light reactions occur in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that this is actually
surprisingly easy to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we measure fluorescence that is given
off by chlorophyll right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can very easily calculate the fraction
of absorbed photons that are actually used
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive this electron transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called the quantum yield of
photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: A former graduate student in my lab,
Jeff Weaver, collected data on lattice
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout an entire growing cycle in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this graph right here, he plotted the
photosynthetic photon flux density on the
[SPEAKER_00]: x-axis against the quantum yield of
photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see, and this is true for all
species, not just lattice, is that as the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photon flux increases,
the quantum yield of photosystem 2
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the more light we provide
to a plant, the less efficiently the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can use that light to actually
drive plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we know the efficiency with which
plants are using the light that they get,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we know the amount of light that they
receive, we can calculate another really
[SPEAKER_00]: important parameter, the rate of electron
transport through the light reactions of
photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is shown right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have the photosynthetic photon
flux density on the x-axis, the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport rate on the y-axis, and we see
that electron transport increases
[SPEAKER_00]: asymptotically with increasing light
levels, and it reaches a maximum here at
[SPEAKER_00]: some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the basic plant physiology
that I want to talk about, but the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: that we study this very intensely in my
lab is because when we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of how these basic processes
in plants work, we can actually start to
[SPEAKER_00]: make predictions about how to best manage
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: From these curves, we actually were able
to come up with a few hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you should get the best
light use efficiency for plants if on a
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter term, you maintain the light level
as stable as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will result in more electron
transport than fluctuating light levels
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the same average PPFD as a
stable light level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, short term, we want to have a constant
PPFD throughout the entire day as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, and more longer term,
we want to have the same amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching the plants from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the total amount of light that reaches
plants within one day, we call the daily
[SPEAKER_00]: light integral, and so theoretically at
least, having the same daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral from day to day, we predicted,
would result in better plant growth than
[SPEAKER_00]: having fluctuating DLI levels that average
out to the same value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, as I emphasize right
here, this is theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theories are great for science,
but they need to be validated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we actually then followed this
work up with studies where we tested both
[SPEAKER_00]: of these hypotheses to see how important
actually is it in practice to have stable
[SPEAKER_00]: short and long term light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first study that I quickly want to
talk about is a study that was done by a
[SPEAKER_00]: former master student in my lab,
Rukaiya Boyan, and she did a study in a
[SPEAKER_00]: walk-in group in the growth chamber,
basically a small vertical farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: where she looked at short term
fluctuations in the photosynthetic photon
[SPEAKER_00]: flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every 15 minutes, the light level would go
up or down, and in all treatments,
[SPEAKER_00]: those light levels would actually average
to a PPFD of 200 micromoles per square
[SPEAKER_00]: meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here you can see a picture of a
small part of the setup that she had,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this red circle, you can actually
see plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were exposed to really wide
fluctuations in PPFD, so right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are in the dark, but 15
minutes later, these plants would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been getting a photosynthetic photon flux
density of 400 micromoles per square meter
[SPEAKER_00]: per second, so that it averages out to
200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these other plants were getting
different kinds of light fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rukaiya collected lots of data,
but right here, I just want to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and growth, and let me go back real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to first explain the setup of
this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the bottom x-axis right here,
we have the PPFD during the 15 minute
[SPEAKER_00]: period that these plants were exposed to
low light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes from zero to 200 micromoles,
and at the top, we have an other x-axis
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows the photosynthetic photon flux
density during the other 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that goes from 400 to 200
micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, it all averages out to 200
micromoles per square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rukaiya worked with two different lettuce
cultivars, as you can see right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: little gem and green salad bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she measured both the dry weight of
these plants as well as the leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at the data,
what we see is that as we go from left to
[SPEAKER_00]: right, and the fluctuations in light level
become smaller and smaller, it turns out
[SPEAKER_00]: with very large fluctuations in light
level, the plants grew very poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in many of the treatments,
so when we look at light levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: low light levels of 80 to 200 micromoles,
or high light levels of 320 to 200,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants grew the same and that was true
for the dry mass of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also was true for the leaf area of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this study told us is actually
that we don't have to maintain that stable
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD for these plants to grow well and use
light efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are actually perfectly
capable of tolerating pretty wide
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most extreme treatment in which the
plants do well was the treatment in which
[SPEAKER_00]: the PPFD fluctuated from 80 to 320
micromoles throughout the entire growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are pretty big fluctuations,
but the plants were able to adapt to that
[SPEAKER_00]: very effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this basically told us that our
hypothesis that we had that stable PPFD
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are important was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: TC Jayalov, a PhD student in my lab,
said that a follow-up study, where rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than looking at short-term fluctuations in
light levels, we actually changed the PPFD
[SPEAKER_00]: from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of part of the setup
that he used in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you may see right here in each of these
different sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a quantum sensor that is measuring
the amount of light that is reaching the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is connected to a control system that
allows us to very precisely control the
[SPEAKER_00]: light that is provided by these LED bars
that you see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can then program in exactly what
the daily light integral is going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these different sections,
and we can have different lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments in each section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this study, TC worked with green
salad bowl, and his treatment are
[SPEAKER_00]: summarized in this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had one day with high DLI,
which was always followed by a day with
[SPEAKER_00]: low daily light integral, and then again,
we would go back to the high DLI day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was one treatment in which
the plants received a DLI of 15 moles per
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter per day, every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the DLI fluctuation, which is something
that we'll see in subsequent graphs,
[SPEAKER_00]: was zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same DLI integral each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we go down, what we see is
increasing fluctuations in the DLI
[SPEAKER_00]: integral with the most extreme treatment
that we could realize in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: was a high DLI integral of 22 moles per
square meter per day, followed by a day
[SPEAKER_00]: with a DLI integral of 8 moles per square
meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fluctuation then in this case is 14
moles per square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a picture of what
representative plants in these different
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers here in black show the DLI
fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bigger that number, the more the
light change from one day to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can hopefully see here
already is that most of these plants look
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty similar with the exception of this
plant right here that had the most extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations in DLI integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant received 22 moles one day,
8 moles the next day, back to 22,
[SPEAKER_00]: 8, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the whole cropping cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of the other plants look very,
very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TC, of course, quantified these
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, once again, we have a graph that
shows the leaf area on the left and the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry weight of the plants on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the statistics to compare all of
these different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the control treatment with a daily
light fluctuation of zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw was that only the
treatment with a DLI fluctuation of 14
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, and likewise in this graph
right here, those plants actually grew
[SPEAKER_00]: more poorly than plants that had the same
daily light integral each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this told us that lettuce can actually
also tolerate pretty wide fluctuations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the daily light integral from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a limit to how large those
fluctuations can get before you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful reduction in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were very surprised to see that
these plants could actually tolerate
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty substantial fluctuations in the
daily light integral without a meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in the growth of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, the hypothesis that we
started with was actually not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants turn out to be much more
tolerant of fluctuating light levels both
[SPEAKER_00]: short term and long term than we had
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is actually pretty important
because this opens up important
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities related to how we control
light and control the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have this precise control we
don't need to have this precise control
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have the exact same light level
throughout the day or the same light level
[SPEAKER_00]: from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take advantage of the fact that
these plants are able to tolerate changing
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one way that that ability of plants
to tolerate those light levels comes into
[SPEAKER_00]: play is that it allows us to take
advantage of variable electricity prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many commercial facilities don't have a
set electricity price that the price of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity may depend on the overall
demand for electricity at that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an example here of how the
electricity price for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities may change over the course of a
day where perhaps there is a preset
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule as we see here for small and
large commercial customers where during
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the day when there is a lot
of activity the electricity prices may get
[SPEAKER_00]: higher or in some cases the electricity
price can change in real time as is
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated here by this example of this red
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case the price of electricity
is responding continuously to changing
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if lots of people want electricity as
you see right here and right here the
[SPEAKER_00]: price goes up in the hope to reduce
overall electricity use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so utility companies do this variable
pricing to try to smooth out electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: use over the course of a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps them manage the grid if they can
reduce the peak power use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really big deal for utility
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course in controlled environment
agriculture this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we think about variable
electricity prices and the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity to drive lighting obviously we
would preferably provide supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting as much as possible during times
of the day that the cost of electricity is
[SPEAKER_00]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would want to limit the amount of
light that we provide or electricity that
[SPEAKER_00]: we use when that electricity is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a complication with trying
to implement this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States we have about 2,200
large utility companies with another 3,000
[SPEAKER_00]: small utility companies in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each utility company has its own
pricing structure that may be based on
[SPEAKER_00]: real time pricing that may have a preset
schedule and on top of that they typically
[SPEAKER_00]: have a demand chart that is based on the
peak power use of a customer during a 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minute window during a single billing
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only does each utility company have
its own pricing structure what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation of this in lighting control
complicated is the fact that there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform way in which these utility
companies provide information about
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity prices to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have different ways to do so and
that means that you may need to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: separate software for each utility company
to take advantage or to be able to read in
[SPEAKER_00]: real time electricity prices and then take
advantage of that in lighting control
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point I think the biggest
hurdle in implementing this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial setting is the fact that we do
not yet have a uniform way to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: information about electricity prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that will change in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that is of course
important for controlling supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting in greenhouses are the weather
conditions and when I say weather what I
[SPEAKER_00]: really mean is the amount of sunshine that
is going to be available over the next day
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we know in advance how much
sunlight we are going to get we can take
[SPEAKER_00]: that into account as we develop the best
strategy to provide supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the University of Georgia we have
done some work on sunlight forecasting
[SPEAKER_00]: we've tried multiple approaches and they
work really well during most of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: but none of them actually work well before
sunrise and they don't work well before
[SPEAKER_00]: sunrise because we don't have any
real-time information yet about how much
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine is available and so that is
really problematic because many
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses like to start their
supplemental lighting very early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning maybe three or four a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: when the neighbors are asleep and they
don't really care if there is any light
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution and so it makes it difficult to
provide an optimal lighting strategy if we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know how much light we're going to
get over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the practical solution I think from a
commercial perspective is going to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that want to provide strategies
for lighting control simply can purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: solar forecasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So solar forecasts are readily available
and have largely been developed for solar
[SPEAKER_00]: energy generation so that utility
companies can predict how much electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: can be generated through photovoltaic
panels and so this is just an example of
[SPEAKER_00]: solar forecasting actually the first two
and a half days that we see here are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past so we have two and a half days of
real-world measured light levels which are
[SPEAKER_00]: shown in blue here it's called global
horizontal irradiance but it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy term for sunlight and then here we
have a day and a half of forecasted
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight levels and so that information is
going to be really valuable to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: better lighting control algorithms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that purchasing these forecasts I think
is going to be the practical way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the University of Georgia with the
help of the team of a colleague at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University, Javad Muhammad Puavelmi,
we have developed algorithms that can take
[SPEAKER_00]: into account the needs of the plant that
can take advantage of variable electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: prices and in our case we were using
sunlight prediction methods and the goal
[SPEAKER_00]: was to minimize the cost of electricity
the algorithm looks like this right here
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through the math right
here if you're interested in it the
[SPEAKER_00]: citation is right here at the bottom so we
implemented that lighting control
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm from the previous slide in
research greenhouses at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia and this is a picture of part of
the setup that we had so we have an Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum sensor right here that measures
the amount of sunlight that is coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse that quantum sensor is
connected to a Raspberry Pi microcomputer
[SPEAKER_00]: and that Raspberry Pi microcomputer does
the required calculation and then
[SPEAKER_00]: generates a signal through these
electronics right here that is sent to the
[SPEAKER_00]: power supply of the LED fixture so we have
the power supply right here the light
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture right here and lettuce plants
underneath it and so this Raspberry Pi was
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the lighting throughout the
entire production cycle and we had three
[SPEAKER_00]: different lighting scenarios that we
wanted to compare one of them is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call the baseline scenario and that
baseline assumes that we know in advance
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how much sunlight we are going to
have when so that results in the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: solution but because it requires precise
knowledge over how much light we will get
[SPEAKER_00]: when it is impossible to implement so this
was basically a theoretical control for
[SPEAKER_00]: this study and then we had our prediction
based method that takes into account the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop requirements variable electricity
pricing and predicted sunlight levels this
[SPEAKER_00]: was implemented and we compared that to
what we call a heuristic lighting control
[SPEAKER_00]: method where we make sure that we always
have a minimum photosynthetic photon flux
[SPEAKER_00]: density for the crop by dimming the lights
in response to sunlight it's a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: approach very easy to implement but it is
certainly not optimal that said this is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably still better than what is used in
many commercial greenhouses so when we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at how these three different methods
perform in this case during a very
[SPEAKER_00]: overcast day what we see here is the blue
line shows the amount of supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: light that would be theoretically the best
possible strategy in response to changing
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight during the day and the sunlight
right here is shown with the black dashed
[SPEAKER_00]: line the sunlight levels were extremely
low this day so our prediction based
[SPEAKER_00]: method is shown in red and we see that it
follows the blue line or the theoretical
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum pretty nicely with a little bit of
divergence maybe right after sunrise and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of divergence right after
sunset but overall it is very very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: and both of these methods provide a lot of
day a lot of light early in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: because electricity is relatively cheap in
this example and we provide less light
[SPEAKER_00]: late in the day when electricity is more
expensive the heuristic method provides
[SPEAKER_00]: the same amount of light early in the day
as late in the day because it is not
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of taking advantage of changing
electricity prices when we then look at a
[SPEAKER_00]: partly sunny day we have once again here
in black the sunlight levels so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see that it is a much higher than in the
previous example and b it goes up and down
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit during the day but what we see
here let's start with the blue line again
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows a theoretical optimum the
lights should be off during most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day and then a little bit of supplemental
light is provided early in the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: once again late in the day and we see that
our prediction based method does fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: well but it provides a little bit too
little light during the morning hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to make up for that later in the
day the heuristic method provides quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of access light here during the
morning hours and it also provides quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of light during the later part of the
day so based on these data we could
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the electricity use and the cost
of electricity required to grow a crop of
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce in a greenhouse and so this table
summarizes some of that information and so
[SPEAKER_00]: the prices here are expressed in dollars
per hectare if you want to convert that to
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars per acre you simply divide all of
the numbers by 2.5 but so to grow this
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce crop in winter time it costs
$160,000 in electricity and that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best case scenario the baseline to provide
the supplemental light required to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that crop when we compare that to how well
our prediction based method does we see
[SPEAKER_00]: that that increases the cost of providing
that light by $1,700 per hectare that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% increase in the cost of electricity so
we got within 1% of the perfect solution
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would consider that to be really
accurate we were very pleased with that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when we look at the pretty
simplistic heuristic approach for
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lighting we saw that the
heuristic approach increased the cost by
[SPEAKER_00]: $8,800 per hectare or 5.5% and I actually
thought that that was not too bad either
[SPEAKER_00]: that's still pretty accurate but when we
then look at what happens during late
[SPEAKER_00]: spring when there is a lot more sunlight
available we see that precision lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: control A becomes more difficult and B
becomes much more important so when we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the total cost for that lighting
in an ideal scenario that would be $95,000
[SPEAKER_00]: per hectare in spring we have to provide
less supplemental light in spring than in
[SPEAKER_00]: winter which is why the lighting cost is
cut almost in half and then when we look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the prediction based method that we
developed our cost was $7,300 per hectare
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than the perfect scenario so we
have roughly 8% higher electricity cost
[SPEAKER_00]: but comparing that to the heuristic method
it increased the lighting cost by $60,000
[SPEAKER_00]: per hectare compared to the perfect
solution and $52,000 higher than our
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction based method so now we see that
our prediction based method starts to do
[SPEAKER_00]: much much better than the heuristic method
and once again I want to point out the
[SPEAKER_00]: heuristic method isn't all that bad when
compared to standard lighting control
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches that are used in greenhouses so
the bottom line here is that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of potential to reduce electricity
cost by implementing smarter lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: control solutions and so our prediction
based method I thought worked very well if
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get better predictions better
forecast and incorporate those I'm sure we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do better and I want to point out that
we got similar plant growth under our
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction based method as compared to the
heuristic lighting control method but
[SPEAKER_00]: average over winter through late spring
the prediction based method can reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity cost by about 35% so that is
pretty substantial and in principle this
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty easy to implement we need a
Raspberry Pi microcomputer a quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor and some pretty simple electronics
so that we can interface with the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights so we hope to do larger scale
trials this coming winter to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that this still works in commercial
greenhouses where we would have to control
[SPEAKER_00]: much larger areas of lighting and where we
want to go with this in the future and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what something that I'm really
passionate about is make sure that these
[SPEAKER_00]: better lighting control strategies that
we've been working on that they can meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the needs of the controlled environment
agriculture industry and of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: main objective for them is to make sure
that they can produce whatever crop
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing in the most profitable way
possible but we also want to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: account the need of utility companies and
that means shifting as much electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: use as possible from peak hours away to
times of the day that electricity use by
[SPEAKER_00]: society at large is relatively low and
that can reduce peak power use it can help
[SPEAKER_00]: utility companies manage the grid better
and this is an issue that utility
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are very interested in and
ultimately what we also need to do is meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the needs of society controlled
environment agriculture can use a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity generating that electricity
tends to generate greenhouse gases and so
[SPEAKER_00]: what can we do to reduce the amount of
greenhouse gases that are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with providing all of this
lighting and control environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture hopefully we can cut that
significantly but the question is that
[SPEAKER_00]: different stakeholders have different
priorities so the question then and
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes how do we balance these different
priorities and how do we make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody ultimately comes out ahead and
so this is where my company Candidus comes
[SPEAKER_00]: in because as a company we are much better
positioned to drive this innovation and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that it becomes available to the
control environment agriculture industry
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can implement these solutions
that we develop at the university at scale
[SPEAKER_00]: and so what is really exciting to me is
that Candidus is collaborating with the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Resources Conservation Service
through a conservation innovation grant
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are demonstrating the energy
savings potential of advised lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: control systems so to give you a very
quick idea of what we do at Candidus here
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a picture of our lighting control
system so we have a computer here with
[SPEAKER_00]: some additional electronic components that
help us interface with the lighting system
[SPEAKER_00]: we use Apogee quantum sensors to measure
light levels and so this is the hardware
[SPEAKER_00]: but with that hardware of course we need
software which includes a user interface
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is a screenshot of what our users
see and where they can set how the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: should behave so they can set the photo
period right here for ornamental or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growers they can control the
photo period so they can make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they control the flowering of plants
whether they want them to flower or stay
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative they can do that through night
interruption turning lights on for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hours in the middle of the night or
through daylight extension and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: some unique capabilities where we can use
existing dimmable lighting systems to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide this lighting at a relatively low
intensity we also have daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: carryover where we can take advantage of
days that have a high daily light integral
[SPEAKER_00]: one day we take that excess light and then
we can provide a little bit less light the
[SPEAKER_00]: next day this is the user interface where
people see how the lighting system is
[SPEAKER_00]: performing this is real-time data on light
in the greenhouse and the green line shows
[SPEAKER_00]: how the LEDs are responding to that you
can have a summary of the settings at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and this shows how much light the
greenhouse has received and the next step
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we will do with the NRCS is
actually develop guidelines to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: incentive programs or rebate programs for
controlled environment agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: producers to help them implement these
advanced lighting control systems in their
[SPEAKER_00]: own facilities and it's really exciting to
us that there are multiple utility
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that already have started
providing rebates for better lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: control systems for a long time they have
provided rebates for more efficient lights
[SPEAKER_00]: switching from HPFs to LED but what we see
now is that they also start to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: rebates for better control systems and so
ultimately what this should lead to is
[SPEAKER_00]: that controlled environment agriculture
facilities we have a vertical farm right
[SPEAKER_00]: here are fully integrated into the utility
network and serve kind of as a buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can use less electricity when
everybody else needs more and then we use
[SPEAKER_00]: more electricity when everybody else need
less and so with this approach we can
[SPEAKER_00]: manage well we can create a scenario where
everyone benefits and the only reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is possible is that we have an
academic institution funding from the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: and a commercial company that together
once again with the USDA is focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing this at scale in the industry
so to summarize this we want to optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize production and profitability for
the industry help utilities manage their
[SPEAKER_00]: grid and we want to provide benefits to
society by reducing greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions so ultimately there should
result in a win-win-win scenario where
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody comes out ahead and with that I
would like to acknowledge the USDA for
[SPEAKER_00]: funding Project LAMP which does the basic
research to make that happen you you you
