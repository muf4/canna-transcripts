[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments and also professor of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this talk today, I want to talk
about modifications to our fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I especially want to talk about the
two edges of the cutoffs at 400 and at
[SPEAKER_00]: 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this talk is a modified version of an
address I gave two weeks ago at a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environments conference at
Tucson, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big conference and I was asked to
talk about this in an invited talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that talk wasn't recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to record it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love starting this off with the dark
side of the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prism divides up the colors and we
analyze them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have LEDs as a very powerful
tool to study these effects, photobiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did used to use prisms a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really amazing change that tools
we have to study this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, not only are they great
tools for fundamental research,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're great tools for growing crops
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're simultaneously doing work on them
and studying their commercial effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start with this, I want to start
with sunlight and look at the ratios of
[SPEAKER_00]: color in sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make the point that there's
not a lot of photons down around 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cutoff down here is less critical
than the cutoff at 700 because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of photons at 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a classic curve of sunlight
worldwide close to solar noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this changes just subtly with time of
year and time of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes a little, but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this, 3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me turn on my pen here and we can
highlight some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only 3% of the photons right in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunlight, because of atmospheric
filtering, drops a lot right at 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we change the definition down
here, in sunlight, this is a small effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still want to look at this because
it's important for LEDs as well as studies
[SPEAKER_00]: in sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at over here, 18%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cutoff makes a big difference for our
measurements of photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this for LEDs,
which is why we're so keenly interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all we ever did was measure
photosynthesis in sunlight, we wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: so concerned about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at our collection of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was this beautiful slide showing the
peak wavelengths, the classic things that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not efficient green, they're in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very efficient violet LEDs
right near the cutoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very efficient far-red LED and
they are being used in light fixtures to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to know if these photons
are also photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because these are being used,
we want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph was made by Paul Kusuma,
who got his PhD with me in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year he graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now at Wageningen University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a long, long relationship
with Wageningen, sharing talent back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've worked closely with Leo
Marcellus there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do now is, oh,
first, let me emphasize two papers that
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Kusuma wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not on the cutoffs, but they're
on LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to get state-of-the-art
where LEDs are now and where they can go,
[SPEAKER_00]: search for Kusuma and Bugbee, and you'll
see our referee journal articles come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's called From Physics to Fixtures
to Food, Current and Potential Efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they going to go in the next
five or 10 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Photon Efficacy in Horticulture
is a real detailed analysis of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at what we know
about, first, the short wavelengths here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the part we're going to zoom in
now on the next graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got 250 to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our classic blue LED that's
very widely used.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very efficient LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used as the base phosphor for white
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have a series of LEDs right
close to 400 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's real critical to know how
efficient these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being used in fixtures because
they can have significant morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on plants, triggering secondary
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do these photons cause photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at this, I want to go back and
look at the historical studies on quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield from photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a paper I published five
years ago, 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a book chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the very famous McCree curve
that more than hundreds, thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: people cite this paper from 1971.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wasn't the first to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A scientist named Hoover did it in 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the technology he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 90 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this, they got similar curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not identical, but similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a Japanese scientist,
Inada, repeated this in 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first glance, these are similar,
but look at the area right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: McCree shows a big taper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoover shows a sharp cutoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inada shows a relatively sharp cutoff,
right down here in the UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask why do we cite McCree's paper
so much when there's other literature on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is because his paper is exceptionally
well written, and it's a series of two
[SPEAKER_00]: papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very comprehensive papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great example to graduate students
to read how clear his writing is in these
[SPEAKER_00]: papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Keith McCree.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a young scientist, I had the
opportunity to spend time with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to Utah State University to give
us a seminar, and he spent an afternoon in
[SPEAKER_00]: my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great thing to know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He died in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at his studies right
here on UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blow this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What McCree found was there was a large
species variability in response to these
[SPEAKER_00]: UV photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studied 21 species, and I've taken from
his data the one that was the most
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive to UV and the species that was
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out radishes were the most
responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunflower was the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if all crops were like radish,
you bet we would move the goalposts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would count these photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're all like sunflower,
you can start to argue we should move it
[SPEAKER_00]: the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But crops vary a lot in how fast this
drops off in the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sunflowers and radishes are not big
crops in controlled environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but lettuce and cucumbers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's lettuce and cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both drop quite fast right here,
right close to 400 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is McCree's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, he had to use prisms and filters to
get this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the equipment he had, now fast
forward 50 years to where we are today
[SPEAKER_00]: with state-of-the-art LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set out in my laboratory to see if
we could reproduce these curves using
[SPEAKER_00]: those violet LEDs that I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: State-of-the-art gas exchange equipment,
state-of-the-art LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this was done by Shuyang Zhen,
who is a very talented young scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got her PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a postdoc with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now an assistant professor at Texas
A&M University.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are her data in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that radish from McCree's data
was one of the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radish is one of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that sunflower was one of the
worst?
[SPEAKER_00]: We repeated McCree's data using 50 years
better technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cucumber was in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato was up there with radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just quite remarkable that we were
able to repeat his data.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about lettuce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: These curves, they go down to maybe 70% at
380 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marshall is a purple lettuce with a lot of
anthocyanin, and that does not use UV
[SPEAKER_00]: photons well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those anthocyanins are pigments that block
the UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the species variability is just
blocking of the UV in the cuticle,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is for protective reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The take-home message from this is these
curves drop off fast, and we don't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to change the definition of
photosynthetic radiation from 400
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers from what we have today,
unless you're doing work with some species
[SPEAKER_00]: that can use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, you ought to buy a
spectroradiometer so you can precisely
[SPEAKER_00]: count these photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move to the other end of the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this is such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been repeated now by scores of
other scientists in laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that far-red lettuce makes the
lettuce leaf expansion take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of lettuce without
far-red and 10% far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of literature on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not controversial to say that far-red
triggers a shade avoidance response and
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the plants get bigger because they
think they're in shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we've known for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is all of this dramatic improvement
caused by photon capture and leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: expansion, or is some of it caused by
direct effects on photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That finding is profound because,
remember, we've said since McCree 400 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 is our range, but now do these far-red
photons contribute to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an extraordinary claim to say that
we should change our fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for this extraordinary claim,
we require extraordinary proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring in Carl Sagan, who in the series
of Cosmas said extraordinary claims
[SPEAKER_00]: require extraordinary proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm now going to show you is the
extraordinary proof that far-red photons
[SPEAKER_00]: cause photosynthesis in the next few
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this we start with papers of Xu
Yangzhen, who was a young PhD student with
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Van Ersel, who is a distinguished
professor at the University of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years ago Mark Van Ersel was a
postdoc with me, and then of course
[SPEAKER_00]: recently Xu Yangzhen was a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark got his bachelor's degree at
Wageningen University and had
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities in the United States and
came across the ocean here, although he
[SPEAKER_00]: maintains his ties with Wageningen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xu Yangzhen and Mark first published a
paper in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all very reputable, high impact
factor, reputable journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Journal of Plant Physiology, and I'm not
going to go into all the details,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they studied the light reactions of
photosynthesis in this paper and showed
[SPEAKER_00]: that the far-red photons clearly improved
the light reactions of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second paper, a year later,
Physiologica Plantarum, they used laser
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs at specific wavelengths to show that
the photons at least up to 730 nanometers
[SPEAKER_00]: were improving the light reactions of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after this work in Mark's lab,
I recruited Xu Yangzhen to come work with
[SPEAKER_00]: me because we have a canopy gas exchange
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very sophisticated system,
but it measures photosynthesis of whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant communities continuously over the
whole life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 10 chambers, here's a few shown
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this canopy gas exchange system and
precise measurements of canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, we published a paper in
Plant Cell and Environment, another
[SPEAKER_00]: high-impact journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far-red photons have equivalent efficiency
to shorter wavelength photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: implications for redefining PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now two years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept going because we were interested
in the long-term effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was short-term effects with and
without far-red on canopy photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a study with long-term effects
through the whole life cycle and again
[SPEAKER_00]: showed these far-red photons had
equivalent efficiency to the shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelength photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Frontiers in Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four significant journal articles
now from two different laboratories
[SPEAKER_00]: showing the value of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this work, most colleagues have
now switched to including photons up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 750 nanometers as photosynthetic when
they're doing studies in controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just stop with our papers
because two other research groups that
[SPEAKER_00]: study this have now reported on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zhao et al., 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tereshima is a well-known scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant & Cell Physiology, a well-known
journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are supporting papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the technical studies on this are
providing that extraordinary proof that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to change our understanding of
far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make a claim like this, it's not
adequate to just say you have empirical
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that this occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a mechanism coupled with the
empirical evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I say, our understanding of how the
world works requires a coupling of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements and models and data and
theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the theory that supports that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the theory, maybe 400 years ago,
we said the moon is made of green cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that must have been because of
reflected light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a common myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people said, you're nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no mechanism behind
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think of all the observations we have
without mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That usually means the observations have
something wrong about them or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: incomplete.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of far-red photons,
I go to my favorite twin towers diagram of
[SPEAKER_00]: how the light reactions of photosynthesis
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know from the Stark-Einstein law,
our buddy with the wild hair, one photon
[SPEAKER_00]: excites one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we count photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A photon comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits the light reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: It excites an electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That electron cascades down in energy and
it makes ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another photon comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: Another electron goes up and this makes
NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is split here in the photosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a really good example of the
energy state of photons exciting electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy over here can be excited with
far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known that for 50 years and that is
called the Emerson enhancement effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That these photons can excite electrons in
photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you don't have any far-red
photons, these two photosystems that run
[SPEAKER_00]: in a closely synchronized process can get
out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the theory that underlies this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many ways to show this but I like
this twin towers diagram which I got out
[SPEAKER_00]: of a photochemistry book to show where the
photons come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the full sunlight spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we have only shown this under
electric lights where we add far-red and
[SPEAKER_00]: we take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's compelling evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it works under electric lights,
it should also work under sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect should also be present under
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now in the final series of studies and
this is with Shuyang Zhen and Mark Van
[SPEAKER_00]: Ersel and myself, we undertook to make
these measurements in sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's 18% photons out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're looking for is an 18%
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this, we filtered the light,
bought special filters that cut this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's our filter, far-red filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very nice filter, cuts this off
cleanly at 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: These photons are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This filter also cut out the UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember we hypothesized that UV is
not going to have a big effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we added measurements with the third
filter that only filtered UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is blocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let this through.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we put the UV filter on leaves and
when I say we, that means Shuyang did the
[SPEAKER_00]: work making the measurements in the
trenches, less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these photons, as predicted,
blocking them had a very small effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason we say 400 cut
off at the bottom is a good cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see no reason to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened up here with the far-red
filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pnet decreased 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember there's 18% photons up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of issues up here
with how high was the light, what was
[SPEAKER_00]: saturating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number doesn't precisely match this,
but that's a big decrease in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not caused by this,
you got to hypothesize something else does
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it wasn't temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured a number of things with this
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This data shows that far-red photons are
important in some light as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: electric lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's look at one other case for
plant ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understory crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start measuring global
photosynthesis, what happens to these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants down here that get filtered light?
[SPEAKER_00]: The far-red light is transmitted to these
plants and if we make a spectral curve of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this is filtered, this is
transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suddenly for these understory crops in
here, wow, more than half of their photons
[SPEAKER_00]: are far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has huge implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we only going to count these photons
in here green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to count all of those
photons?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made measurements of understory
crops filtered by leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applying that filter we block this,
let the green come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: P net decreased 40 to 60 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge effect and it further
emphasizes the value of far-red photons in
[SPEAKER_00]: global climate change research,
our global climate change models.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big finding and throughout all
of this work to collect these data we knew
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a big finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we published this in a very high-impact
journal called New Phytologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has an impact factor above 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reserved for groundbreaking research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the date, July 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a recent publication,
Photosynthesis in Sun and Shade,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Surprising Importance of Far-Red
Photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I refer you to this paper for the
details of how we did the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of excellent reviews from
some prestigious photobiologists in this
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were very appreciative of our
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the collective body of evidence
indicates that we need to be counting
[SPEAKER_00]: photons from 700 to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this look like now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the McCree curve, the classic
McCree curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again we don't see evidence to move
the goalpost here, but up on this end,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember McCree did not do synergistic
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one wavelength at a time and had
he done synergistic wavelengths,
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red and shorter wavelengths together,
the evidence is that he would have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are synergistic with this and so now
the new definition adds this out here to
[SPEAKER_00]: the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the old metric there's 750,
the old metric was called PAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: the new metric we've been calling EPAR for
extended PAR and we're recommending people
[SPEAKER_00]: report both of these in their studies,
but they focus on EPAR as the
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentally best metric and multiple
other laboratories are doing exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're setting, they're counting these
photons as photosynthetic in their
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a number of implications and I
want to review those now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the move from PAR to EPAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, efficiency of fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to count these photons in LED
fixtures and all the evidence is we should
[SPEAKER_00]: be counting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: ASABE does standards for this and so far
their old standard is 400 to 700
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers, but they're meeting again to
revise this and people on this committee
[SPEAKER_00]: have told us we need to change the
standard in light of all the evidence we
[SPEAKER_00]: now have for EPAR as an improved metric
over PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one big implication of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second one is the design light consortium
rates lamps and they're becoming a go-to
[SPEAKER_00]: standard for efficacy of LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do not count far-red photons they
penalize the lighting manufacturers that
[SPEAKER_00]: add far-red to their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking at making this change
too and they probably will have two
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics, PAR and EPAR, to help people
select the best lighting fixtures and then
[SPEAKER_00]: finally in portable photosynthesis
systems, which we use a lot to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, they use LEDs to light the
leaves but historically they've not had
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red LEDs in the heads of these
portable photosynthesis systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means they get artifacts and they
underestimate true photosynthesis under
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight and it also inhibits further
studies on this because the LEDs don't
[SPEAKER_00]: include far-red but there's one exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: PP Systems has now come out with a new gas
exchange it's called the Cirrus 4 and that
[SPEAKER_00]: one has far-red LEDs in the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's continuing evidence that the
world's changing to a new definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people use a LICOR portable
photosynthesis system and we're told that
[SPEAKER_00]: LICOR is looking to add the far-red LEDs
in the head of their meter as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the end of the story but we need
to help you make these measurements and to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that we need a new suite of sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Apogee instruments came out with first
of all they come out with an EPAR sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me draw here's the sensor silver
looks like this let me draw this on the
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is we count the photons equally
here's 400 700 PAR just like the slide
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor goes to 750 and it's called
EPAR Extended Photosynthetic Active
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In sunlight this adds about 18% to the
total photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under electric lights it may only add
three or four percent unless you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red LEDs and now that under electric
lights it can add 18% as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this effect and because we have
the traditional PAR and the new EPAR
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee also made this sensor it's a black
sensor this is hooked up to a micro cache
[SPEAKER_00]: data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor is called the PAR-FAR sensor
creative names for sensors and it has two
[SPEAKER_00]: detectors in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives a reading for PAR and it gives
a second reading for just this radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: right here and then of course you can add
them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you three numbers this reading
that reading and the sum of both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit more money because it
has two detectors but allows users to
[SPEAKER_00]: separately measure both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally lots of people want
integrated meters for daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a relatively new meter that just
it has a microprocessor inside and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives instantaneous EPAR and it also
integrates the total of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stores it in memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get daily light integral for the
past hundred days with this sensor which
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in both of the old PAR version and
the new EPAR version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course all of these sensors can be
hooked up to data acquisition systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be hooked up to meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of people in greenhouses that have
mixes of supplemental light and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't include this we're going to
underestimate the photosynthetic radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do we feel like there is solid
empirical and theoretical evidence to
[SPEAKER_00]: change to EPAR but we've also provided the
same sensors to facilitate making that
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll catch you again in the next video.
