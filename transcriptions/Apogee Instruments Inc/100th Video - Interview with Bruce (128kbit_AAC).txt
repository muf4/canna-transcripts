[SPEAKER_00]: We have a special guest to celebrate our
100th episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Bruce with us here today in the
studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ben, for setting this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thrilled to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce, some of your videos have done very,
very well and received a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the video with the most views is
the Canvas Light Myths and Facts video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has, as of this morning, just under 3
million views.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about 50,000 views away from
reaching 3 million views.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever think you'd have a video with
3 million views, Bruce?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, of course not.
[SPEAKER_01]: When things happen in the world,
I guess we could say this went viral,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's little tiny things that just
answer a lot of questions for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this field, of course, they're besieged
by advertisements from lighting companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our magic spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: In science, we don't have a lot of things
we call magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science and magic really are counterpoints
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the principles, but it's not like
buy this light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the guiding principles to figure
out what kind of lighting you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you figure it out from the
principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me lots of strange things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that you should always plant at
the full moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't tell them that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them, well, we don't have any data
to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and we get sometimes into it that
doesn't the lunar pole do something to
[SPEAKER_01]: water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but these are super minor things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of dietists like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's thousands of diet books,
and people swear by certain diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with nutrition in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They swear by certain ratios of nutrition,
whereas we go by just principles of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this consistent with the principles
that we know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce, this is our 100th video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way, is there any moments that
stand out from filming these videos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly one of them is that myths of
cannabis lighting video that went viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first experience of something,
doing something that became popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you realize that it's not just a
number on the screen, but if 1% of those
[SPEAKER_01]: people send me emails, I get a lot of
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just elaborate on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't possibly respond to all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: My graduate students reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: That led to us teaching a course at the
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting ready to teach the third
edition of this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the Science and Technology of
Medical Cannabis Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a big hit with people that
really want to dig deep and get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology and genetics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it, Bruce, that you got into
research and studying and even starting a
[SPEAKER_00]: company and building sensors?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that all happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: People sometimes have asked how I get
started and what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in a very rural area of
Painesville, Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked on farms as a kid, but my family
ran a resort, a family entrepreneurial
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody worked in the resort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until I got to college,
I started college in engineering because I
[SPEAKER_01]: was good at math and high school,
so you do engineering and mechanical and
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, the students I was there
with were pretty straight arrow engineers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stereotype is a white shirt and a
narrow black tie or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sharp pencils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pocket pull-up pencils and maybe a pocket
protector and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a class in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The subject matter fascinated me,
but I think I was also drawn by the kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of students that were in that class.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were interested in ecology and lots
of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed my major at some point and
started to just do more plant biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I went to graduate school in plant
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant biology, horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: More specifically, I always wanted to go
to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just mystique of there's no
absolute truths in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reevaluate everything every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That to me as a teenager was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into UC Davis to graduate school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I really dug into physiology and
things, but I was always interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it was a synthesis of the
engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you build a box to control the
environment to make plants grow faster?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so intriguing with the control
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, it wasn't a thing to grow food
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a research tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd build these and we'll understand how
to modify the environment, how do plants
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote a paper in a class on this
specialized greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the Morning Glory
Greenhouse, but it had big reflective
[SPEAKER_01]: panels that closed at night and opened in
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all the energy and it produced a
lot of heat because it reflected in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could heat all these buildings with
the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at night, they closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That paper, which was for a class,
got picked up by a journal called
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternative Sources of Energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, we'd like to publish this
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before computers and it had all
these calculations and hand-drawn
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got published.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that led to me getting an offer for
an assistantship or research assistantship
[SPEAKER_01]: at Penn State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off I go between California and
Pennsylvania to get a PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was focused on controlled environment
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That led to me getting a position at Utah
State University, coming here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have more money to do more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a big grant funded by NASA early in
my career and that launched a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, wow, we're doing this stuff for NASA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the way, measuring light was huge
because of all the environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters, we can measure temperature,
humidity, CO2 better than the plants can
[SPEAKER_01]: sense them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But light, the plants sense that better
than our best instruments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, there was a really great opportunity
to do precision light measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sensors were expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, well, I'm going to fiddle
around with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built, not even in my garage,
at my kitchen table, built some light
[SPEAKER_01]: meters with photodiodes and modified
voltmeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just built them for my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have a background in
understanding electronics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had enough of an engineering background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew Ohm's law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vehicles IR.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I do resistors?
[SPEAKER_01]: People came to visit the lab and we had
these sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you build me one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built them one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I start to get phone calls from
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw this sensor, this meter in
somebody's lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you build me one?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know me, but I'll pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to the university and I said,
well, there's a market here for these
[SPEAKER_01]: meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to build them the meters at
home and sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to set up a separate account
to keep track of the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the university said, no, you can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want the liability issues and we
don't want the criticism that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: competing unfairly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the solution is we'll help you start a
company and we'll give you space in our
[SPEAKER_01]: research park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what that meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take half the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, no, I'm going to keep making
them at my kitchen table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it grew and had to build a new
garage, much bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were in my garage for eight or ten
years for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we weren't trying to grow fast,
but we kept and then we just got too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we built this much nicer building
and it's gone from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no bank loan.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I put thousands of dollars of my
own money into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a bank loan to pay back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, there was the whole
company and all the early employees
[SPEAKER_01]: started just with the passion to build
good meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people really like your cannabis
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get involved with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had a reputation for doing
precise work in highly controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis growers came to us and said in
North America and the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need help growing a better quality
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all the infrastructure to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we give you funding to do cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And until 2018, the university,
my lab at the university said,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, we can't take their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get in big trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in December 2017, I think that was the
exact month and year that the farm bill
[SPEAKER_01]: passed and it made low THC cannabis legal,
federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's commonly called hemp,
but we just call it low THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get high from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that moment, the university said,
OK, now it's we'll take the money to work
[SPEAKER_01]: on low THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a license both from the state
of Utah and from the USDA to do this and
[SPEAKER_01]: much more security, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off we go with funding from growers,
because at the time there's no federal
[SPEAKER_01]: funding, there's no state funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in a normal place.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like me get money with public
agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are private companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started doing a lot of research,
applying all the things we know to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, some of my colleagues said,
oh my, this is a brand new crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting from zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, no, this is the crop like any
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the same biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the same photoperiod requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the things that are unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps us focus the research on
things that we didn't know that were
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that led to some pretty
rapid progress in publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty soon you're getting invited to
conferences to speak on this because you
[SPEAKER_01]: went from nothing to the expert because
the bar was so low.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't anybody else working on this
at universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big jumpstart for the
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have continued to do the NASA
research all along.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the NASA research is purely food crops
and the cannabis research is just
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through your research, did you ever
have something that popped up and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, this is interesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the public thinks science
progresses when people say, Eureka,
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phrase that I think is the most common
is looking at data and go, hmm,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did this happen like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the ability to say, this is not
just experimental error, there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: here that's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any of those moments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they happen all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorite quotes is from
Louis Pasteur.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, chance favors the prepared mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you know what you're looking
for, you could look at patterns of data
[SPEAKER_01]: and separate experimental error from novel
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bruce, right now, as a researcher and
the owner, of Apogee, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions do you have at night?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of things keep you up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, many.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're often driven by growers that
they call with things that can't be
[SPEAKER_01]: explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them you can explain,
many you can, but their responses you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't always your own data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somebody else's data that we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those lead us to do tests on those
things, which of course helps those
[SPEAKER_01]: growers enormously.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of complex interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a really good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew from reading the literature from
60 to 70 years ago that there was evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis was exceptionally sensitive
to light pollution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people can sleep with the lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have it all dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's intuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some plants, they can have the
lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some plants got to have it dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it suggested cannabis was
exquisitely sensitive to light pollution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start doing some tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, we confirmed this old research,
which hadn't been done for a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how are you going to measure this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those are instruments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that led to Apogee building this light
pollution detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where that came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody measures light in what we
call micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 10 to the minus 6 moles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden we build a meter to
measure nanomoles, 10 to minus 9,
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand times more sensitive to measure
these and quantify them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been a huge help to growers who
need what we call reagent grade darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: At night, you know, that's an interesting
term that we coined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poinsettia is a real sensitive crop to
light pollution, too, to make the blacks
[SPEAKER_01]: turn red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real common crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always said they are our most
sensitive crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we've shown cannabis even more
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bruce, for taking the time and
filming with me for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about Bruce and
his research, click on this playlist and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll show you more of the things that
he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taught us and you can learn a lot
from him as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for coming,
Bruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
