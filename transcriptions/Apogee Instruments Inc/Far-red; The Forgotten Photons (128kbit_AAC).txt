[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, Professor of Crop
Physiology at Utah State University and
[SPEAKER_00]: also President of Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today at the Apogee Instruments
studio to talk about our recent research
[SPEAKER_00]: on far-red photon effects on plant growth
and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an emerging field that's red hot
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies are putting far-red LEDs into
fixtures and it's based on our work and
[SPEAKER_00]: that of some other laboratories that have
clearly shown some value of far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this seminar I'm calling this
far-red the forgotten photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're barely visible to the human eye
and yet they have powerful effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth that we're just discovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed these effects for so many years
because electric lights don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to put them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight is loaded with far-red photons
but it wasn't until we got LEDs and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially a far-red LED that's very
efficient that can be added to electric
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this work is both fascinating from the
standpoint of fundamental photobiology and
[SPEAKER_00]: also has immediate significant commercial
implications because we can manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: both photosynthesis and plant shape with
these far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to show this prism breaking up
the colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who know Pink Floyd,
you know where this came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the far-red, I like to show this,
it's right on this edge right here of just
[SPEAKER_00]: the edge of visible light and that's what
we're going to talk about in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge two of my colleagues
that have done this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the trenches day-to-day making
the measurements and we meet every single
[SPEAKER_00]: day, discuss the data, what the next
studies we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is Xu Yangzhen who started
as a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now a research scientist in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has done the measurements on
photosynthesis and especially canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis and then also Paul Kusuma
who came to us from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, Kevin Foltes' lab there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done the research on plant shape from
far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our work has been funded primarily by
NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They funded the lab for over 30 years for
some very basic studies and now more
[SPEAKER_00]: recently the USDA has funded our research
through what's called the LAMP project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting approaches to maximize profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic funding agency, applied funding
agency and the interaction between those
[SPEAKER_00]: has really helped us understand the value
of far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you another graph of where the
far-red photons lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the colors of light all the way
from blue to far-red and you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's put some dots dotted lines on here,
the cutoffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our traditional definition of
photosynthesis doesn't start counting
[SPEAKER_00]: photons until, let's get some black,
until right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at 400 we start counting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have evidence these photons are useful
too but for now we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: just the far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here on the edge of our vision
we're talking about these photons right in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the effect on plant growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to review, we typically break up
light into three categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue, green and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be talking about the effects of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out these are 100 nanometer
increments but it really works well to
[SPEAKER_00]: break them up into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently studying different
wavelengths of blue but the green,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the green, includes yellow
transitioning to orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that whole thing green but it
turns out it works really well to break
[SPEAKER_00]: the light up into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to start with is a story
and it's a story of a study that Shuyang
[SPEAKER_00]: did with four growth chambers where we did
canopy photosynthesis on the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: gave them different colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the four chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them had white light from white
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them had magenta or purple light
from red and blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the input of photons to each.
[SPEAKER_00]: 300, 350, 300, 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we looked at this chart without
prior knowledge of far-red photons how
[SPEAKER_00]: would you say the lettuce grew?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study with lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you'd say, let's see if we
can show this in red, is that these by
[SPEAKER_00]: virtue of having higher light would have
higher yield and these would be less.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were a believer in red and blue
photons for photosynthesis you would say
[SPEAKER_00]: that this would grow the best and this
would be second and these would be third
[SPEAKER_00]: and fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look how the data comes out for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two were exactly equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've normalized the fresh weight and
the dry weight to a hundred for these to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no difference in growth when we
went from purple or magenta light to white
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should not be a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we know that green photons are
just as good as any other color for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis and I'm going to discuss
that more in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look just at those two
chambers and the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two chambers grew even better in
this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suddenly look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: 27% better, 35% better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just opposite of our intuition
where we thought this would be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: and this would be the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a mechanism for why this should
be the best and grew better than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I didn't tell you is that these two
chambers had 50 micromoles per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared per second of far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 350, 300 plus 50, this got 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total here is 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: All four chambers had the exact same
photon flux if you count the far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do far-red photons cause photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First let's take a look at these two
chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do white lights grow plants equally well
to magenta lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a long history of now of people
saying pink houses with this blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say this is a plant growth light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not efficient for photosynthesis
because the green photons just bounce off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 2002 edition of the plant
physiology book that I use in class.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this book say about red and blue
and green light?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2002, that's 17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is absorption of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really strong absorption in blue,
less in the green, strong absorption in
[SPEAKER_00]: the red, says chlorophyll absorbs minimum
green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true statement and that resulted in
people making lights with just red and
[SPEAKER_00]: blue because of this powerful absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: By chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sunlight is loaded with green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really wasted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump ahead to the 2015 version of
this book, which is the current version.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Taiz and Zeiger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's on the sixth edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we turn to the exact same page of
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new pigments in here and then now
it says multiple pigments absorb radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: from 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is still a little misleading
because this pigment, Ficarithrin,
[SPEAKER_00]: is only found in algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the chlorophyll absorption,
even though it's low in here on this
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, is enough to penetrate the leaves
and cause excellent photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd like to show you briefly is the
effects of these colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This summarizes a big part of my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: To categorize these, remember we got blue,
green, red, and now far-red summary of
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our dark side of the moon,
spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue photons inhibit cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds terrible, but when it's stem
elongation, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: More blue, shorter plants and that's
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if it's smaller leaves, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the most fundamental effect of
blue photons is to inhibit stem
[SPEAKER_00]: elongation, but they also inhibit leaf
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green are far more valuable than we once
thought because they are very effective
[SPEAKER_00]: for photosynthesis and they facilitate
human vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to this slide right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cannabis grown under red and blue
LEDs and white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our experience working in the lab is that
these are tremendously valuable for
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there to see microscopic insects,
subtle nutritional disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They penetrate deep in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see these dark areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very difficult to understand the
health of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can turn those off and turn on
whites, but you don't see surgeons working
[SPEAKER_00]: under dim white light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have bright white light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found that really helps diagnose
subtle disorders on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still slightly more efficient
electrically, but the difference is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is maybe 10% more electrically
efficient than this, but this has the
[SPEAKER_00]: clear advantage for being able to diagnose
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little sidebar from our quest to
understand far-red photons, but it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: important sidebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhibit cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the opposite of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They enhance cell expansion and that
effect is so powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's LED lettuce with white light with
no far-red and with 10% far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just jumped ahead of myself to show
you what's going on in our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: With those far-red photons, but this
enhancement of cell expansion is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how well photons penetrate leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful study by Broderson and
Vogelmann 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at a side view of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much absorption by chlorophyll
it doesn't penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penetrates the whole leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the top of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get a green color here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the top of the leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bottom of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green beautifully penetrates the leaf
through the spongy mesophyll all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big value of green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red, similar to blue, absorbed by
chlorophyll, absorbed in the top layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also penetrates the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these effects only become apparent when
we study whole plants and especially plant
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, but this is a nice slide
showing the penetrating effects of these
[SPEAKER_00]: colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better growth here, better growth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What caused that better growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get a result like this,
that's sort of unbelievable because if
[SPEAKER_00]: these don't cause photosynthesis,
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, this is fresh mass and dry
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've very carefully measured this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go back to Carl Sagan,
who popularized a phrase that I think all
[SPEAKER_00]: of us would be good to remember when we're
doing these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary
proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: With far-red enhances lettuce growth,
we need extraordinary proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from, first of all,
the McCree curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of Keith McCree.
[SPEAKER_00]: He died five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's his famous curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the McCree curve, he shows these
cutting off so fast that these photons are
[SPEAKER_00]: of minimal value, but as terrific as a
scientist as McCree, McCree was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to know him personally early in my
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a physicist that came across to
help biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only had primitive tools to make this
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't have the LEDs we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had prisms and filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had low light levels and he only could
study one color at a time and on a single
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a terrific piece of work and his
papers are a masterpiece of writing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're limited because he couldn't
study synergistic effects of multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: colors of light at once on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a diagram of what happens with
photons flowing through the light
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, this is shown with a lot of
biochemistry, but I really like physical
[SPEAKER_00]: diagrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a man-wife team, I guess,
moving photons through what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystem 1 and photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They first come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes four photons to excite these four
electrons to a higher energy state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where water is split in
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they get this photon, roll it down
this platform and this mill turns and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first step, really valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they get to another platform and we
need four more photons to excite four
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons up here to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four electrons in a very high
state and now we put them in a bucket and
[SPEAKER_00]: this makes NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination of ATP and NADPH,
very high energy compounds, are what
[SPEAKER_00]: causes photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, because of the way
we discovered these, photosystem 2 comes
[SPEAKER_00]: first and then photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a trick question for students on
plant physiology exams.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 comes first.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have known since the 1950s and
the time of Emerson that far-red photons
[SPEAKER_00]: also are effective right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that work helped us understand
there's two photosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The far-red photons can substitute for the
traditionally photosynthetic photons here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only if we have we'll call it white
light photons on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far-red photons, all by themselves,
are not effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that, but it's easy to give
far-red photons synergistically with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice, easy-to-remember diagram
of how photons turn into energy and then
[SPEAKER_00]: all this energy is used to fix CO2 into
sucrose in plants, but the point is
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a very fundamental law that
underlies all of this and this law relates
[SPEAKER_00]: not only to photosynthesis, but it relates
to solar panels and for that matter it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to human vision in the retina of
our eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Emerson enhancement effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This law is called the Stark-Einstein law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stark helped explain Einstein's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both get credit for it and here it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: One photon excites one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: A simple law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four photons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get four electrons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four more photons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get four more electrons up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a remarkable law and it links the
photosynthetic value of photons to human
[SPEAKER_00]: vision and to solar cells and really all
of biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the system works and this is
why far-red photons can act
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistically with white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a closer look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is our definition of photosynthetic
photons correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this work we put lettuce in those
gas exchange chambers that I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: and gave them supplemental far-red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just exactly how we did the study
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the traditional photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the far-red right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We normally wouldn't count them for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we gave them only white light we get
this kind of curve for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gross photosynthesis, a curve that
is slightly nonlinear because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting up to high light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we start adding far-red photons to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not counting them but they made
photosynthesis go up and we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: counting them as photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you explain that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need another graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the graph where we count photons
all the way to 750 and now those photons
[SPEAKER_00]: fall perfectly on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is powerful evidence that our
definition of photosynthetic photons needs
[SPEAKER_00]: revision to count far-red photons,
particularly in canopy photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: where they penetrate the canopy and they
have a bigger effect than they might have
[SPEAKER_00]: in a single leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this happen in all species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we want convincing evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want extraordinary proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that only works in lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xu Yangzhen has now done this in something
like 20 species, spinach, basil,
[SPEAKER_00]: kale, different kinds of lettuce,
C4 crops like corn, sunflower,
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens the same in every species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single species those far-red photons
are equally valuable to traditionally
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the commercial implication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a paper at the end of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got published in the journal Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people show the flux of photons like
this in an energy basis and here's far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very good but energy doesn't cause
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy doesn't cause plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's photons and these are low-energy
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take this data and re-graph it for
photon flux, look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The far-red photons are almost equal to
the reds and the blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: These violets are coming on fast too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a subject of another talk but the
far-red photons are very effective so now
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use those commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only can we use them for photobiology
but we can use them commercially to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're photosynthetic, this shows why
these should all be equal because they
[SPEAKER_00]: cause photosynthesis but they weren't
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two are even better than those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets us in to plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Paul Kasuma's work now and this is
the response of plants to shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plants are in the bright sun,
they have plenty of visible photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue, green, and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they're in the sun but when
they're in the shade, over here underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: this tree, they have a lot of far-red
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the graph of the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very enriched.
[SPEAKER_00]: When plants perceive a high amount of
far-red, they panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're under shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to do one of two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get tall fast to get into the light or get
bigger to capture more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's growing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called a shade-avoider plant
because it's getting tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is called a shade-tolerator
plant because it's getting big.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can trick plants that are not in the
shade to think that, we could make them
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a traditional plant in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly what happens with lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lettuce gets big like this because of
it being tricked by far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shade avoidance, shade tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big picture of that lettuce and
the value of far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was with just a little bit more
far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tricked this lettuce plant into
thinking it was in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a powerful picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all anxious to use far-red for
indoor agriculture on lettuce to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have said this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be giving far-red to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that far-red also increases stem
elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants could be shade-avoiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the results from multiple
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a top view of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No far-red, far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same slide as the last one only
shows you the dramatic benefit of far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, both because of photosynthesis
and because of expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, the photosynthetic photons were
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed those for photosynthesis,
but they not only grew equally,
[SPEAKER_00]: they grew better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give the same amount of far-red photons
to tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: More stem elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very undesirable in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we don't grow soybeans in
controlled environments, but they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: great test species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made soybeans panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a good effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumbers makes cucumbers tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a good effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some evidence as leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help with leaf expansion in
spinach too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For leafy greens, the addition of far-red
is great, but it's a powerful tool because
[SPEAKER_00]: we could use it a little bit when the
plants are young.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use it at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this flower right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can highlight this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put that one in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's evidence that far-red light can
help plants flower sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this seminar has helped explain
from our results the tremendous value of
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, we have quantum sensors to
measure photosynthetic photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those quantum sensors don't measure
this far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to measure it, you need a
spectroradiometer, which is terrific,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that jumps up the price and complexity
considerably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, Apogee has developed a
sensor that has both red and far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: detectors in the same sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps us measure traditionally
photosynthetic photons and, in a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement, far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you again in another video.
