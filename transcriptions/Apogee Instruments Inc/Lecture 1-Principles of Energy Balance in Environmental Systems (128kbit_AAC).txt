[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be different because this
is a higher level class than beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate students because most of you have
already had exposure to some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to solidify the basics and then
go into more depth as we come up on
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should introduce myself like I
do to all the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee and this is more for the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: My title is professor of crop physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere along the line I got much more
interested in the physics of plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: than the physiology and that means energy
and mass transfer into and out of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and because of that my laboratory has done
well with getting funding because people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to quantify things and many many
years ago that led to a lot of instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: to rigorously quantify inputs and outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've evolved to now is instrument
intensive research on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some students have called this class in
the reviews, some students have called
[SPEAKER_00]: this class crop physics that you should
just call it crop physics because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is and that's not strictly correct
because there's a lot of biology in the
[SPEAKER_00]: class as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to focus on in
approximately the next eight lectures is
[SPEAKER_00]: this outline here which I've handed out
which focuses on energy balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first part of the class and it's
the fundamentals by which we get
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation from surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a point of introduction and before I
get way too far into this I thought I
[SPEAKER_00]: would give you a full copy of the whole
class that I teach and you can see we're
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning off these early lectures right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach this winter semesters up here but
we're pruning off these this first section
[SPEAKER_00]: up here on energy balance but this is the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also the front page of the
textbook I use which is a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: readings of this and I love to put all the
key equations right on the front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: book so people can see those and see
what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly the top half of these things are
the ones we're going to focus on in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we do energy balance analysis
in any field is to try and determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of objects and anytime water
is involved now it gets way more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated because water evaporates and
changes the temperature of objects which
[SPEAKER_00]: is why agriculture focuses on energy
balance so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could get a low-cost sensor that
could measure the evaporation of water
[SPEAKER_00]: from a field it would be a huge
breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put it out there and measure the flux
of water but there isn't any low-cost ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that so we do it with modeling and
lots of modeling and we measure all the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters around this and what's left is
this missing water and this much water
[SPEAKER_00]: must have evaporated to balance the
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most cost-effective way to do
it and frankly that's a big reason
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument companies are in business
because they sell instruments to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put plants on a lysimeter and weigh
them and that's an accurate way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: water that evaporates but lysimeters are
really expensive to install, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive to operate and only people that
use those as references use lysimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of us use calculations and
modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use lysimeters as well but only for
reference instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do things like eddy covariance to
get water transfer and that's still
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and requires knowledgeable
people and that's still an indirect
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement of measuring water vapor so we
keep coming back to energy balance
[SPEAKER_00]: principles to really understand where the
water is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you type in water use in the world on
the internet you get lots of things like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture is 70% of our water in the
United States and worldwide it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: massive user of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a TED talk on this a few years ago
turning water into food and the main point
[SPEAKER_00]: in that talk was people aren't wasting
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image is if farmers are using 70% of
our water they must be just wasting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: running it down into rivers and into the
groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes that much water to grow food
and this is one of many graphs of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: the point is if we could improve water use
efficiency in agriculture by 1% it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be more than what you use at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget putting bricks in your toilet and
turning the water off when you brush your
[SPEAKER_00]: teeth, those are just minuscule compared
to the amount of water that it takes to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow our food which is why it's so
imperative to understand that and use
[SPEAKER_00]: every drop as efficiently as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that more crop per drop,
that effort, and it takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments to get that analyzed and it
takes a lot of rigorous and careful
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical development to make sure we've
got it right because so many cases are
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need oxygen to run our respiration
and you think what's a person's water use
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, what's our personal water use
efficiency and you calculate how much
[SPEAKER_00]: water do we exhale and how much food we
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the reverse of plants but people have
it easy because there's 21% oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air and we don't have to breathe very much
and therefore we don't lose much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have to work on 0.04% CO2 in the
air so for plants to breathe they got to
[SPEAKER_00]: have their stomates wide open and the
water diffuses out into the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could start this by writing what I think
is the most important equation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and you ask people what that is and
maybe it's E equals MC squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me the most important equation in the
world is
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's subscripts on these C6,
H12 but this is the basic, the simple
[SPEAKER_00]: stoichiometry so the plants in
photosynthesis are taking this low energy
[SPEAKER_00]: gas that we use to put out fires and
turning it into carbohydrate, a high
[SPEAKER_00]: energy solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing that they do that and
again if this is 20.95% the oxygen and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is 0.04% the CO2 so not only are they
taking a low energy gas but it's a trace
[SPEAKER_00]: gas, it's minuscule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said if you took the molecules in
here and turned them colors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in the air, if that was say black
and the oxygen was red, now try and see
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably wouldn't even be able to see
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're such a trace gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is four out of every 10,000 molecules
is CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the plants are having to work
with so they got to keep their stomates
[SPEAKER_00]: wide open to get that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can breathe with not having to
exhale much water vapor because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As my friend and colleague Rick Allen
says, it's a good thing plants don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go anywhere because as soon as they
start to move they get out of breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course this is going the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's photosynthesis, here's respiration
but this low gas is really the fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: reason we have to give so much water to
plants so they can make our food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts it in perspective of the stakes
in this thing trying to optimize every
[SPEAKER_00]: drop of that massive amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it was honored to be able to
give a TED talk and talk about this issue
[SPEAKER_00]: of where all the water is going in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to start this I'm going to start
with
[SPEAKER_00]: another important equation, the energy
balance equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said in the outline the multiple
components of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's leave that up here for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's even start before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First law of thermodynamics, energy E in
equals E out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to erase this top part here for
a minute because these are different
[SPEAKER_00]: principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is easily the most widely known and
to me by far the most profound of the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: of thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really three laws of
thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy has to balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is the world tends to more
entropy meaning more randomness in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The planets are moving apart and the
world's becoming more random, lower
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one has to do with absolute
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you get closer to absolute zero the
energy in the system approaches zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why that law just doesn't say
at absolute zero everything stops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says as you approach absolute zero you
get less energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some British chemist said about these
three laws, he said the first one you
[SPEAKER_00]: could say there's no free lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way to say this,
but he said you can't win because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second law is you can't even break
even because the world tends to lower
[SPEAKER_00]: entropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth law, you can't even get out of
the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't quit the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always at some temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on this, energy in,
energy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away if we can measure these
components we can calculate the missing
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the simplest sense if this is radiation
in, so for now we'll do R for radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here we have transpiration plus
conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these different people use different
symbols for these, but I have typically
[SPEAKER_00]: used C squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: For conduction and convection we consider
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the heat go into the molecules and
the molecules blown away, but they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: one turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't mathematically mean C times
C.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means there's CC, C squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the essence of this whole energy
balance equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have to balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we have whole textbooks on this
thing to analyze this if it's this simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is reduced to the simplest
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any good plant person is going to say,
wait a minute, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's photosynthesis in this and some of
the energy goes into photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here we have P for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some of the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting a little more
complicated and more detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me stop right here and make a
mention about some of the principles for
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many books talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start with a different book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much every university teaches plant
physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they're an agriculture land-grant
school or anything related to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year new editions of new plant
physiology textbooks come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Taizenzeiger one we use here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open up this fat treatise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets thicker every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find energy balance analysis in
this textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a traditional part of plant
physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This deals with chemical principles and it
deals with single leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets to calculating
evapotranspiration, that's not a subject
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do cover what causes stomaids to open
and close, which is a key part of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do mention water use efficiency in
here, but they don't talk about covering
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of other books do.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites that I learned this
stuff from and fortunately it's now in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth edition is this book by Park Nobel,
Physiochemical and Environmental Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The principles of what I'm talking about
are in this book in chapter seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the same symbols as he does in this
book, so it's a great reference for
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought with me a few other key books
that have been important to me and also
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about these principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that many people are familiar with is
Galen Campbell's book and John Norman,
[SPEAKER_00]: An Introduction to Environmental
Biophysics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got a lot of great stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows basic equations for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a good reference on these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hamlin-Jones, Plants and Microclimate,
A Quantitative Approach to Environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time somebody puts quantitative
approach in the title, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: students go, I'm going to try to avoid
that class, and the other students go,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, this is cool, I've got to sign up for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how good people are with
quantitative approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a third one, Environmental
Physiology, Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This subject matter is covered in many
books, it's just not covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional plant physiology textbooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to our equation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting in photosynthesis because
some of the energy goes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we were doing energy balance
analysis of ourselves, which we do,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're standing out in the sun,
we've got radiation in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to drink water to stay
hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get hot, you lose heat by
conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis, for most of us,
is approaching zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still working on that chlorophyll gene
so I can stand out in the sun and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to get green skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies are above room temperature
because of respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got respiration in here and in
the case of plants, so do they have
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they respire, that's exothermic,
that warms them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because respiration is adding to the
heat, we really have to do something like
[SPEAKER_00]: minus respiration because it's giving off
heat that's not using it any time we burn
[SPEAKER_00]: up heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those four components are the essence of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The four on this side but what happens
when something changes temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy in equals energy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This balances over long time periods but
if you take a black piece of metal and
[SPEAKER_00]: walk out in the sunlight out there and lay
it out, it's going to get hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get hot fast and this won't
balance because it's heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the energy is going in to change
the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we bring that back into the room and
it's cooling down and we got all our
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred instruments around this thing and
energy doesn't balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cooling off because it doesn't
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have another term over here and
that's usually called G and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storage is easy that's either heating up
or cooling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of a leaf, and my analysis is
going to do a single leaf now,
[SPEAKER_00]: just one leaf out there in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to make the energy
balance for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a leaf right and then we can go to
bigger things, canopies and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much goes into photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just start with a rough estimate of
the size of these parameters up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you, how efficient is
photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, you ought to know this from some
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the efficiency of photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say that in the test tube algae
can be this good, in the field they're
[SPEAKER_00]: this good, but about how efficient is
photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get any idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Austin, do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very dang efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than 50%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than 20%?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be, yes, photosynthesis can be up
to 30% efficient in a test tube with algae
[SPEAKER_00]: in perfect conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we go to the field, we're talking
more like 5% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It obviously varies if it's how bright the
light is, there's a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, but let's just go with 5% here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means 95% of the action is somewhere
else in this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if photosynthesis is 5%, how much
energy comes out in respiration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in people, it's energy balance in
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The food you eat, that's how much energy
you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to balance in food too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we ate 5 grams of food, we'd have 5
grams of respiration, but in plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing, respiration is typically a
third of photosynthesis because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: storing energy as they get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So respiration might be 2% if we can see
those lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're getting down to some terms
that are pretty small here, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: storage is in a single leaf storage is
insignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see if I can draw a
three-dimensional leaf here, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the calculations in Park Nobel's
book is how much a leaf could store,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much energy a leaf could store given
the magnitude of the radiation coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he shows mathematically it's
insignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A leaf is so thin, there's not much mass
there, and 50% of a leaf is air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf is just a bunch of cells with air in
between them, and it's a fraction of a
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter thick, so in a single leaf we
just ignore storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is absolutely not true as soon as
soil enters the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil now is huge, but when we're talking
about the leaves of plants, storage is
[SPEAKER_00]: insignificant, and both of these are tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can easily calculate this one too
because... Let me draw a graph of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about this efficiency of
photosynthesis for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I draw a graph, I'm going to do this in
a different color here, of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love drawing XY plots, so I get a lot of
XY plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I think I dream in XY plots,
but here's radiation in, and here's zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's dark, and we get up here to...
Let's say we get up here to 1,000 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically full sunlight in a summer
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now normally we do this graph with just
photosynthetic radiation with photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for these purposes this is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got energy coming in, and over here
we're going to have photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's another thing that people
understand the shape of this graph at
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was a high school class,
the correct answer to that question,
[SPEAKER_00]: if somebody said it looks like that,
they'd probably get full credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's wrong with this straight line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that not full credit for a more
advanced class?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can't keep going, it tops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part's wrong, so it tops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're up to plant science 301,
and that's the correct answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not correct for plant science
501, or whatever number we're putting on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's still wrong about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we put a plant in the dark,
reagent grade darkness right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not plastic plants, they're real
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them in the dark, they have
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put the plant in the dark,
and this is zero, it has to go somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line has to curve like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that line is correct at plant science
501.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this dynamic down here at zero,
and we've got the flat line as a general
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get these 5% numbers, we're
usually somewhere, I'll put this in green,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're usually somewhere on this part of
the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early part of the curve, where we get
higher photosynthesis, by the time we get
[SPEAKER_00]: out to full sun, and we're out here,
now we're down to maybe 2% efficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: full sun, because it just tops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say 5%, yeah, it's correct if
the sun's not too bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the efficiency is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This and here's 5%, and that slope with
that line is more like 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of this transpiration,
which is what we're ultimately after in
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing, is happening during the bright
light parts of the day, and the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: this is we can ignore it for the first
order estimates of transpiration and
[SPEAKER_00]: conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times when a refined analysis
will include photosynthesis, but typically
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we're just dealing with this
part right here, even though that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: full equation as it relates to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can put numbers on this,
quickly put numbers on this, and the sum
[SPEAKER_00]: of these two boxes has to equal this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a very quick calculation and I
just love back-of-the-envelope
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations, and the goal of this class
is to get everybody to where every time
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody asks a question they go,
hmm, you got some paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can calculate stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of things you can
calculate if you get started and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say we have radiation in 1,000
watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a nice number to remember
because right now that's about the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation outside this classroom coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say our leaf right here is
evaporating to be anatomically correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water always has to be shown in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leaf is evaporating enough water to
stay exactly at the same temperature as
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a wet dish rag on your
clothesline, a black dish rag maybe to
[SPEAKER_00]: simulate a leaf, and you measure the
temperature of that, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty close to air temperature because
it's evaporating water at the same rate as
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy is coming in, and in fact a
very wet dish rag is pretty often below
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as soon as it starts to dry out,
now it's still evaporating water but it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes above air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conduction and convection is zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the same, if this leaf is 25
degrees C and the air is 25 degrees C,
[SPEAKER_00]: that exchange is zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've really simplified this energy
balance analysis to see where we're at
[SPEAKER_00]: because we got a hundred watts coming in,
zero is here, how much water does it
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So take off this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you find out in this analysis is a
huge part of it is just units conversion
[SPEAKER_00]: from getting one unit to the next,
getting them all straightened out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and once you get that then I tell people a
monkey could do the last part of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a computer can do the last part of it
to get the units right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to know is transpiration
and what we know is energy coming in So
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start by looking up, here we go,
a typical number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put this over here, I can even zoom
in, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much zoom in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out of this book right here,
you talk about climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's published by the Climate Center and
it's just a bunch of statistics of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example here, I have pulled out
the campus weather station.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 30-year data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not our new environmental
observatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an older station, real old,
up by the place you buy ice cream up
[SPEAKER_00]: there, nutrition and food science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's every month of the year
evapotranspiration, inches per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to take the highest
transpiration month of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.48 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is per month and that is 0.24 inches
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 0.6 centimeters a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is measured by, I think this one,
this is measured by pan evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a pan with water in it and looking
how much water evaporates in that pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old time-honored simple method to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pan evaporation, we get a number right
here, equals 0.6 centimeters per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is supposed to balance,
but we don't have the units in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: order yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to put the units in the right order,
there's one key number that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably have tattooed on your arm so you
could always remember this number,
[SPEAKER_00]: LHE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latent heat of evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this number enough I can remember
it, 2.45 megajoules per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is close to a constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water is almost boiling,
this is something like 2.41 and if the
[SPEAKER_00]: water is freezing, it's something like
2.49, but it's 2.45 megajoules per liter
[SPEAKER_00]: at 25 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really this temperature doesn't matter
that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is up to three significant digits,
all of them round off to 2.45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay great, but neither liters nor
megajoules is in this equation yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this first lecture I want to take
some units and see if this is zero,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we do this conversion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to erase my photosynthesis
and we're still talking about our leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thousand watts is coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a real simple physical
principle, but it trips people up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A watt is a rate of energy flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people could probably answer on a
test, a watt is a joule per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have this happen so much rates
of energy, we just have this nickname for
[SPEAKER_00]: them called the watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it trips people up sometimes and think
the whole thing would be simpler if we
[SPEAKER_00]: always just said joules per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going back and forth in this is really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways to help think about this
is if we had a gallon of gas sitting here
[SPEAKER_00]: and you said how many watts are in that
gallon of gas?
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody whips out their phone and
they say watts in a gallon of gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say I can't find it, I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you said how much energy is in that
gallon of gas, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the energy in a gallon of gas
out of six to the tenth bajillion joules
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy in a gallon of gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I light a match and I blow it up,
it is six bazillion watts of power because
[SPEAKER_00]: it blew up in one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watt is a rate of energy like release
or energy transfer and joules is the
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental unit of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's put this down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1000 joules per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're dealing with centimeters a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see a conversion I need to make
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the maximum rate of energy coming
in in the middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the total water for the whole
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here we got seconds and over here
we got days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put another curve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is noon, solar noon, and up here this
is a thousand watts per meter squared,
[SPEAKER_00]: the brightest we get typically in the
middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're going to compare all the
energy coming in in a day to all the water
[SPEAKER_00]: we used in a day, we have to have the area
under that curve and when we do that we
[SPEAKER_00]: get 30 mega joules per meter squared per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a full sun summer day,
30 mega joules integrated under the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for comparison, over here I'm going to
change my units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of 1000 joules, 30 mega joules per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we at least have the time on the same,
on both axes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.6 centimeters of water from a pan
evaporating to possibly keep this equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to get this meter squared
equal on both sides and to do that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take a tray, a giant cookie
sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should sell cookie sheets and one meter
squared cookie sheets for teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes because you could lay them out
and you could put water in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our reference sheet, the radiation is
coming in to that one meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we evaporate 0.6 centimeters of water,
how many liters is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: To put the liters equal, so this is a
hundred centimeters, this is a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters, so one meter squared is
10,000 centimeters squared, 10 to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This trips people up a lot because so much
stuff is 10 to the third, 10 to the third,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's multiples of 10 to the third.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is not, this is 10 to the fourth
because it's a hundred times a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then remember, another reason that the
metric system is so far superior to any
[SPEAKER_00]: other system, one centimeter cubed is one
milliliter is one gram, which everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: learns that in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do a true-false test and I say this
and this is one milligram and I put the
[SPEAKER_00]: miller really big and half the class
misses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a milliliter, but that's a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting close.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get in our units the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: One liter is 10 times 10 to 10,
1000 cubic centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: One centimeter deep, one centimeter of
water times 10 to the fourth centimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: of area is 10 to the fourth centimeters
cubed or 10,000 centimeters cubed or
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 grams and 10,000 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: One centimeter deep is 10 liters when we
do this evaporation and 0.6 centimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters per day is six liters,
I'm going to have to erase part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: meter, per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over this math pretty fast,
but it's not complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A centimeter deep on a liter tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had a liter of water and we poured
it into a meter squared tray, it'd be a
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had 10 liters of water and we poured
it in, it'd be a centimeter deep in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 0.6 centimeters a day in a meter
squared area is six liters of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 30 megajoules coming in per
meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we finally got units the same,
meter squared per day, we can cancel those
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 megajoules in six liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we bring out our latent heat of
evaporation and 30 megajoules divided by
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.45 megajoules, mega, capital M,
per liter and I think this comes out to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 12, I'm going to put about here
because it's real close, 12 liters per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how much water would have to
evaporate to keep this thing at the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same temperature as the air and what
happened in this calculation, when we
[SPEAKER_00]: measure this we only get six liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to wind up on this principle
because tomorrow we'll pick it up from
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was all that was going on,
you would then write in your notebooks,
[SPEAKER_00]: well clearly the object got hot because it
doesn't balance, it needed to evaporate 12
[SPEAKER_00]: liters of water to keep itself at air
temperature and it only evaporated these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, only evaporated six, it doesn't
balance, this cannot be zero, it heats up
[SPEAKER_00]: and you would be correct in the analysis
of this, but it's more complicated than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only shortwave radiation in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a very simple analysis,
this assumed every watt of this was
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed and some of this gets reflected,
some gets transmitted and this is only
[SPEAKER_00]: shortwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to calculate longwave radiation to
do a comprehensive analysis, so I've
[SPEAKER_00]: filled up the board, but tomorrow we'll
break down this radiation into its
[SPEAKER_00]: component parts to see how much of that
radiation actually got absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a perfect example, we do pan
evaporation to get these numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: put a pan out, measure the water
evaporating at time honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if the plant is made out of aluminum
foil and one another trays painted flat
[SPEAKER_00]: black?
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge difference in evaporation from those
two, so we got to account for the
[SPEAKER_00]: different amounts of radiation absorbed in
order to make this balance, but this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: empirical number, 0.6 centimeters a day
during the hottest month of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: around here and once we get this number
analyzed then we can start to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: partitioning between how hot the object
gets and how much water it has to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is largely driven, well it's driven
by just the temperature difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can measure the temperature
difference of this and then we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: zero in on transpiration, which like I
said we don't have any good instruments to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure that directly, but this is an
example of some simple units to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'd like to end sometimes with a
homework assignment, which I'll just tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you the homework assignments in here and
you can decide if you want to work them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said this whole thing is units
conversion, is that close enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you read that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a homework assignment I've
sometimes I've given this on the first day
[SPEAKER_00]: of class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Einstein's, it's one of the top five
most important equations in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: equals mc squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much energy is in one p seed if this
is right and how long could you live if
[SPEAKER_00]: you just ate one p seed and you could use
all the energy in that p seed and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course c squared, the speed of light
squared is a huge number so it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is about the simplest equation
you can get and now think about units
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the energy in a p seed from the
typical weight of a p and this because mc
[SPEAKER_00]: squared with si units and si unit
conversion comes out to be joules of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy in the p seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the key for this tomorrow if
you want, but the key for this is setting
[SPEAKER_00]: it up with the units and looking at this,
which I'm not going to quite stop yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: which brings me to, particularly if I can
find the handout of this, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you know si units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a nice symbol for the whole world
and si units are wonderfully simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven base units and these calculations
get immensely easier to get them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see from this example,
getting them down to base units so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: compare different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays you can look these up on the
internet, not just the base units but all
[SPEAKER_00]: the related relationships and most of them
are so simple like watt and joules per
[SPEAKER_00]: second you remember them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a little handout that I've
found useful on this for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a two-sided handout and it helps
to understand the relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we talk about energy balance,
we're only talking about a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: subset of all the units in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it helps to be fluent in the simplest
relationships of si units and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I found that's useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a second one that I found useful and
that just looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is a double-sided,
it's got some units on the back,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is just conversions among units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single beginning chemistry book has
these si units in the front and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people see those and they go yeah
yeah good and then they can forget about
[SPEAKER_00]: them for years and years and then you get
to an energy balance analysis and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember them and use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop here and we'll pick this
up tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have not hit double-sided in the
copy machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those are one side and it's the
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to copy the second side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is even worse because this one has
the same thing on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all seven units.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no two sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said two sides because I was looking at
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have two sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes a subset of the units.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have two sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first side is self-sufficient and the
next side is a subset of these with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the more common ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can copy this and I can give you the
second side tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to apply this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the purposes of the class I'm going to
introduce the seventh term tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nutshell, it's splitting radiation
into short and long wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to start with the simplest
thing and then get more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: To work this out in five or eight minutes
and see how to finally get it in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: units, that's the essence of energy
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to where it doesn't balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are our instruments not calibrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer in this particular case is the
model is not complex enough yet to account
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model needs to be more detailed to
account for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a rule of thumb, well-watered plants
stay very close to air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This term for well-watered plants is
always small.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get all the radiation right,
and this is exactly air temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we know transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got to do short and long wave both
to get that term right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they've run out of water,
of course, think imagine a cactus in the
[SPEAKER_00]: desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my students came back and said,
they were in Phoenix last week and they
[SPEAKER_00]: said, I can't see how people go from one
building as quick as they possible to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next air-conditioned building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 115 in the day, but it cooled off
to 90 at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far is my car?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine a cactus without water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tissues of that cactus are just
astronomically hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cactus has almost no transpiration in
the middle of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can run this the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if T was zero?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we run this analysis for putting a
metal hammer outside in the sun to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now try and pick up the hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hot you can't pick it up because
this is an enormous number and this one's
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the timing, I'm thinking if we do every
day this week, that's five lectures,
[SPEAKER_00]: I put eight lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I look at what I've done,
typically it's maybe more like six or
[SPEAKER_00]: seven lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I give a pretty long lecture in
the beginning about how I'm going to grade
[SPEAKER_00]: the class and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just skip all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do this whole thing by the end of
the week, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how we're at, how we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, today I tried to do,
I don't know how long was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was including the introductory stuff
that we might have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it out, but I'm going to try and do
one hour of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I did an hour and a half where we
did some and we stopped and took a little
[SPEAKER_00]: break, we could get done by the end of the
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we get into more details and
there's more questions, well, then it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take longer, but that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to weave into this the
instruments we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's a component of the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no single instrument to measure
what we want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just surround it with indirect
instruments and basically calculate it by
[SPEAKER_00]: subtraction, which is how we do
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can measure something easily,
then we just measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a whole bunch of stuff that we
can't measure, so we have to model it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration is one that's subject of all
kinds of models.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go.
All right, let's go.
