[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to Lecture 6 in this series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are up to conduction and
convection, the final component of this
[SPEAKER_01]: energy balance analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because this follows the same
principles as transpiration, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things that it takes less time to
explain these principles because it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: flux is the driving gradient divided by
the resistance, that ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember in the case of the psychometric
chart, we spent a lot of time talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to calculate the driving
gradient, the leaf-to-air vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That requires some calculations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of conduction and convection
however, this is real simple because the
[SPEAKER_01]: numerator is just the delta T,
the delta temperature between the object
[SPEAKER_01]: and the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know air temperature and you
know the surface temperature, both of
[SPEAKER_01]: which we measure, we know the numerator
for sensible heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a minute I'm going to talk about how
we calculate the resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is much more complex in
conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complex in transpiration too because
this is stomatal opening, a biological
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomena, but here it's physical
phenomena that determine that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me take a tiny sidebar before I
talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've pulled up here the environmental
observatory on the Utah State University
[SPEAKER_01]: campus and here is a live camera showing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we watch this long enough some
student will walk through the picture
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has a whole series of graphs that
demonstrate all of these principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got net radiometers, long wave,
we talked about this in a previous
[SPEAKER_01]: lecture, but here's the current past two
days of temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's some people coming by and
what's fascinating around here is this
[SPEAKER_01]: blue line is campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red line is where we're at right now,
which is the middle of the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the red line is airport CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we tell people Campbell scientific,
not everyone in the valley knows where
[SPEAKER_01]: Campbell scientific is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put airport slash CSI, but the data
from CSI is far superior to the airport
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't actually use the airport data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the CSI data, but we tell them it's
the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it says airport CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this night, like so many other nights
around here, it's just everything that our
[SPEAKER_01]: weather because of our changes in
elevation in our valley are just
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the green line, which is the top of
Logan peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone can walk outside and see this
weather station up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in July.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's finally getting warmer on Logan peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at the difference between campus
and Campbell scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're at maybe four degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four degrees C colder in the middle of the
valley last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at this night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night, we got to nine degrees C here
at Apogee and Campbell scientific,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are right together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And campus only got to 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a nine degree Celsius difference
in temperature last night, which is an
[SPEAKER_01]: inversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was colder here.
[SPEAKER_01]: An inversion would trap the air,
and potentially we'd have polluted air.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the sun came up, and it warmed it
right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few hours later, the inversion went
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the winter, these red and blue lines
get below the green line and stay there
[SPEAKER_01]: for days at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a fascinating difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens up in the top of Mount
Logan is it just never warms up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we warm up to 30 in the day,
and there they're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're barely warming up to 16 or 18 in
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows wind speed, barometric
pressure, and then solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nice clear days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see this is getting to 1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like if we looked out the window,
I guess there ought to be a few clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have this, you actually don't have
to look out the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just see what's going on outside
by looking at the graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're at 1,116.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some reflection out the clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going above our 1,000 watts per
meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where it's located on the campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at a few of these because they
demonstrate some of these principles so
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dew point and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the air temperature and the dew
point temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have dry air, so the dew point actually
is below zero some of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolute humidity, relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolute humidity has a few fluctuations,
but day and night it's generally a flat
[SPEAKER_01]: line at about five or six grams per cubic
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relative humidity down in the day,
up at night, down, cycles because of air
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you get these principles,
you just love seeing how they work and
[SPEAKER_01]: interpreting the data on this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these graphs have one day and then
you can call up the past seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on a new revision of this
that's not more sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole campus is going to a better
Internet display that will automatically
[SPEAKER_01]: scale to fill people's screens much nicer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about barometric pressure,
how much that varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is adjusted to sea level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody adjusts to sea level so we can
make maps of the pressures, the highs and
[SPEAKER_01]: lows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though this is here, it's corrected
to sea level, so the barometric pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: is going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more interesting in seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are electronic barometers,
so it goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at a real high pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going down over the past seven
days as those fronts come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most interesting things about
this station is carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's CO2 on campus, so we're coming
along here low 400 ppm and a big spike
[SPEAKER_01]: here and another big spike here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that people breathing on this sensor?
[SPEAKER_01]: People driving their cars by the sensor?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is canyon winds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The canyon winds come out of the canyon
and they have clean air right out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cache National Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that photosynthesis cleans the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look what happened here.
[SPEAKER_01]: 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wind shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here is canyon wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 degrees is coming out of the canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That canyon wind died about 7 30 this
morning and it shifted and we got a puff
[SPEAKER_01]: of wind from downtown Logan and it spiked
the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got another spike here and now finally
all the valley's clearing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see this every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The canyon wind is low CO2 because of
photosynthesis in the summer and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: canyon wind dies and the valley air shifts
up and we get a spike in CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partly that's governed by photosynthesis,
so here's the photosynthetic photon flux
[SPEAKER_01]: that drives that and then wind speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about calculating surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't realize how different
surface temperatures can be than air
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about Delta T right here for
driving conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is two replicate apogee infrared
sensors in the red and green line pointing
[SPEAKER_01]: east and west.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ground surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes this is irrigated turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump back and we'll come back to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should call up here in a second and I
can show you exactly what they're pointing
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not coming up, but they're pointing at the
irrigated turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night, and we're going to talk about
this in a minute, way below air
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, several degrees C below air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a clear night.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're radiating to outer space so they
get cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun comes up and suddenly they're
warmer and today we're only getting 4
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees C above air temperature,
but I have seen this go as high as 10
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees C above air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turf grass surface compared to the air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tells you how big these surface
temperature fluxes can be and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigated too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lush and irrigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the comparisons that we do up there
is between shields.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a graph of replicate matching tiny
yellow bead thermistors.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is in a traditional gill
shield and one of them is in an apogee
[SPEAKER_01]: aspirated shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the last 24 hours and you can
see at night they're virtually identical
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's no flux and here's the
temperature difference in the day and
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday for a little bit we had 3
degrees C difference, but most of the time
[SPEAKER_01]: it was down around to 1 degree C
difference and this is a small sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: inside that shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can track that, see the
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Net radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already talked about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all the principles and all the
calculations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is intermittent clouds going on right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's albedo of the grass up there
through the day and what did we say 0.23
[SPEAKER_01]: about for albedos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know this is just a hair above 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slightly higher in the morning and it
goes down slightly in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's 0.21 albedo of that turf
grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do you want to look at?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the unique features of this is
atmospheric visibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Campbell scientific sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time it's very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fleck of something got in there for
these downward spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 32 kilometers is the max.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's real clean air.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that we watch a lot in
the winter when we have inversions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How low does the visibility go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen this in the bad worst days of
winter to go down here to 5 and 10 and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the inversion blows out and it's
clear again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well this one is the reflection of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is these are tuned for water
and would they affect other things?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's the reflection of light off of
particles which is highly correlated with
[SPEAKER_01]: human vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Campbell scientific England people
are expecting it to pick up particles in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air, not just water vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's any kind of particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too interesting because it's
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's summer but it's pretty constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature, thermistor shield,
solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the shortwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we looked at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is multiple replicate sensors on here
and they're all reading very close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's comparison of technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This also shows power budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go through this thing but for
people understanding solar powered
[SPEAKER_01]: stations that take a lot of power,
it shows the energy going into the battery
[SPEAKER_01]: and coming out of the battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: The battery flux night and day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This station has a lot of sensors that
take a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So power management is a big deal and it's
full of algorithms to turn stuff on and
[SPEAKER_01]: off depending on power availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is made possible by the Campbell
scientific CH 200 power management system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives us a lot more data than we ever
used to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: ET and VPD which is what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's calculated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the vapor pressure deficit between
just the air and then between the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: and the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get down to less than one at night and
get up to four in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we run the Penman-Monteith equation
and here's evapotranspiration calculated
[SPEAKER_01]: through the day yesterday and today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a long discussion about ET right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows historical data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of graphs on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's air temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer, winter, summer, winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The men and max for each day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of data and combined climate data
and data that the goal is to help educate
[SPEAKER_01]: the campus community for weather data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people get interested in this and
because this has a camera you can see when
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody stands there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a touchscreen kiosk now in front
of this which has its own set of graphs
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's particularly edifying to see
students come and look at that and study
[SPEAKER_01]: the graphs and look at the sensors and
it's a great educational opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: teach people about weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to from that sidebar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to sensible heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the numerator is delta T.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resistance is determined by the
thickness of a tiny layer of dead air
[SPEAKER_01]: right next to all surfaces and everything
has that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This board has that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our skin has that and that dead air is
just like a thermal pane window.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tiny layer that resists the movement of
heat and if that layer was gone completely
[SPEAKER_01]: and the resistance approached zero things
would immediately equilibrate with the air
[SPEAKER_01]: but they never do immediately equilibrate
because of this little resistance layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we take just the resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is called resistance BL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boundary layer because it's a thickness
and what we're going to calculate is how
[SPEAKER_01]: thick this airspace is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the order of millimeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a thermal pane window might be
one to two centimeters to trap dead air.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more like one millimeter less than
a millimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not surprisingly this is inversely
proportional to wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wind speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the fundamental concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's proportional to wind but like lots of
heat transfer and a lot of principles of
[SPEAKER_01]: wind it's not directly proportional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's proportional to the square root of
wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the wind doubles heat transfer
doesn't double.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes up by the square root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a nonlinear function of wind but
there's one other parameter along with
[SPEAKER_01]: wind that's equally important in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the numerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I put proportional inversely
proportional to wind this is width.
[SPEAKER_01]: The width of the object that the wind is
blowing over and now in this analysis it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a flat object.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this for cylinders and ovals and
different shapes but for a flat object
[SPEAKER_01]: it's proportional to the width.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the width gets bigger the heat
transfer gets less and you can imagine a
[SPEAKER_01]: pine needle would have very efficient heat
transfer because it's thin and little and
[SPEAKER_01]: a banana leaf that's a meter wide would
have very bad very poor heat transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of width.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now same thing as wind it's also
proportional to the square root of width.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the two variables in this that
determine the heat transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both square roots width and wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's proportional to width now we
look at shapes of leaves and the textbook
[SPEAKER_01]: has some examples of shapes of leaves but
imagine I'm going to put this up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some giant banana leaf which would have
poor heat transfer characteristics versus
[SPEAKER_01]: some leaf that might look like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has much better heat transfer
characteristics and in fact how about a
[SPEAKER_01]: grass leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess grass over two grasses vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grasses are thin and thin grass leaves
have better heat transfer characteristics
[SPEAKER_01]: than wide dicot leaves and grasses grow
more commonly in arid places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see big tropical leaves like
this in deserts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see very thin leaves because they're
out of water and they don't want to heat
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to blow the heat
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this becomes a really fascinating to
think about the shapes of leaves and how
[SPEAKER_01]: well they avoid getting hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they can avoid getting hot they can
avoid using water too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can blow heat away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have width and wind in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of this is coefficients to put
units.
[SPEAKER_01]: On these after we get the concepts then
you look up these coefficients in a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to do this to be equal now we have a
coefficient right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure I got following my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am 0.04 times and because of the roles
of algebra we can do width and wind right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's boundary layer thickness and
this in these units, this is boundary
[SPEAKER_01]: layers thickness in meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a small number of real
fraction of the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Width has to be have units of meters and
wind is meters per second, which are the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard units you put those in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has units to make this all cancel
to get to meters here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's this number right here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that 0.004?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a coefficient that a variable
coefficient depending on surface roughness
[SPEAKER_01]: of the object.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's some polished metal, it's a
different coefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can vary from over a factor of 2.002
to 0.008 even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how rough the surface is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine if a leaf is hairy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call that pubescent and some leaves are
really pubescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like they have fur on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those leaves this might be 0.008
because of trapping air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some furry animal, I don't know how high a
furry animal can get but danged high I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure versus a real smooth surface where it
might be lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the textbook uses this number and it's
a general number for typical leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's higher in hairy leaves and it's a
little lower in real smooth glossy leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for these purposes we use 0.004.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we get a thickness of the leaf in
meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep going and I'll come back to
some filled in examples of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still don't have, we still haven't
solved this whole thing because what we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to know up here, I'm going to erase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's leave light and sensible.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we want to get to up here is watts
per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far all we know is a thickness of
the boundary layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to put this whole thing in perspective,
erase these leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: we get c squared, could write this
anywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: delta t over boundary layer thickness in
meters, delta t in degrees Kelvin or
[SPEAKER_01]: degree C, it doesn't matter, it's the same
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have 0.026 in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thermal conductivity of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the resistance to heat flow for
air?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has units to make all the rest of
this cancel and I'll give you a handout
[SPEAKER_01]: with worked out units.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the air density was really low,
almost a vacuum, this number would get
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger and if it was more dense it would
get higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: This number varies slightly with humidity
of the air and temperature, but not very
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's close to this number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we can put numbers and solve this,
but there's one final coefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember for net radiation, we had two
sides of the leaf that that long wave can
[SPEAKER_01]: go up and it go down and that's a good
thing because it helps leaves cool off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we brand these numbers for the parking
lot outside, now we don't get to have two
[SPEAKER_01]: sides of the leaf because the parking lot
can only go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parking lot would have a big storage
component below but in the case of a leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's two sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: For conduction and convection,
two sides of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right here, I'm running out of room,
two times thermal conductivity of air
[SPEAKER_01]: times the delta t times the boundary there
and now we get watts per meter squared of
[SPEAKER_01]: heat transfer from that leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beauty of this is now we have
everything in watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watts per meter squared, watts per meter
squared, watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we can look at balancing the
energy, what the leaf is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a handout of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's adapted from the book and oh wow,
we got the, this is up here, we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same thing I wrote on the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my goal is to show it and then follow
up with the written difference for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the equation and on the bottom
of this, actually not the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a page two, this is a few examples of
what I've written on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a worked out table, leaf width or
length.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what this really is is the shortest
dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: People talk about length but a grass leaf,
it's the shortest dimension because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: generally blown sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a banana leaf, 0.5 meters,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boundary, this table is boundary layer
thickness.
[SPEAKER_01]: In millimeters, a banana leaf with really
low wind, wow, almost a centimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a banana leaf, this is almost like
having a thermal pane window around the
[SPEAKER_01]: banana leaf, a centimeter of 8.9
millimeters is pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would not stay in equilibrium with
the air very well at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would heat up and it would have to
evaporate water to balance the energy
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's so well insulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we go up this way and a real thin
leaf, 0.002, this is meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this is like a pine needle up here
and now that boundary layer is real tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: and we go this way and these are very
still air.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is meters per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: One meter per second is, down in here,
smoke would rise vertically and one meter
[SPEAKER_01]: per second is, well, cup anemometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you all know, it takes somewhere around
0.4 meters per second to start turning the
[SPEAKER_01]: cups on a cup anemometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the instrument but this is
very still air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we get up to 10 and it's really breezy
and all these numbers are small so leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to always be very close to the
air temperature when the wind is blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: because this gets tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's look at this example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one where I've put in the
numbers and worked this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assumed a delta T of 2, that's pretty
typical in the middle of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 5 centimeter width.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three fingers?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some average dicot leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhat still air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wind is blowing but not very fast so
now we plug in the numbers and there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: boundary layer thickness and here's the
rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get 116 watts per meter squared
transferred by conduction and convection
[SPEAKER_01]: in this example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to put this in perspective now,
we have this, I'm going to erase this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to erase this, this,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's try red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember from a few lectures ago we put
some typical numbers in here and this was
[SPEAKER_01]: from the handout, this is 375 watts per
meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know this, we're trying to solve
for this, 116.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty easy arithmetic now.
[SPEAKER_01]: 275, 265, what would this be, 259?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that balances the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would have to open its stomates
and evaporate 259 watts per meter squared
[SPEAKER_01]: to balance this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming there's not storage and all the
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So example of balancing this after we've
put the numbers in for conduction and
[SPEAKER_01]: convection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to show,
[SPEAKER_01]: and yes, now that we've solved this and we
know this has to be this, so let me repeat
[SPEAKER_01]: the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you then use this to calculate
stomatal resistance or stomatal
[SPEAKER_01]: conductance and the answer is absolutely
and that's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we get the driving gradient for
this and the only variable left in this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing is stomates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we, the stomates had to be this
open to be able to balance the energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we do that of course then we
make models and say in this condition the
[SPEAKER_01]: stomates were like this and then we try to
take our models and put them in and see if
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole thing balances.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the beauty of energy balance is
we calculate these three numbers and
[SPEAKER_01]: balance the energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another handout.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a two-sided handout.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is entitled, a six-step procedure to
determine energy balance components in a
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, it's all in one page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do this, this, this condensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incident is dependent on shortwave.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we often use the Greek letter
phi to mean radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always use a capital R, but it's the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phi is radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shortwave in plus shortwave in
reflected, plus longwave from the sky,
[SPEAKER_01]: plus longwave ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the four components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sky component we measure directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reflected we calculate times the,
this is one minus the albedo of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sky, I had, see how I've crossed this
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we used to calculate the sky,
but now it's becoming way more common to
[SPEAKER_01]: use an instrument and just measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Directly because we don't have to try and
model the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is an example of a new model
instrument to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several companies that build
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one more compact one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see this has four sensors,
two on the top, two on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This does all of these components of net
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sensor outputs this number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all in one, you get this number from a
single sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shortwave in, shortwave out, longwave in,
longwave out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's called a four-way radiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if these instruments are accurate,
wow, we've skipped a lot of modeling to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how even here I have calculated the
ground based on ground temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well now we could cross that out and we
could put measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have an instrument to measure
it, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, you have to calculate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we keep going down in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step two, now we do absorbed radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do emitted longwave,
again following the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step four, to permanent radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the first page we got to 375.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't have an example numbers,
it's just a summary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now flip it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step five is what we did previous lecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy transfer from transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either divided by resistance or times
conductance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I did an example here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't do an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This I put, I had to cross these out
because this is the latent heat of
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporation right at air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not incorrect, it's just a more
detailed equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me see if I've got my example of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I can find that quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me show you what this chart looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the latent heat of evaporation.
So
[SPEAKER_01]: this is 2.45 mega joules per liter,
latent heat of evaporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does this line look like as water
heats up between zero and 100 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: At zero, this is 2.25 degrees,
all the way from freezing and at 100
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, sorry, it goes the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.25 at 100 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at zero degrees C, it's, I don't have
the exact number on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's about 2.5, something like 2.55
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is latent heat of evaporation
varies very little with the initial
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies a lot with the change of state
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we connected our dots, this would be
our graph of the effect of water
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature temp on this coefficient,
latent heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because our measurements are all right
in here somewhere, for sure they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.4 something, 2.46, 2.43.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I simplified this to 2.45.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to come back to this now in just
a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we do conduction and convection and
here's the rest of the, it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: one-page summary of this whole thing with
delta T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take these principles now and I'm
going to show a couple more things on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just examples out of the
textbook that are useful examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is the length or diameter of an
object and boundary layer thickness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in millimeters, I always think I'm a
ruler and looking at the ticks on a ruler.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can conceptualize a millimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ask me to conceptualize a
micrometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are too small to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one to three millimeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now look at how this curve changes with
shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: A flat leaf is different than a sphere and
that's different than a cylinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can use the same equations to model
all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cylinders and different shapes,
different roughnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is how those shapes affect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's just wind speed examples
for tables of examples of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a good example of why width
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have laminar flow in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes turbulent at the end and the heat
transfer is better in this first section
[SPEAKER_01]: than it is down here at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just an illustration of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure in a heat transfer class you
go over all this stuff in great detail and
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff is done in wind tunnels to
calculate the heat transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put leaves in wind tunnels to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to go to this little diagram
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to blow this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a simple diagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have white underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty convinced that if you make
everything big, it gets easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why that guy,
McCully, he writes those books and he
[SPEAKER_01]: takes, how does this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he makes it big and then you can
understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure if you just can make
the diagram big enough, it's like a kid's
[SPEAKER_01]: book and you can understand commas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Complex things just by making them bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an example out of the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Net radiation in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the conditions here that we've
measured with our instruments.
[SPEAKER_01]: 370 and well coincidentally we got 375,
but they're similar numbers in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way this number in the day probably
goes from 300 to 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the conditions, but it's in
that general ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously if it's cloudy, it's a lot
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it depends on the surface it's over,
but it's in the neighborhood of 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it has to balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this example, the leaf here is five
degrees above the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is 180 and we did 116 because the
wind was blowing very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 190 for transpiration for the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put in water flux density four
millimoles and I don't know if I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: take the time to work that out,
but four millimoles of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a transpiration rate measured of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that would have to be measured to get
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Times 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is 18 grams per mole.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 40, 64 milligrams of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40, it's more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: 72.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 plus 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: 72 milligrams per meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's per meter squared per second
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now times 2.45 and this is a milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to scale this way
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a milliliter, it's a microliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have 2.45 and I'm going to do
kilojoules per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to get the microliters, let's get rid
of the kilo and this is going to become
[SPEAKER_01]: microliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the latent heat of evaporation,
conversion of units, 2.45 joules per
[SPEAKER_01]: microliter of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what measured transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what do we get here for joules?
[SPEAKER_01]: 140.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody want to do the math?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be about 190 joules per
meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, maybe exactly 190.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just did an example of taking a
transpiration rate in moles of water,
[SPEAKER_01]: converting it to weight of water,
multiplying by latent heat of evaporation
[SPEAKER_01]: to get this number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing that worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought of doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant is well watered, this can get
to 370 and this one can go to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, the leaf is at the
exact same temperature as the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the plant runs out of water,
this has to get bigger until if the
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration went to zero, this would
have to roughly double and the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature might be 10 degrees C,
that leaf to air delta T, to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: energy balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more radiation is lost if the
leaf gets hot but not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how these numbers go back
and forth constantly depending on how well
[SPEAKER_01]: watered the plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why if we put infrared sensors
on this to get leaf temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can tell the water status of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell how out of water the plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the next big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radiation frost, taking these things at
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't get that anatomically correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could fix that right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want to draw on the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be happy when the sun's out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the moon at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This net radiation goes to zero and the
sky is cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a clear night, net radiation is
always a negative number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming the ground is colder than the
very cold sky, it's always a negative
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy still has to balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now these numbers that were going out
of the leaf in the day are coming in to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the energy balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cools off below air temperature,
so it's gaining some heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything reverses itself at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: A negative number.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, C is transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why I used the symbol C,
but this is transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a negative number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So L is latent heat and C is conduction
and convection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a negative number.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's evaporating water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could go to zero if the stomates are
shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd this go negative?
[SPEAKER_01]: Condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a cold night.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air temperature was plus one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaf cooled to minus one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water condensed on it and it was below
zero, so it became frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is exactly what makes frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens here is the leaf gains heat
by change of state in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a handout right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a whole page handout.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make it easy, it's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change of state of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get this, you have it forever,
but it's counterintuitive to people when
[SPEAKER_01]: you first think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heating up water really doesn't take all
that much energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The energy is in change of state of the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The energy required, megajoules per
kilogram, to heat water from zero to a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big change of temperature,
but no change of state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, let's do the liquid to gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: After it's at 100 degrees, 2.25 megajoules
per kilogram to evaporate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes more energy to evaporate the
water than it did to heat it from zero to
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at five times as much to evaporate
the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big cooling is when the water
evaporates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, now I can fix my graph at zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a hundred degrees, it's 2.25 to
evaporate the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we go the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing happens with ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's going change of state from a
solid to a liquid back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ice, it also takes more energy to freeze
the water than it almost as much to freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: it as it did to cool it from a hundred to
zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time I do, when I saw this many
years ago and I'm thinking about it and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think about every time, now I have a
fridge automatically makes ice,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you build, you put ice in your ice
cubes and you put them in the fridge and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're waiting and waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're cold, but they're not
freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you wait and you wait and bam,
they all freeze at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because this went fast and that
final thing took forever to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: state of the ice cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, speaking of that, there's a
famous question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually done this experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make ice cubes out of hot water and
cold water and put them in your fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one freezes first?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you would expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which one freezes first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intuitively, the cold water is a lot
closer to starting, but what can happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the little trick in this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put that hot water in there and it can
evaporate like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put an inch or a couple centimeters
thick ice cube in the hot water in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of cooling, loses energy like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now your ice cube is only a quarter of
an inch thick and you only have to freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: a quarter of an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So supposedly, you can make ice with hot
water and it'll freeze faster,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you won't get much of an ice cube
because all the water evaporated.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the energy is going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal is to have big ice cubes,
so you always start with cold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's the principles back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom of this has the... This,
by the way, when it goes this way,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is called the latent heat of
condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is latent heat of evaporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get dew on leaves, it heats them up,
that goes back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we can go from this to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you one table in the book that
I'll go over just a bit quickly here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is the same diagram that I just
showed you big.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is page 332, figure 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobel works out four examples with inputs
and outputs from leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's his assumptions down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, first one, sea level,
cloudless day, 840 coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't quite a thousand,
it's not quite full sunlight, but he ends
[SPEAKER_01]: up with net radiation of 370, which he
uses up here, and he's got the components
[SPEAKER_01]: of all the things in and out on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he goes to 2,000 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, the incoming radiation is about a
bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sky is slightly colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The net radiation is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the key, leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is plus five, but at 2,000 meters,
the leaf temperature is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sky is a little bit colder and the
leaf is a little bit colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he does, and these lead to thousands
of interesting test questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: then he does a silvery leaf, where the
emissivity changes and the albedo changes
[SPEAKER_01]: because of a silvery leaf, and all of a
sudden, this is on a 2,000 meters,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 degrees, and the leaf still heats up
three above the air temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the heating is less because the leaf
is a different color, different,
[SPEAKER_01]: more silvery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the last two are really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sea level, cloudy night, so now he's got
all zeros here because it's night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature here is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example he worked out up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there is wind, the leaf still froze,
light wind, the leaf still froze,
[SPEAKER_01]: minus one, but then he works out an
example right under it with no wind or
[SPEAKER_01]: minimal wind, and the leaf went to minus
nine below the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the definition of a radiation
frost, which I put right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a surface goes below the air
temperature and below freezing,
[SPEAKER_01]: frost forms on it, and it happens all the
time on clear nights because they get
[SPEAKER_01]: below the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's condensation, and the condensation
freezes, and that's what frost is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it happens all night long, the frost
can get enormously long, but it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: because of this radiant cooling at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so profound that...
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pick this up in the second
half of this, but I'm going to introduce
[SPEAKER_01]: it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so profound that fruit growers in
the spring have to be continuously worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about radiation frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, they've just looked at air
temperature, and in one night they can
[SPEAKER_01]: lose a million dollars worth of fruit
because their young flowers get cold,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they freeze, and they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their yield is done for the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot afford to just do frost
protection based on air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to do it based on surface
temperature of the flowers, and
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in their case of the flower
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy an instrument that's a black
flat plate that simulates a leaf at night
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it out, and that flat plate gets
colder than the air, and attach a sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, and then also a single black sensor
that in a sensor give a grower a sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: the radiation frost from a direct
measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to calculating it with all the
other parameters of a weather station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruit crops in Utah are a much bigger
agricultural sector than most people
[SPEAKER_01]: realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan and Utah are the two top
producers in the nation for tart cherries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a multi-million dollar industry,
and it's all concentrated here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: northern part of Utah.
