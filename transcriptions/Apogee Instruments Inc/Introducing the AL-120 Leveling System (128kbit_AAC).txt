[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, I'm Devin Overly and I'm excited to
introduce to you the new AL120 leveling
[SPEAKER_00]: plate and mounting bracket system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This replaces our old AM110 and AL100
which were over engineered and designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with a lot of different sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AL120 is at a lower price point and is
custom designed to work with Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of other benefits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all starts with this wave spring made
out of 17-7 stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has excellent fatigue properties,
good corrosion resistance, and minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: heat distortion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another benefit is that it has captive
hardware so you don't drop the screws,
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts, or washers in the snow when you have
a polar bear snuffling up your backside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the headaches with the old system
was that you would level the sensor on the
[SPEAKER_00]: mounting bracket, tighten the screws,
the sensor goes out of level, rinse and
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the new AL120 and the wave spring,
you mount the sensor, level it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saving you valuable time because again,
polar bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new AL120 sure to be a hit with field
installers and purchasing agents alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much with the polar bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
