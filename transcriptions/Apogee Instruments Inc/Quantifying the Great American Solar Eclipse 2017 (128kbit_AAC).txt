[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'd like to show you how we
used Apogee Instruments to monitor the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation characteristics that occurred
during the solar eclipse, which happened a
[SPEAKER_00]: few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: As everybody knows, it went across the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't quite go across Apogee
Instruments headquarters here in Logan,
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of colleagues and I went to
Rexburg, Idaho, where it was right close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the very middle of totality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to show you how close the
eclipse was to the Apogee headquarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went up to Rexburg, Idaho, right here
on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan, Utah is right below Franklin
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about right here, and we just drove
up to Rexburg right near the center line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got an excellent viewing angle for
the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a camera running the whole time to
record how dark it got, and for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that were in 96, 97 percent totality,
that's not nearly the same as being in 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of totality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a video we ran with here's the
Apogee setup here, and I'm going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about these in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three laptops recording this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had our solar glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the 30-second video to give
you a sense of how dark it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a colleague, Tyler Volk from New
York University, that's written like seven
[SPEAKER_00]: books now on mega patterns, and he was
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here is when it's close to totality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's not quite as dark as a
full moon that lasted two minutes and 20
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds in Rexburg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to show you the entire two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sped it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to get light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The streetlights came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark, and now the sun comes out just
a crack, and it very quickly became light
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was in a rural area, not rural,
sorry, it's in Rexburg, Idaho,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was not near downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a lot of neighbors coming by,
all kinds of neighbors, and we took a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture with the neighborhood kids,
which were especially interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing, right after the sun started
to come back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the instruments we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used an Apogee net radiometer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used an Apogee quantum sensor here,
three spectral radiometers to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: color changes during the eclipse,
and up and down infrared sensors to do sky
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and ground temperature,
and then of course an Apogee aspirated
[SPEAKER_00]: shield for precision measurements of air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: These next several slides now show you the
changes that occurred during the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not what we might call rocket
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: NASA measures this stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that here we were measuring it
ourselves, not relying on NASA's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the picture I took of the eclipse
as it looked in Rexburg, and it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just with the standard camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eclipses are really a unique event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't occur in other planets in our
solar system, and let me see if I can show
[SPEAKER_00]: you how unique they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the sun, and in fact I want to show
you the sun in yellow to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomically correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun is 400 times bigger than the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here is the earth, and we're going to
put the earth right there on this side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon, as everybody knows, is just a
little dot right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is 400 times farther from the
earth than the moon is from the earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the sun is also 400 times bigger than
the moon, so the moon casts just enough
[SPEAKER_00]: shadow right there to give us a total
solar eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a remarkable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens in a small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened to the environmental
conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is photosynthetic radiation,
closely related to visible light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the moon in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the sensor, an Apogee full spectrum
quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morning here, we moved the table just
a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little hiccup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going up, up, up, up,
up until the eclipse starts right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as soon as the moon started to move in
front of the sun, it started to curve
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really had an hour, over an hour,
of watching the moon get closer and closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes down, we get totality right here,
and finally it starts to come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody said, let's go, we're done,
let's go, and I said, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got to wait to keep the instruments
here until this levels out to complete the
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This point right here is when it's a total
eclipse is about as dark as a night with a
[SPEAKER_00]: full moon, and the interesting part of
that is a full moon takes a long gradual
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens just very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even five minutes before totality,
it's still as bright as a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is that moment right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full moon, put that up here, full moon,
we usually consider to be 0.05 micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we didn't have the adequate resolution
to document this, but I know it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite go down to this dark and you could
see that in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brighter than it would have been on
a full moon, but still really dark as
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated by going to 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to the other radiation
characteristics?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the Apogee net radiometer,
here's the actual instrument right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that this has shortwave on one
side and longwave on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the incoming and outgoing
shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the incoming shortwave looks just like
full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outgoing also decreased because there
was less light to reflect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was over a grassy surface and grass
reflects about 20 to 25 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the ratio of these two
during the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the ratio of these two has a special
name, albedo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph shows the albedo and it's a
flat line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here we get division by zero because
the numbers were so close to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really noisy right in the middle
of the eclipse, but the eclipse did very
[SPEAKER_00]: little to the albedo, the reflectance of
the shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows how well the Apogee instrument
worked because it's very flat through all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of this does longwave
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the black top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these lines, very flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The incoming longwave right through here
is just remarkably flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall the sky temperature changed
very little during the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outgoing longwave dipped a little bit
because the surface of the ground got
[SPEAKER_00]: colder without the radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at in detail at the surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the net, which is all four
components added together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dips below zero like it does at night
so the earth is cooling because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative net radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sum of these four numbers is the
net and it's negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that negative radiation meant much
cooler surface temperatures and much
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler air temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line curves down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air temperature dropped from about
just about 20 to about 17, but look at
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened to the surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went from about 23 down to about 12
during the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the temperature of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ground temperature is measured with the
Apogee infrared sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one up and one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the up in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that the air temperature and the
ground temperature took a while to recover
[SPEAKER_00]: after this radiation came back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a while to warm back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was very noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were putting on coats in preparation
for the cold temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the ground temperature is far
more responsive to solar radiation than
[SPEAKER_00]: the air as indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: High temperature as measured with an
upward facing infrared sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, very cold, minus 50 Celsius and a
flat line because the Apogee infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor is designed to see through the
atmosphere, close to seeing the infinity
[SPEAKER_00]: of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets very cold and that temperature
changed very little during the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't expect that it would change and
it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stayed cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny bit of warming later in the day when
the temperature came back up, but minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on sky temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest change was the colors of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our spectroradiometers
measuring from 350 to 1,000 nanometers and
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring from during the eclipse to just
after the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we predicted was by blocking the
direct shortwave radiation, the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: component of radiation would increase
because of Rayleigh scattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the sky looks blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shorter wavelengths are reflected more
and increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens at different Sun angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we blocked the direct radiation and
sure enough during the eclipse we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that during the eclipse
these lines were way down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiometers picked up the blue shift
even though the intensity was many times
[SPEAKER_00]: less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of auto-integration in the
analyzers that we're able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all normalized out here so we
can look at the relative spectral changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great fun study to quantify
these changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've measured all the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it was on the screen real-time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were coming by to watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a fun documentation of the kinds of
things apogee radiometers can do during a
[SPEAKER_00]: solar eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look for you again in another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
