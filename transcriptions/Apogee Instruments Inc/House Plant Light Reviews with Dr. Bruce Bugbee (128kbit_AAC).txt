[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee and I'm here in our
recording studio today to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: low-cost LED fixtures for home
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do a lot of research on LEDs,
color of LEDs, efficiency of LEDs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we use high output LEDs that are
expensive, hundreds of dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is a rapidly emerging market of
many options of lights that are somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between $20 and $40 and they work
wonderfully for home horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: At my house I have maybe a dozen of these
lights over plants and if we cut away and
[SPEAKER_00]: went to my house you would see them,
but they're giant house plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bird's-eye fern that's six feet
tall under these lights and some peace
[SPEAKER_00]: lilies that are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fabulous for growing plants in
dark corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also fabulous for growing leafy
greens on your kitchen counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have to spend hundreds of
dollars to get very useful effective
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do in the next few
minutes is review these lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: show you examples of the ones that I have
purchased and how they work, the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages and disadvantage of all these
lights to help you make better selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start with that we're going to go to
the Amazon website which has lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to buy them from Amazon,
but there's many options and I can quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: show you the options from their site and I
could point out the pros and cons of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and we'll start with a little view
of that and then we'll look at the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just typed in LED grow light,
very generic search and all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: lights come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look we can scroll and scroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dozens and dozens of lights on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first selection criteria is cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these that are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: $254, $450, even this one's $159.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not need to pay that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're growing cannabis you need
high light, but we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing leafy greens, lettuce and basil
and spinach and all of your favorite house
[SPEAKER_00]: plants under these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need lights like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can screen down here for price
under $25, $25 to $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a useful screening feature,
but for now let's just leave this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no single brand that's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all, they're made in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're hard to tell who makes
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the first point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scroll up a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these lights are purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not buy purple lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they even exist is they're
slightly more electrically efficient and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can save 10 cents a month on your
electric bill, but they're horrible to
[SPEAKER_00]: work under.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're horrible to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the plants look black.
[SPEAKER_00]: We no longer use those at all in our
research and I don't recommend them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're the really difficult
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are finally going out of fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many more of the white LEDs than
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are full spectrum lights,
but it's not because they make the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they're much more pleasant to
have in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light quality is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these now are a warm white color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the warm white fluorescence you might
have in a bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool white means bright blue light and
sometimes that can be a little bit harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so blue in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So warm white is a really excellent color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these are warm white, but again,
here's one that's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: $80, but I said we're going to look at 20
to $40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even this one is getting up there in
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give you a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you a lot of seeming specs in
these lights, but most of them don't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's scroll down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can probably just screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that first page, even this first page
doesn't include any of the lights we've
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: $25 to $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've edited this to be the $25 to $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get rid of the purple lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Greylove SP1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a light that I have purchased
for analysis yet, but I looked at it
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good sized light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show us the size in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: $46.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of light from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be over $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overkill for some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dimmable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use high, medium, and low.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the uniformity of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, I've got to be careful to touch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's warm white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of orange and red,
not so much blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, there's a dimmable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what else comes in the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a light worth considering in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look closely at this,
these are LEDs mounted on a board,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll shoot the light sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of light up your whole living
room, whether you want it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to get lights with the LEDs
indented, and then they're much more
[SPEAKER_00]: focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a look here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to search through all these
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's skip to this light right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a YesCom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of the early lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started buying this one for research
about five or six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be about $22.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prices crept up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fine light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a thin panel, and it's one of
those lights that shoots the light out
[SPEAKER_00]: sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show you in a demonstration the
effect of a light that's focused and one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's on a flat panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got lights set up right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can wheel them in here and plug them
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost our yellow cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow cord went away, but I can plug
them in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very rigged up here just so we
can do this demo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get them flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we can get this flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see this, this light on the
left shoots the light sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do these one at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is this light right here,
shoots the light sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to unplug that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit hard to see in the studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is a cool white light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks white, not flesh colored,
because this is a cool white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light shoots sideways out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have found this light is undesirable
because of the sideways light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a little bit more money,
we get this light, which I'm going to tilt
[SPEAKER_00]: it up so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not bright because the LEDs are
inset and they're more focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives more light right below it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has less light pollution all over
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit better for your house
than this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at the light output.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this, you need a light meter,
quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These outputs are going to be similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take similar wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do this, we got to hold the sensor
similar distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not bright lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I'm getting 31 micromoles per
meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, I'm getting, oops,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get this back to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have it on the right setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I'm getting 460 below that
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, I am getting 460 below this
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're both a similar, output.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light takes only 18 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one takes 24 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by virtue of being a little more
focused, it's a little bit brighter right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big difference is side lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have found these inset lights to be
more helpful for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's wheel this away for the moment
and look at these lights on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep our meter right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this set up to look at some
other lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me skip to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, skip to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the website for that focused
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the lights are inset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowhere do they, they show the picture of
it, but they don't advertise that fixture
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a $21 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little cheaper than the
previous light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you just got to scroll and look
through these to find the lights with the
[SPEAKER_00]: features you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's no clear identifying
feature that would tell you, search just
[SPEAKER_00]: for this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to another light right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only, it's $19.95, $20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've bought a lot of these, tested them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes in a real nice box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to give it as a gift to
someone, this is a great box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to plug this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light has a switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a combination of reds and,
I'm gonna not point these right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera, of reds and whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's somewhat of a warm color.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is somewhat flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put these together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them under a shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a bit of an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note these are not inset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they give you a lot of side lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is called a, this is one that
does have a name, a sepal, LED green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these say 20 watts, that doesn't mean
that's the power they take.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some advertising thing similar to
what the equivalent of an incandescent
[SPEAKER_00]: would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, this one is about a 20
watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a light worth considering
because of the flexibility and low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at, that one, that one,
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another warm white, one in a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one that is purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a few blues in it, but it's
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I hit the reorder on this light at
Amazon, the light I ordered did not come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the exact website.
[SPEAKER_00]: A purple light came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently this manufacturer has
replaced their wonderful warm light with
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's unfortunate, but you got to be
careful to screen these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, this is one that we
haven't tested, but it's another
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in here and count the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: From their pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, the $45 roughly gets you
twice the amount of light as a $20 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are sort of overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more light than you really would
need for most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I want to say about
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy them and use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will enrich your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put them, you need them on a time
clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to buy a little, some of them
have timers and you buy a time clock and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to show you one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a light that comes in tubes and
you open the box and the light looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've mounted those tubes on a piece
of styrofoam here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I could plug this one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a fine light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got a switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's dimmable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do multiple levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a nice one because you can put
these in long linear strips.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the defining features and
defining characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see lots of lights now with
warm white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great thing or options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at what it costs to
run these lights per month on your
[SPEAKER_00]: electric bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people get concerned and rightly
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these lights are about 20 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same as a 20 watt light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have, let's get our pen up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have 20 watts times, we're gonna run
these for 16 hours HR per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a typical time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to run at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some plants don't like to have light
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 times 16 is $320.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is watt hours per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 0.32 kilowatt hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we pay for electricity,
kilowatt hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes 0.32 kilowatt hours per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's take that times 10 cents per
kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real typical price for
residential electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the math that cancels out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This equals 3.2 cents per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 30 days in a month, we're about $1 per
month to run a 20 watt light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: $12 a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I submit that unless you're really out of
money, that's some of the best $12 in a
[SPEAKER_00]: year you're gonna spend is running these
lights and growing great plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cost much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a big one, a bright one,
this might go, let's put that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different color here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red, they might get up to, no red's not a
good color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might get up, to 40 watts,
but then everything doubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a 40 watt, now you're looking
at $2 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big lights for LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking a hundred times this
easily to get bright light to grow real
[SPEAKER_00]: high light crop plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of the plants we're talking about
are high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the math and the cost per
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to walk over here and show
you our Venus flytrap research that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have going on with one of these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of research on nutrition
of Venus flytraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the research is done now,
but here's one of these lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: warm white mounted and under the counter
focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see my hand looks flesh colored
under this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants grow great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a little lid to keep them
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really healthy Venus flytrap
plants and we've had them a long time in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good example of what you
can do with lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Venus flytraps are tricky to grow,
but under this steady light, they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a lid on to keep a little bit higher
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see one of them is flowering in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an example of these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this video inspires you to buy some
of these lights for home horticulture.
See you next time.
