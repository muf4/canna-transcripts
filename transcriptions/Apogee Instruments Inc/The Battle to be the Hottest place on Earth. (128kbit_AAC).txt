[SPEAKER_00]: This is Death Valley, the hottest place on
earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a brief 90-year span from 1922 to
2013, the title of the hottest place on
[SPEAKER_00]: earth actually belonged to Azizia,
Libya, for an air temperature reading of
[SPEAKER_00]: 136 degrees Fahrenheit, but no longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does a location lose the title as
hottest place on earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by cheating, intentionally or more
likely unintentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many factors that contribute to
accurate recording of air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 681 page guide to meteorological
instrument and methods and observation
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by the WMO, pages 43 through 63
provide guidance on proper measurement of
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's extremely detailed, but it needs
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of all the variables that come
into play when recording air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a moment and see how Azizia
lost their world record.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 1919, the weather station in Azizia
was placed in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 1919, they moved the station to a
hilltop fort where it was placed on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: black tarmac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface temperatures are typically higher
than air temperatures because of solar
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rays of the sun go down and are
absorbed into the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color of that surface can dramatically
change how much heat is absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the weather station was placed
above black tarmac, the air above becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: superheated and artificially high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original thermometer had been damaged
and replaced by an uncalibrated
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer, typically used in a
greenhouse or environment not intended for
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: A classic case of using the wrong tool at
the wrong time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the usual record keeper was
replaced by an inexperienced or untrained
[SPEAKER_00]: observer who the WHO believes incorrectly
read the thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to that thermometer's particular
style, this is assumed due to the change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the handwriting shortly before the
historical measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the list of evidence and
see how the trends changed over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see why the validity of the Azizia
temperature was called into question.
[SPEAKER_00]: After reviewing the evidence, the WMO
decertified the 1922 reading and gave the
[SPEAKER_00]: title of hottest place on earth to Furnace
Creek in Death Valley, California for a
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement in July of 1913 and a
measurement of 134 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say 1913?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the Azizia decertification,
the 1913 record in Death Valley has also
[SPEAKER_00]: raised significant accuracy questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could Death Valley lose its title as
hottest place on earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially, but probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randy Cervani, a geography professor at
Arizona State University and member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: WMO stated, we accept the Death Valley
temperature extreme record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if any new material on its
surfaces, we will be prepared to open an
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this time, all available evidence
points to its legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Death Valley record were
decertified, then it's a tie for the third
[SPEAKER_00]: place with a temperature of 129.2 degrees
between Mitrobuch Kuwait in July of 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: and also Furnace Creek in Death Valley of
June 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number that's going to stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a side note, there are two recorded
measurements of 129.9 in August of 2020
[SPEAKER_00]: and July of 2021, both in Furnace Creek
that are currently pending certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you increase your measurements
accuracy and prevent fault readings?
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend using a shield that protects
the sensor from solar radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: a shield like the TS-100.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to a shield that protects the
sensor from solar radiation, the TS-100
[SPEAKER_00]: also uses a low power fan, a fan that
allows air to circulate and prevent errors
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by stagnant air sitting inside the
sensor body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also being white and reflective reduces
the shield's thermal conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of these factors, the TS-100 is an
excellent solution if you're wanting a low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, high accuracy measurement shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much like this station in Death Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: This station is set up as a collaboration
between Campbell Scientific and NWS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time you're going for a world
record or are looking to get higher
[SPEAKER_00]: quality data, consider using the TS-100,
a low power fan aspirated temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: shield from Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and have a
great day.
See you next time.
