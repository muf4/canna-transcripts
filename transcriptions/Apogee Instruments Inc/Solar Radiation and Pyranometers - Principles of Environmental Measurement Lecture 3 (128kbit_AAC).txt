[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other very key measurements is
solar radiation to any input and for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades the only instruments available
were expensive black-body pyranometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: then silicon cell pyranometers became
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have some here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we got one sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is close.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a quantum sensor,
but they're this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now silicon cell pyranometers are
almost an order of magnitude cheaper than
[SPEAKER_00]: black-body pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of us use silicon cell pyranometers
on weather stations to get solar radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: for our Penman-Monteith models and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just say, great, we've just saved a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to show you is the
differences and the errors that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: with silicon cell pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not widely appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only our work comparing them
rigorously back and forth that we've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from the fact that black-body
pyranometers, and you look at them and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a glass dome and a black disk,
record all of the wavelength, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation over this whole solar spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the entire solar spectrum on a
typical sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They measure all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all giant bands of absorption of
water vapor in the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside the atmosphere, it's a smooth
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But silicon cell pyranometers subsample
this spectra and predict the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that all the time in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We subsample things and then we predict
the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But subsampling changes, the spectra
changes with atmospheric humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll show you is the data on how
does atmospheric humidity affect this
[SPEAKER_00]: spectra and how does it affect the
accuracy of our silicon cell pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many of these I need,
but this curve and this will relate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next talk in photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things you can see from
this curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made a refrigerator magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, not everybody puts these on
refrigerators, but please, I go around and
[SPEAKER_00]: people have these on their filing cabinets
so they can see the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a magnet you could pass around
and take one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it, I have a disk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might demagnetize it or it might change
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a curve showing this in a
couple different units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens on cloudy days?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the whole spectrum as an
introduction to radiation measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And radiation was what Apogee has cut its
teeth on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're quantum sensors and we're known as
a radiation sensor company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get photosynthetically active,
which is most people in this room we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got 400 and 700 memorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the range of wavelengths that cause
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also really close to the range of
wavelengths for human vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then finally down here, UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's times when we just want to measure
this, but with pyranometers we're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all thermal radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what drives the change of state of
water from liquid to gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's blackbody and silicon cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at how this curve changes on a
cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atmospheric water vapor not only takes out
these bands, but it greatly reduces these
[SPEAKER_00]: bands of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you measure the whole thing with a
blackbody pyranometer, you accurately
[SPEAKER_00]: measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're only subsampling it,
look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This spectra is hardly changed in the
short wavelengths on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It selectively shifts the wavelengths this
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the spectral response of a
silicon cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These smaller silicon cell pyranometers
that we all use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it selectively measures this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is they over measure on
cloudy days because they're subsampling
[SPEAKER_00]: the part that's transmitted more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how bad is this effect of oversampling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how much cloudy sky there is,
but that's a big error on cloudy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at a couple of cloudy
days in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here happens to be three days when we had
full Sun, which is what these sensors are
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then partly cloudy and then
significantly cloudy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just look at this, it looks
like the curves are really pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blackbody and silicon cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you calculate the errors,
almost none here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just gets bigger here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where we're nine, 10,
even times it's greater than a 10% error.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can of course correct for this if you
know the effect and you know the fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: of clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rarely do people do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just assume the silicon cell is
correct at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a humidity effect on this
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the magnitude of the effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they accurate in full Sun
because they're calibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calibrated to full Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a same thing data ratio of
clear sky to actual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the error always goes high in these
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also probably a pretty good
example of models.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an average of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this should taper down to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just a few data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you fit this with the model,
that red line is really not very
[SPEAKER_00]: representative up here because we don't
have enough data to make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an example of how we take data
and make a model of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on severely cloudy days or
significantly cloudy days, it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: big error from silicon cell pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news about this is the cost of
blackbody pyranometers continues to come
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of these errors that we've
sold a silicon cell pyranometer for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just tell people about these
errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of this and because of the
need to make accurate solar radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements in all the days, Apogee has
now developed a blackbody pyranometer that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have these kinds of errors
because of the spectra that it measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second source of error among instruments
is called cosine error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that refers to how accurately does the
sensor measure all the angles of
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put any light sensor out there and
get some relative indication of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is really difficult to calibrate it
for light coming right straight down and
[SPEAKER_00]: have it also be accurate when the light
comes in at a low angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or same thing on a cloudy day where
there's equal radiation from all angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensor has to accurately integrate all
those angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of low angle
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we call this cosine
correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's coming in this angle,
the sensor should read 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to read a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cosine correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it really read 500 if it's at that
angle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get that correction with the
optics of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all radiation manufacturers work hard
to get cosine correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the ones selling what we call
research grade instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of pyranometers out there
that are really cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, they do a terrible job of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worry about people selling cheap
instruments and getting the cosine really
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know what you're doing,
you can test this compared to a better
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this cosine is one of the things that
people forget when some lower cost
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers sometimes forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's all the angles coming into this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph of the angle and the
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, this is a bunch of
pyranometers and the standard deviations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morning and evening are slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really close until we get out
to 75 degrees and then the errors get
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means they're not as accurate at dawn
and dusk for those measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not very much radiation out
here either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 5% error in low light is not that big
of an error in absolute terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would like these instruments to be
accurate all day long and summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about changing sun angles?
[SPEAKER_00]: We get summer angles in here and then we
get winter angles over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not cosine corrected, it can have
a big seasonal error because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: typically calibrated for summer sunlight
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we specify these often by the error out
here at 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of how companies
write specifications to how accurate are
[SPEAKER_00]: they out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just test one sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to take your entire pool of
sensors with replicates and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure your specification matches all
your instruments, not just your best
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we specify 5% at 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is two times the standard
deviation, which is 96% of the tested
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is characteristic of all instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: How stable are they long-term?
[SPEAKER_00]: And humidity companies have said everybody
can build a humidity sensor and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now check it two years later, three years
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sensors drift, but companies work hard
to minimize that drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some tests of silicon
pyranometers for long-term drift compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to high-end blackbody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Kipp & Sonnen sells very expensive
high-end blackbodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on the roof of our building in
Logan, Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple replicate high-end instruments to
get a very accurate reference point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's two glass domes
inside of these to make a primary standard
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't show the hundred pyranometers
next to these, but it's a big table of
[SPEAKER_00]: checking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some data that we're compared.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean change was only 0.1% per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the average, these are very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a very hard number to even
measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go 10 years before you even
see a 1% drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some variability in these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some that drifted as much as
1.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now oddly enough, some went up too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't always drift down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tiny changes in the optics that
affect the stability of the instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this, we write our spec at
2% a year drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the sensors should drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should drift less than that,
even though the mean is less than a tenth
[SPEAKER_00]: of a percent a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I talked about this accelerated
aging before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to really be sure you've got quality
instruments, you need to check long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the troubles with new
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets excited with new
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did the manufacturer test those
for long-term stability?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put them in an environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 10 years, you're depriving people of
that new technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can run accelerated aging tests to
try and make them fail to get better
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence that they're going to work in a
range of environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tropics and the cold places,
warm places, that's a critical thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: research grade instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another little point on these,
here's some frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we are in Sydney.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get frost here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get dew, you get condensation
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here was a morning where we had cold
morning, we had frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually this might be a radiation
frost, which we'll talk about in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two sensors right here are
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're clear because they're heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this little sensor, we can put a
tiny little resistance heater in this and
[SPEAKER_00]: warm it up just slightly to keep
condensation off the sensor and to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: dew off the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that occlusion of the optical
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's anything on that sensor,
it's going to read incorrectly and frost
[SPEAKER_00]: is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some pictures in here of snow on
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits on the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy heaters for those primary
standard pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're talking five to ten thousand
dollars for one instrument that's heated
[SPEAKER_00]: and ventilated to make an accurate
measurement versus a few hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: for a tiny sensor that has a heater in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those heaters have helped quite a bit
to help people make more accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements in places that get
condensation or in places that get snow
[SPEAKER_00]: and frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some example of snow buried under
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow here and above the snow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also on a pedestal to keep it above
so snow can't stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature affects radiation sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of comparative tests
that we've done with LICOR silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: pyranometers and ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tiny temperature effect in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most research grade sensors, this is a
small effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this goes from minus 10 to plus 40
and the effect is only 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again for precision measurements,
this is repeatable so you can measure and
[SPEAKER_00]: correct for the temperature effect on the
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how accurate you need the
solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this might be my last slide in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this I think we can talk about net
radiation next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is going to this is relates to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how we sub sampled the solar
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we often want to know turn them upside
down and know reflected radiation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and that's net shortwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a carefully calibrated silicon
cell sensor and it's turn it upside down
[SPEAKER_00]: and we say great now we know incoming and
we'll subtract outgoing and we have net
[SPEAKER_00]: shortwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be wrong because this sub
samples you turn it upside down and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected radiation is different and you
can get significant errors if you turn
[SPEAKER_00]: this upside down to do reflected
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the magnitude of the errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14% error over a grass canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see almost 20% errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should never use a silicon cell
pyranometer upside down to get reflected
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not calibrated for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to a black body pyranometer
which doesn't have this source of
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are so inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are so inexpensive everybody gets
tempted to do this and now if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: this and you're confident and you could
correct for it in software but man you get
[SPEAKER_00]: really nervous about all these fudge
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they can make measurements
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about if you use it in vertical
position?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say it upside down but if you have it
90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah if no and that's how you carefully
level these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on a leveling plate so it the
standard position is perfectly vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But would be a bigger if you use it
vertical like in a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing because you're now you're not
measuring the sky it's reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The errors would be similar to this
because of the we're sub sampling and the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectra changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing as clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent some time in this because lots of
people use these this way and you tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them not to and they still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't read the owner's manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just I like this sensor and I'm gonna
I'm gonna use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we've done a bunch of
work on to characterize these errors and
[SPEAKER_00]: try and make people aware of them through
workshops like this through videos online.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what you're doing as a
research scientist you can often get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lower-cost sensor because you know
its limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pretty often it's people that don't
know what they're doing that get tempted
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy low-cost sensors and then they
misuse them and they can have big errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it's sad because you see it all
too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of what we want to help you do is
evaluate specifications of instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to over buy expensive
instruments but if you understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: specs sometimes you can get away with less
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with less than the the
highest cost instruments if you really
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're doing and the limitations
of the sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leveling is a big source of error.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensors drift or drift they they
become unlevel or people don't check that
[SPEAKER_00]: often enough and what if the sensor starts
to tilt very slightly to the Sun or away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can quickly get big errors from
leveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spend a lot of time making really
rigorous leveling mounts and they all have
[SPEAKER_00]: a bubble level but now you got to climb in
your tower and look at that bubble level
[SPEAKER_00]: to see that it's staying level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occlusion of the sensor of the dome is a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sensors that are flat trap debris,
they trap water, they trap dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an error and of course you can
clean the sensors but how many of us do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't we just and now they read 10%
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe until you get a windstorm or not a
windstorm but rainstorm and it flushes the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensors that have a dome top help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water are self-cleaning and the water
tends to run off so those dome tops are
[SPEAKER_00]: help keep the sensor clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also helps keep it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another nemesis of all instrument
manufacturers is moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting in their sensors causing drift or
even the sensor to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold your thought a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at high-end sensors and now
unfortunately we can't quite see them in
[SPEAKER_00]: this picture because these are all shield
and aspirated to get peak accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see a little side port with
desiccant in the port.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often designed to change color so if
water vapor gets inside the sensor you
[SPEAKER_00]: change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going to this conference in
Brussels each year, a world meteorological
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kippenzonet doesn't have that little disc
with desiccant anymore on their sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: and doesn't that keep your sensor dry
internally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep this perfectly dry so you never have
condensation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said the biggest source of leaks
in our sensor was that port.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little desiccant port.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just took it out and now we have
a better ceiling and it's dry when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured and we hope it's going to
stay dry for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting change in the
development of sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They felt like taking that out helped
people make better measurements than
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving it in making them go and change
the desiccant in the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that we've worked hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pot our sensors solid so there's no,
in the pyranometers there's not airspace
[SPEAKER_00]: so it moisture can't get in and cause
problems with the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fundamental physics of the detector
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solar panels degrade over time and this is
basically a solar panel on a silicon cell
[SPEAKER_00]: that's becoming less efficient at taking
sunlight and making a voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changes in the optical path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny changes in deterioration of the
diffusing material over it that can become
[SPEAKER_00]: less transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the those are the biggest
fundamental things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In black body pyranometers it changes in
this black surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Mark just talked about emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy they work hard to make that emissivity
as close to 1.00 as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as that ages it starts to turn gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets from 1.00 to 0.99,
well there's a 1% error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fully absorbing the radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it's all sensors have just the
fundamental physics of aging of the
[SPEAKER_00]: detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And solar radiation sensors are
particularly subject to drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aging caused drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say what happens with artificial
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are calibrated for sunlight based on
that first slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you want it then lots of people
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put them under electric lights which
have a very different spectra than
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So silicon pyranometers can be way off
with I mean 50% errors under electric
[SPEAKER_00]: lights because of the change in the
spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to calibrate them and
they're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't have a mix of
sunlight and electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes they just need to be calibrated
against a black body pyranometer for that
[SPEAKER_00]: light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're fine because you know the
spectra and you can subsample and predict
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say one other thing that it's
not on the list but I'll use this sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cable leading to sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different companies use different cables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get the signal from the
sensor to the data logger and higher
[SPEAKER_00]: quality sensors have higher quality cables
coming out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that usually people write
specifications for the cable and the first
[SPEAKER_00]: dead obvious one is you want this thing to
be as waterproof as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisture starts to get in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The signal even though this is perfect
it's not getting accurately to the data
[SPEAKER_00]: logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other specification that's good to
look for in sensors is shielding for
[SPEAKER_00]: electromagnetic radiation and that's just
wrapped with tin foil and grounded at the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end so that you don't get electrical
interference and inside in greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: this can be a particular problem if
they're near fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're near equipment you get
electromagnetic noise picked up by the
[SPEAKER_00]: cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shield them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That further minimizes any antenna effect
of the sensor and so the signal gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanly and clearly back to the detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's shielded twisted pair cable is the
highest quality cable you can get to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the signal back to the detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now not in the recent past we used analog
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took an environmental change.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You measure the voltage at the data logger
and you convert it to our units that we
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensors are rapidly changing to digital
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have microprocessors in the sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the measurement is made right in the
head of the sensor and a digital signal is
[SPEAKER_00]: sent back to the data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all companies are moving to more
digital sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes the nature of the data logger
that you measure it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changes this whole thing because of a
digital signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's generally a good thing and the cost
of that technology is coming down with
[SPEAKER_00]: digital sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three big signals are SDI-12 serial
digital interface 12 is common in sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modbus is a second common one and now USB.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one happens to be a USB port.
[SPEAKER_00]: No data logger needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy the sensors and plug it into your
laptop and then you then you use the
[SPEAKER_00]: software and you can show the results on
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interface is changing fast in
sensors and the nature of the meter that
[SPEAKER_00]: you use to the sensor is changing because
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be digital sensors were quite a
bit more expensive, but now that's much
[SPEAKER_00]: less true.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general digital sensors are better
because of this signal effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to send a digital signal over
a wire than an analog signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And puts the burden of measurement right
in the sensor head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen these options
in sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just in the last few years
that more digital sensors have become
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same sensors, same optics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little microprocessor in the
head.
Thanks for watching.
