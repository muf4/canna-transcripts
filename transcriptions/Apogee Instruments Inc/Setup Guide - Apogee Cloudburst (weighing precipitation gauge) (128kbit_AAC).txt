[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quick start guide for the Apogee
Cloudburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to show you how to set
up the Cloudburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is choosing a location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you choose a location that is
free from obstructions that might prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation from coming into the gauge,
things like trees or buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This location is a great location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you've decided where to put your
gauge, you need to put it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're setting your post,
make sure that you use concrete so that
[SPEAKER_00]: during the operation of the precipitation
gauge, it won't shift or move or go out of
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cloudburst has two mounting options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either a four inch diameter pole or a six
by six inch wooden post.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to mount using a wooden
post, you can directly screw the base
[SPEAKER_00]: plate into the top of the post using lag
screws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that as you set the plate that
you level it using the bubble level on the
[SPEAKER_00]: base plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use a four inch pole,
make sure that you get the adapter The
[SPEAKER_00]: adapter will allow the base plate to fit
to a four inch pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you how you set it up
using the four inch pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the adapter screwed into the base
plate, set the base plate on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orient it so that the bubble level is
pointing north.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with it set level, use the screws to
secure it in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the base plate level and the bubble
pointing north if you're in the northern
[SPEAKER_00]: hemisphere or south if you're in the
southern hemisphere, you're now ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: add the load cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the load cell, find where the cable is
coming out of the load cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want that to align with the bubble
level pointing north if you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hole on the bottom of the plate should
align perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the load cell centered and in place,
you're ready to add the cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the cable through the access port.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw in the cord grip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And run the cable around to the load cell
connector and screw it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the cable doesn't come in
contact with the outside housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secure the cord grip so the cord doesn't
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're ready to add the cistern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place the cistern on top of the load cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should center and line up with the
indentation on the bottom of the cistern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're ready to add fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a process,
so we're going to show you how to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: When recharging your precipitation gauge,
we recommend that you do it sometime
[SPEAKER_00]: usually in September, October,
or late fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, the minimal amount of antifreeze
is required for the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend using an antifreeze that has
a ratio of 50-50 propylene glycol and
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like the Campbell Scientific
CS705.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend using this kind of antifreeze
because it's non-toxic and has a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When disposing of the antifreeze mixture,
make sure you do so in accordance to
[SPEAKER_00]: local, state, and federal guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of this equation is to
determine the minimal amount of antifreeze
[SPEAKER_00]: that is required to go in the cistern for
your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you need to determine what is the
coldest temperature that you expect your
[SPEAKER_00]: gauge to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In northern Utah, the coldest temperature
that we could expect would be minus 25
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also determine that between
September and January, when we expect our
[SPEAKER_00]: coldest temperature, we'll receive
somewhere between seven to eight inches of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go to our chart, we take our minus
25 degrees Celsius, and we see that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-part antifreeze to 1.5 parts
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: To determine how much antifreeze we need
to put inside the cistern, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: use the following equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a national weather service inlet,
it's going to be this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take 0.5289 times that
by our expected precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to divide that by the
parts per water ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take 4.2312, divide that by 1.5,
so we can see that we're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: about 2.8 inches of antifreeze in our
bucket in order to prevent freezing at the
[SPEAKER_00]: coldest point next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you can always add more
antifreeze if you need more protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just costs more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gives you the minimal amount
you'll need to avoid freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing you need to do is add 400
milliliters of mineral oil on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will give you a quarter inch layer of
mineral oil that will prevent evaporation
[SPEAKER_00]: from occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you have your cistern full of
antifreeze and mineral oil, you're ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish the install.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the cistern's full, ready to go,
it's time to remove the clips from the
[SPEAKER_00]: load cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squeeze the ends and pull them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to move or transport the
load cell, it's a good idea to hold onto
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're ready to add the outside
housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside housing will slide around the
outside over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you align the inlet with the
cistern on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the clips to secure it in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hook up the cable to a data logger and
you're ready for another year's worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend servicing your gauge in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: By servicing the gauge in the fall,
you minimize the amount of antifreeze that
[SPEAKER_00]: is required to prevent freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To service the cloudburst, remove the
outside housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the housing removed, look around and
make sure that everything is in working
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cistern is probably going to be quite
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two handles on the side of the
cistern to help you lift it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another great option is to use a
siphon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the siphon in the cistern and with a
few squeezes, it will begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill up the cistern with fluid,
antifreeze, and then the mineral oil on
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cistern is full, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the outside housing back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the outside housing back on,
you're ready for another year's worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation monitoring.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and have a
great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
