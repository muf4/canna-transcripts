[SPEAKER_00]: At Apogee, we sell a lot of power meters,
and finding the right one can feel a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick around and we'll help you find the
perfect power meter for your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick refresher for those who might not
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantum meters measure light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it simple, imagine that the light
coming from the sun is like rain falling
[SPEAKER_00]: from the clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our meters are like uncovering a sheet of
paper out in the rain for one second and
[SPEAKER_00]: then counting the number of drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Counting drops is essentially what a
quantum meter does, but instead of rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: they count photons of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A PAR meter measures the amount of light,
but only in the light spectrum that
[SPEAKER_00]: promotes photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light in this range is called
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This PAR wavelength spectrum is between
400 and 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing this PAR information can be vital
in growing and studying plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to how we use calories when
studying the growth of humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using other measurements like lux or foot
candles falls short because lux and foot
[SPEAKER_00]: candles determine the amount of light that
the human eye can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the human eye sees some color of
lights better than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human eye is more sensitive to colors
like green than we are to red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because our eyes use a rod and
cone vision system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike humans, plants see all the colors
in that spectrum evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you graph the photosynthetic
response of plants to light, it would look
[SPEAKER_00]: something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wanted to measure light,
according to a plant's sensitivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: a perfect meter would produce a response
curve that would look identical to that
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that understanding, you have the
knowledge that you need to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in the sensors that we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Apogee, we produce three versions of
quantum or specifically PAR sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is the original X, then the full
spectrum, and last the EPAR sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original X is the least expensive
sensor we make and it features a response
[SPEAKER_00]: curve that looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this response curve is not
ideal in that it overestimates the blues
[SPEAKER_00]: and the greens while underestimating the
reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also captures a significant amount of
UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first glance, it might not seem like a
close match to this PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the over and the underestimations
being accounted for, it's not bad in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Apogee Instruments, we take pride in
being a low cost, high science provider of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high science part refers to the fact
that although the inexpensive sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be the most accurate,
we know exactly where and why they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with those shortcomings, we can use
calculations to correct the data and make
[SPEAKER_00]: that sensor sufficiently accurate for a
much lower price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the sensor tends to overestimate
the blues and the greens while
[SPEAKER_00]: underestimating the reds, it does not work
so well for LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does have two broad spectrum
calibration options.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those options is for sunlight and
the other is for electric lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a T5 or a high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great lower cost option if
you're specifically measuring either
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight or these electric lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next sensor is the full spectrum
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the response curve of the full
spectrum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the response curve on the
full spectrum much more closely follows
[SPEAKER_00]: the PAR curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also catches a little bit of UV and
kind of under responds a little bit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sensor that can obtain a perfect PAR
response is impossible to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can spend significantly more
amount of effort and time, which equals
[SPEAKER_00]: money, chasing marginal accuracy returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor is an excellent balance
between accuracy and cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another benefit of this level of response
curve is that the sensor is accurate under
[SPEAKER_00]: all lighting conditions, from sunlight to
LEDs to high pressure sodiums or T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the accuracy of this sensor does
come at a higher price than the original
[SPEAKER_00]: X.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, one more type of sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In recent years, there has been increasing
evidence that far red light found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 to 750 range of the light spectrum can
contribute to plant growth, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant leaf size and general plant
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This extended range has been given the
term EPAR or extended PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a full spectrum sensor that
includes this additional portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the response curve looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we've gone over the quantum
sensors that we have available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you what formats we have these
sensors in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the handheld.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have sensor only options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the handheld meters first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The handheld meters are perfect for spot
checking and automatic logging of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete solution that requires no
additional hardware or other components to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The handheld meter allows for a sensor
that can be submerged, not the meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the head can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have several underwater models that
have correction factors applied for taking
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in an aquarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all handheld quantum meters,
you have the ability to access the DLI
[SPEAKER_00]: data using the optional AC100
communication cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the Apogee Connect software,
you can access all the saved data in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to the DLI measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next meter format we have is the DLI
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a handheld meter is like counting drops
on a piece of paper, DLI is like a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than measuring light at a specific
moment, the DLI is collecting data through
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In math, an integral is a term referring
to the area under a curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the daily light integral is the amount
of light during a 24-hour period and is
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in a term called moles per meter
squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the DLI reading,
the DLI meter gives you instant PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: readings and the previous day's photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period is the amount of time the
light was on in the last 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the DLI is connected to a computer
with the included USB-C cable,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can access the data set with 99 days
of DLI and photo period data as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the last seven days of PAR data with
averages over 30-minute intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: In summary, the DLI meter is perfect for
collecting DLI measurements, photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, and doing spot checks of
PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect for outdoor use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensor is resistant to falling rain,
but you don't want to submerge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last sensor format we have is the
sensor only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ideal for situations where you
already have a system or a method of
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of options to match
whatever protocol your system uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on our sensors, we have various
outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have analog and we have digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our analog options, we have a zero to
40 millivolt option, which is our
[SPEAKER_00]: unamplified option, and it's capable of
connecting with an Apigee microcache.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apigee microcache enables app
connectivity with Bluetooth connections
[SPEAKER_00]: from your phone using the app that's
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the app, you can view data and adjust
logging intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a zero to 2.5 volt,
a zero to five volt, and a four to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: milliamp option available as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our digital outputs, we have an SDI-12
output, a Modbus output, and a USB
[SPEAKER_00]: connection output.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USB option allows you to connect the
sensor to a desktop computer using the
[SPEAKER_00]: Apigee Connect app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can view and collect the data and
adjust your logging parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensor then can be disconnected from
the computer and then powered by a USB
[SPEAKER_00]: charger where it can then collect data on
its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for the least expensive
option, this is your best choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does require a computer and takes a
bit more time, and it's not quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the various sensor output options,
we have several cable lengths,
[SPEAKER_00]: including no cable, 30 centimeter and two
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can even do custom lengths upon
request.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to our standard range of
sensors, we have several specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors, like the light pollution sensor,
which has a higher sensitivity to a wider
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum range, but will overrange around
200 micromoles per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an array sensor that will
take an average reading of multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with the various types of sensors,
we have lots of mounts, leveling plates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other accessories for all of our
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully now, you should have a better
understanding of what types of PAR sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: we offer.
