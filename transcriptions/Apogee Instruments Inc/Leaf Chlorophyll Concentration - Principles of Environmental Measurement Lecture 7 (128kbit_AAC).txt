[SPEAKER_01]: The next topic, I'm going to do two at
once so they're real short, leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have a chlorophyll meter here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the instrument, self-contained
digital readout.
[SPEAKER_01]: You clamp on a leaf and this tells you the
amount of chlorophyll in the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is particularly useful for assessing
plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of self-contained,
pretty easy to use, it's a useful
[SPEAKER_01]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't going to read much right now
because that's, I don't know, I can pass
[SPEAKER_01]: it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't get to read much right now
because we don't have a leaf here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how does this work to measure
chlorophyll?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's install the power buttons.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hold the leaf up and look at it,
you can tell how green it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a thicker leaf and darker
green, it's got more chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just by looking at it, you get a sense
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you shine a beam of red light through
the leaf and if most of that's absorbed,
[SPEAKER_01]: that indicates high chlorophyll in the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that was the case, we would be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just shine light through it and red is
a wavelength highly absorbed by
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could relate the transmission of red
light to the amount of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cell walls and all the cellulose in a
leaf also absorb light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a leaf with not too much chlorophyll
but thick and a lot of cell wall material
[SPEAKER_01]: would not transmit light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we shine two beams of light through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One at 930 nanometers, a wavelength that
chlorophyll doesn't absorb bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by ratioing the wavelengths,
we can separate out the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll from all the other material in
the leaf, the structural material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shines through and hits a detector
and then the leaf gives us a reading of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ratio of those two wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fairly old technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: These meters are sold by a couple of
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it only gives you a relative index of
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do this, this would be great if we
walked outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this doesn't need sunlight,
it's got its own lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had a leaf, you could measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can play around with it at the break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can measure some of those leaves out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only gives you an index of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the reading says 10 and another leaf
says five, you conclude that one has
[SPEAKER_01]: doubled the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incorrect because it's an index and
it's nonlinearly related to chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the, here's the wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the classic transmission and
reflectance signature of any plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little hump right here in the green,
a dip in the red and up where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: pigments are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now over here and that's just transmission
of the non-pigmented wavelengths,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time we do reflectance, we're
looking for subtle changes in the slopes
[SPEAKER_01]: of these lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this just measures 991, 653 and the
ratio of these is called the chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration index.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, not in this meter yet,
but this is 7.5 and the bigger the number
[SPEAKER_01]: the more chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we look at the index for
chlorophyll measured by this meter and the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a sample of the leaf,
extract the chlorophyll, measure it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrophotometer in the lab with the
cellulose gone and these are curved lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always curved for all species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's 7.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a difference of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is spad units.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you heard of it, maybe you haven't ever
heard of a spad meter down here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's another chlorophyll meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the index, but the apparent
difference is four and the real difference
[SPEAKER_01]: is only three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are reproducible differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we programmed that meter in software
with equations for multiple species to
[SPEAKER_01]: linearize this line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that meter reads out in moles of
chlorophyll per meter squared of leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real chlorophyll on leaf, not an index
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a recently released product to do
chlorophyll and that's how it works with
[SPEAKER_01]: equations in software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what my next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the species that are
programmed in and not surprisingly lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: economic agricultural species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a generic index for species
that haven't been precisely characterized
[SPEAKER_01]: yet, but the difference is reading out in
a physiological unit amount of chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: per meter squared rather than just some
index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for physiological studies, we're really
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interpretation of the data is interesting
because high chlorophyll doesn't always
[SPEAKER_01]: mean high plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: In low-light plants can make a lot of
chlorophyll to have dark green leaves to
[SPEAKER_01]: capture every photon they can,
but its single biggest use in agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: is to look at nitrogen status of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When plants start to get incipient
nitrogen stress, chlorophyll is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first things to go and the leaves start to
get slightly less dark green and this
[SPEAKER_01]: meter can detect those and tell people
it's time to fertilize your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our eyes are so keenly attuned to color
that our eyes are great at monitors of
[SPEAKER_01]: color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any one of us could walk outside and say,
these plants are a little bit more green
[SPEAKER_01]: than these, just barely, but I can see it
and we would all agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we pick two leaves and we said this
one is greener than this, why would we
[SPEAKER_01]: need a meter if we can see the difference
in color?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now put them behind your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put them behind your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now which leaf is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me the other one to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no memory for color.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have an exquisite ability to
compare it and especially day after day
[SPEAKER_01]: you're measuring this and you see the
chlorophyll getting slightly downhill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the value of a chlorophyll meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does it digitize it so anybody
anywhere could use the number,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also has memory for tracking it
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might go back to this slide,
[SPEAKER_01]: this one here, even this picture without
all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is related to remote sensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even though this is the
transmission of light going through a
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf, when you think of the optics of what
happens to light hitting a leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we draw it here, here's the cross
section of a leaf with a bunch of cells in
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some light coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wavelengths, and I might draw this
this way, the wavelengths that are
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted are the same ones that are
reflected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflectance and transmission of lights are
basically the same process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that photon bounces off a surface,
some bounces up and some bounces down,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the signature for reflected light is
the same for reflectance as it is for
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like mirror images of each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use a spectroradiometer and put it
on top, you get this exact same shape of a
[SPEAKER_01]: curve for reflected light.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just works a little bit better by
doing transmitted light, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: principle is helpful in remote sensing too
for measuring reflectance and
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I want to say about
leaf chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a simple process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess because it's simple, you don't
have a big learning curve to learn to use
[SPEAKER_01]: the meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, fertilizer companies sometimes
have sold this meter to growers to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them tell when to fertilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have any of you used this meter here in
crop production?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fairly widely used commercially
and mostly for fertilization scheduling of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, turf almost always is doing
reflectance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty hard to do transmission and
turf leaves are real tiny, but it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: same concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's changing color, it can change
color because of moisture stress too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, but it's mostly because the
instrument can remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tiny bit less green than it was
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we had no memory for color.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just couldn't read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
