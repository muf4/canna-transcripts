[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of FAPG
Instruments and I'm going to today walk
[SPEAKER_00]: you through the research we did over
several years to develop this new
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this idea quite some time ago but
it took a lot of R&D to get this and the
[SPEAKER_00]: work we did is published and publicly
available in this paper here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a copy of it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really pleased that Plant Cell and
Environment published this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of our top journals because
there's a lot of detailed physiology in
[SPEAKER_00]: this paper and there's so much detailed
physiology that I want to walk you through
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it in the next few minutes with
referencing the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the meter on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an optical meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clamp it down based on the
transmission of two wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It converts this in software to a unit of
chlorophyll per unit area and in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: it's moles of chlorophyll per meter
squared of leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other meter, optical meter,
in this price range can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the unique breakthrough of this
meter but it was not trivial to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's walk through some of the graphs
in this and let's look at what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we did is a massive
literature review and we found that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are over 30 studies on this relationship
between transmission of light and
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started back in 1986.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a meter called the SPAD Minolta
501 and they later in 1990 they came out
[SPEAKER_00]: the Minolta 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are old meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are starting to establish this
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a critical paper right here,
Monge and Bugby, 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my graduate students Oscar
Monge and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper turns out to be one of my top
five most highly cited papers in this list
[SPEAKER_00]: because we discussed the inherent
limitations of doing this back in 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about 10 years later the papers start
to show up with an OptiSciences meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CCM 200 and giving this what we call
the optical absolute relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the relationship between
what this meter can read and the true
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of chlorophyll in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this relationship is nonlinear
which is one of the big problems but the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing we looked at was alright,
how do these studies agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on all different species so let's
take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's curves for the Minolta meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit, by the way, people act like
this is a measurement of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: SPAD stands for Special Products Analysis
Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the name of the division in
Minolta that developed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a unit of chlorophyll
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a name of a group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's nonlinear and going up
but look at the scatter in studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: many studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green line right here is the one we
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we did this again using more
modern techniques, 25, 20 some years
[SPEAKER_00]: later, modern spectrophotometer,
more rigorous extraction techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got this black line which is close to
the average of all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some people have studied the
OptiSciences meter and chlorophyll and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's also nonlinear, curves the other
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did both of these in this paper,
in this relationship but so far this is
[SPEAKER_00]: literature review except for our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it does is show these papers don't
agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well why don't they agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well part of it is because they're
different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different species have chlorophyll
arranged in different packs in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways so the light transmits differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really need a line for each species
but look at this, several papers studied
[SPEAKER_00]: the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat, they got different curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: For wheat, one of these is our paper,
we went back and looked at these studies
[SPEAKER_00]: and not one of them used the exact right
combination of techniques to accurately
[SPEAKER_00]: convert an optical measurement to an
absolute measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is always the absolute measurement
here, chlorophyll which is always what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit down here is what the meter
gives us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get several things right to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have just the right solvent
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have the right equation and
you have to have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrophotometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of those things have to match
and when we looked at the literature it
[SPEAKER_00]: was very rare for these older papers to do
everything correct to get the exact right
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll including our own paper from
1992 we realized we didn't use the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: right techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did it again this study means
this plant cell and environment paper
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, we got this curve and
fortunately the reviewers agreed yes these
[SPEAKER_00]: are all the right techniques that's the
gold standard curve that replaces all
[SPEAKER_00]: these previous curves which were similar
but not exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make a point here about the problem
with older meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you clamp on a leaf and you get a
reading of 20 you're on this point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: curve and you have about a hundred units
of chlorophyll, micromoles of chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you do another leaf and you get a
reading of 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: You conclude ah the chlorophyll has
doubled because the number is twice as
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go up here and across.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll went up four fold between
a hundred and four hundred and our meter
[SPEAKER_00]: only doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of bad data in the
literature where people are over reliant
[SPEAKER_00]: on these spad units and when they should
be reliant on the actual chlorophyll and
[SPEAKER_00]: things and that's a pretty dramatic
example of the problem and the
[SPEAKER_00]: misinterpretation of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal in all of this was to develop
a meter where we could convert in the
[SPEAKER_00]: software of the meter to actual
chlorophyll units in the meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a relative index of chlorophyll but
actual chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a video shot in the laboratory of
making an optical measurement with the
[SPEAKER_00]: meter and then very carefully marking
where that measurement was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now underneath this is the reading of the
amount of chlorophyll to write down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in order to get the gold standard you
have to take that disk out from the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same spot on the leaf that the measurement
was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done with a cork borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it into a little vial of dimethyl
sulfoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different extraction solvents but
this is the one of choice and mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look in here you can see this tiny
little leaf disk floating in this
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll doesn't come out right
away and to speed it up we put it at 65
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's walking over to a drying oven
putting it in the drying oven with that
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction solvent and now we wait and it
typically takes about three hours until
[SPEAKER_00]: all the chlorophyll is gone from the leaf
in solution still 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the vial three hours later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the disk is white and all the
chlorophylls in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one is extract the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one measurement on one leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next step is to bring it into the
laboratory and measure it, transfer it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a cuvette, measure it in our
spectrophotometer which scans the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate wavelengths and then reads
them out on a computer and will zoom in
[SPEAKER_00]: here for you in just a minute on these
values which show the absorbance of those
[SPEAKER_00]: two wavelengths with those two numbers in
the correct equation now that matches the
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument and the dimethyl sulfoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can calculate both chlorophyll A and B
and we add the two values together and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as your laboratory procedures
are correct this is how you get the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: standard of chlorophyll but it's obviously
a lot of work compared to getting a single
[SPEAKER_00]: digital number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our concerns was that you can't
ever have a single curve across a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range of environments to do this because
the arrangement of chlorophyll molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: will change with environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested that in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew plants in many different
environments and our data pretty clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate environment has a minimal effect
on the arrangement of chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the tests of that was to compare
our data for paper birch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a widely distributed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was studied by Richardson who has
that at Yale in 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did everything right in his
extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also measured paper birch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a continent away, 30 years later,
same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a correction in the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we plotted this against Richardson's
data we get virtually the same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helped convince us that this
procedure is robust across time and space
[SPEAKER_00]: and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get a curve for a species that is
the curve for that species and that
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed us to take the curves we developed
and put them into the software of this
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do those curves look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the index from the meter and the
chlorophyll here and you can see all these
[SPEAKER_00]: nonlinear curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat, rice, and barley are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are just graphed on the same
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepper and soybean have a remarkably high
amount of chlorophyll in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scale change was double of these other
curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graphical representation of the
curves for all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a summary of the species and the
numerical equation to linearize the data
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the R-squared values for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pretty hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can study the paper and get them
exactly but these are mostly in the .9s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a .97.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's high correlation coefficients of
determination for the fit with these
[SPEAKER_00]: species which allows us to convert an
optical reading to the absolute reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all published in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's all the curves for all the species
with the index and then for species that
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't yet have a curve for,
here's a generic curve and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation to convert the reading to
absolute chlorophyll content over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of species, lots of lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few species have very dark,
very high amounts of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the species are down in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way, we were able to develop two
very accurate curves for converting among
[SPEAKER_00]: optical units from different meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: These special products analysis division
units can now be converted to chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: content index, which is what OptiSciences
uses, and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know the CCI, you can convert that
to SPAD units.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these equations, which are
pre-programmed into this apogee meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can have this meter read out in any
of the units of the previous meters in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to the true chlorophyll units.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very high correlations,
.98 and .99 for these conversion
[SPEAKER_00]: equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think you could do this
mathematically but Minolta has a
[SPEAKER_00]: confidential equation in their meter and
it's not known what the coefficients are,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have to do it empirically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like logarithms in high school and
manipulating logarithms, you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in this little section of this
paper, which is a series of five equations
[SPEAKER_00]: that takes us through the percent
transmission all the way down to
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mathematical relationships
that are going on because there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths coming through the leaf and we
ratio these wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason this needs logarithms is the
transmission of light is nonlinear.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you double the pigment, you do not
cut the transmission in half and you
[SPEAKER_00]: change the absorbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through the details
right now but this is a ratio of two
[SPEAKER_00]: transmissions, e raised to a power.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two wavelengths, so this is
critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This NIR wavelength, which is at about 930
nanometers, measures cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to write it out because it's
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures just the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This red wavelength, which is at 653
nanometers, measures both chlorophyll and
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no single wavelength that only
gives us chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to ratio two wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see how by subtraction we can
get to chlorophyll but we have to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with this nonlinear effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have e raised to these powers,
this ranges to chlorophyll plus cell wall
[SPEAKER_00]: minus cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the log of both sides, solve that for
the logarithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get chlorophyll plus cell wall minus
cell wall equals chlorophyll and
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematically this is what these meters
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: SPAD should theoretically equal
chlorophyll and the log of the CCI should
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is all done in software in the
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a fun math exercise if you like
following the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us a while to work through this in
the lab to get this, but it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfying once we showed it theoretically
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the species in the apogee meter
for which we have equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on additional equations for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's generic equations in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major annual crop species are in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of deciduous species also
in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a summary of what we had to do to
get to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make this meter read out in moles,
this doesn't say anything right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is moles of chlorophyll per meter
squared, which is what you get with a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrophotometer and it's now what you
get with this non-destructive optical
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: For details, I refer you to our paper in
Plant Cell and Environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Apogee for a copy of the paper and
it's also available on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to another visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
