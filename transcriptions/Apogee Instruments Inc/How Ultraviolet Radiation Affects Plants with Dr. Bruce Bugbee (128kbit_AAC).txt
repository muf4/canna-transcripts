[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, President of Apogee
Instruments and Professor of Crop
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this short video, we're going to talk
just about UV photons and what they do to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee makes a couple different sensors
for UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a SU-200, which is just for UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the extended range now start to
measure UV, and most importantly for UV,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more expensive, but if you're
really doing UV research, you really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy the more expensive instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at this because it's
very confusing to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what we call the electromagnetic
spectrum, and the two key points are 400
[SPEAKER_00]: and 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is visible light and it's well
discussed in previous videos, so we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just draw a box for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as everybody knows, these colors have
different effects on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all equal, but for
photosynthesis they're close to equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, right at 400, we call this UV
light, but the wavelengths of UV are very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we give letters to them, and let's put
UV in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go to 320, now some people say
this is 315 nanometers, but the transition
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, this is called UVA,
and it's just A, the letter A,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's close to the visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This radiation is LEDs can produce this UV
radiation pretty effectively, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: much less powerful to a plant than the
next group of wavelengths, and now I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show these in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a band right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is B, UVB radiation, and then finally
we get a band down here, which is UVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is pretty much review for people
that study UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is fairly benign, B is a lot more
powerful, and C is really powerful,
[SPEAKER_00]: very damaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of these wavelengths are in
sunlight, and how do those photons cause
[SPEAKER_00]: sunburn, because we know that sunburn in
people is caused by these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at sunlight first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put that in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight starts, this wavelength right
here, by the way, is 280.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below 280, we get all of the radiation
from the Sun is filtered by our
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunlight starts here, and if we're
going to make a curve for sunlight,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's vanishingly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get this in yellow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vanishingly small, and then right
about 380 starts to go up, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a big jump right at 400,
and it curves, starts to look like that
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little tiny curve, a graph like
this looks like there's hardly anything
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but these photons are hundreds and
thousands of times more powerful than
[SPEAKER_00]: these photons, so the trace of radiation
here is a very big deal for light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it starts to jump up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about sunburn?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have weighting factors for sunburn,
and let's put those in white.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weighting factors for sunburn start
very high here, and they look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the erythema response curve
and a huge weighting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One photon in UVB is equal to a hundred of
UVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tremendously powerful for causing
sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass in greenhouses filters out
pretty much all of the UVB, so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: worked all day inside a glass greenhouse,
the glass is kind of like SPF 60 in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sunscreen effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get a sunburn inside a
greenhouse, but you'd have to be working a
[SPEAKER_00]: long, long time to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these photons are not at all the same,
big weighting factors, and you can see why
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to know, are you on this curve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you right here on the curve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you right there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you right there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Enormously different.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this look for plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the erythema response curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we graph this for plants,
the curves look really similar to sunburn
[SPEAKER_00]: curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a series of plant growth curves,
depending on what we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are DNA damage, but they all come
down something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact shape is important, but they all
exponentially decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV is so damaging down here, we want to
use it very sparingly, but up here it can
[SPEAKER_00]: have some beneficial effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help make plants tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants make their own sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you give them some UV, they synthesize
pigments in the leaves, and they protect
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves against UV photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a beneficial effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these photons in here that are close
to the visible light can be beneficial to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and we can use them in various
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help keep plants short, help make the
cuticles thicker, make the layers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing happens here, but when we
get into these, we need to have extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: small doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done research on UVC in our
laboratory, and oh my, you only turn that
[SPEAKER_00]: on for seconds per day, and you hope you
don't burn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The B, we've also studied, and we've
burned our share of plants with UVB by
[SPEAKER_00]: turning them on one hour, two hours,
three hours a day, and then you start to
[SPEAKER_00]: see burned parts of leaves because the
plants couldn't adapt to that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is far less powerful, and we can give
them a lot more UVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of these are potentially
beneficial depending on the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule of thumb is some UV is good for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the right amount, and some UV is
good for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got so concerned worldwide about skin
cancer and sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have everyone's using sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The incidence of vitamin D went up in the
population because people were blocking
[SPEAKER_00]: all the UV, and we need UV photons to
synthesize vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a powerful example of some UV is
beneficial for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to one other screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get to another screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take another screen, and just to get
a clean screen, here's 400, here's 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee makes the meter quantum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, this is not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting the wrong model number on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a visible meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensor UV 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a UV sensor, and its response
curve looks something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets mostly UVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get any visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cuts off in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a useful sensor, but it's you got
to couple it with what types of UV that it
[SPEAKER_00]: measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to separately get UVB,
UVC, UVA, and all the weighting factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you need a spectroradiometer,
which is a powerful tool in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor is good, but it doesn't tell
you the exact wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the other EPAR sensors now get
some of this in here, because this is
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial radiation right below 400 that
causes photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this helps as a summary of UV light
in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to know the wavelengths to
be able to tell whether we can have big
[SPEAKER_00]: doses of a fairly safe wavelength or tiny
doses of a really powerful wavelength,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have electric lights to give all of
these different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actively studying these now in my
laboratory at the university, these
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you our early research is
tricky to get the doses just right,
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are damaging wavelengths,
but the goal is to use them to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: product quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things plants do when they get
UV photons is make what we call secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary metabolites includes
cannabinoids, it includes terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it includes vitamins, a lot of beneficial
things for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can get the doses of UV just
right, we have a potential to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: product quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you again in another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
