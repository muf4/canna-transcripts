[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Ben Crabb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do technical sales and support here at
Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to talk about our new MicroCache
Bluetooth Logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little Bluetooth enabled battery
powered device that connects with your
[SPEAKER_00]: smartphone and interfaces with any of our
unamplified analog sensors, any of our
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors that put out a little millivolt
signal this MicroCache can log.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll just briefly go over some of
the features and specs of the MicroCache
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll show off with the phone,
how to connect it and some of its
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a picture of it and an idea of
the dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a little 4 to 20 threaded hole in
the back for mounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can mount it to any of our mounting
brackets.
[SPEAKER_00]: By default, most of our sensors come with
this little cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 12 inches long, one foot long,
30 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that makes a nice compact unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have for our power sensors,
we've got a two meter cable length option
[SPEAKER_00]: for measurement under water or for corals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This MicroCache connects with your phone
with a little smartphone app called Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it on the Apple App Store or
the Google Play Store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is an overview of the specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll point out a couple of the major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IP rating is IP67.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that it is rugged for outdoor
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple on the roof of the
Apogee building and they've been snowed
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the end of January now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been up there for months and
they're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weight is only 52 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be great for mounting on a
drone if you wanted to fly it around and
[SPEAKER_00]: take aerial measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data storage capacity is almost half a
million data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the battery life ought to be long.
[SPEAKER_00]: One or two years based on this 10 second
sampling interval or 60 second sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: interval with an average of five minutes
of daily connected time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That battery life will be dependent on the
amount of time that you're connected with
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bluetooth communication requires more
power than just the logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing on this that I'll point out
is the ADC, the analog to digital
[SPEAKER_00]: converter resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 24 bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's two rays of the 24th power,
number of intervals across the two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half volt measurement range, which is
negative one and a quarter volt to one and
[SPEAKER_00]: a quarter volt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's very fine resolution
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can distinguish very fine changes in
the voltage value from the sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, one more thing I'll point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A two thirds double A is what it runs on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little unusual battery size,
but you can find it online in battery
[SPEAKER_00]: stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just looks like a double A battery,
but it's a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a great solution for spot
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about in particular the PAR
application now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spot measurements, logging PPFD values.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is photosynthetic photon flux
density, that value that's expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: units of micromoles per meter squared per
second of light within the 400 to 700
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometer wavelength for plants and
calculating DLI and photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI is the daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the summation of all those
PPFD values over the course of a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the photo period is how many hours
over the last 24 has the light been above
[SPEAKER_00]: a threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can set a custom threshold in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By default, it chooses half a micromole,
which is quite dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these two graphics just show the
concept of DLI across the country per
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just from sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, if you're growing indoors,
electric lights will also contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: your DLI situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right, this is a document that
you can link to on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came through Purdue University's
extension office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it highlights the DLI values for a
whole lot of different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our device, with this microcache
logger, you can precisely measure your
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels for the optimum level for
your plants and the optimum photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, here's an overview of the screens in
the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just briefly, the overview screen gives
you a look at all the microcaches you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been connected to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can be connected to as many
microcaches as you have with the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this screenshot, just one of them is
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's got a value of 18.4
micromoles per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones aren't connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they were, you'd also see live
readings from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logging setup screen, you get to this
by clicking on the little gear icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow you to set up your logging
and sampling intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fastest sampling you can do is one
second sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that'll drain your battery a
little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it looks like we have it set
to 10 second sampling and one minute
[SPEAKER_00]: logging in this screenshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minute logging is still quite fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could log every 10 minutes or every 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still get a real good idea of your
light levels through the course of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, this live meter display.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to live meter mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this graph will update every
second with new values as you can walk
[SPEAKER_00]: around and put it under this light,
under that light, and be able to see
[SPEAKER_00]: precisely the light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this mode, you can also do a manual
data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a button a little lower on this
screenshot where you can push the button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll timestamp, give a date and time,
and your micromole value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will be there the next time you
open the app as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over here on the far right side of
the screen, this is after you've
[SPEAKER_00]: downloaded log data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a look at what's been going
on over the course of the previous days or
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks that you haven't been attending to
your sensor perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, I've pulled a fast one a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph is not just from an SQ500,
which is what this blue-headed sensor is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this one's from a new sensor that we
have, the PAR-FAR sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has two diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One measures the PAR range, and the other
diode measures far red light, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: also important for plant photosynthesis
and morphology or shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on this graph, you can see there's
the green curves each day that is the PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the far red light is expressed
with the red line, and those are smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: values.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you can get both values from
this new PAR-FAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the far right screen grab, you see the
daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the value I was talking
about previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the summation of all those
PPFD values over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in moles per meter squared
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also see your photo
period, which is the number of hours over
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever dark threshold you've set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the kind of summaries you
can get from collecting the log data off
[SPEAKER_00]: of your PAR sensor with the MicroCache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or from your PAR-FAR sensor with your
MicroCache.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mentioned this before,
but we do have two cable lengths,
[SPEAKER_00]: the approximately one foot or 30
centimeter length, which is the default
[SPEAKER_00]: length for all of our sensors before it
gets to that little connector.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for coral enthusiasts or underwater
users, we do have a two meter cable length
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can order, and that just gives
you a little bit more leeway to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor down in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go dunking the MicroCache in
water, but it'd probably be fine for a
[SPEAKER_00]: brief dunk, but I wouldn't put it under
for long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this just shows how it connects
to our brackets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that quarter-twenty threaded hole
in the back, and so it's pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: mount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some grooves on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use zip ties to connect it to
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then our web page, our product web
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to our website,
ApogeeInstruments.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You click on products up here,
and you'll be able to quickly see
[SPEAKER_00]: MicroCache Bluetooth Logger, and you get
to this web page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more information and things
you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the URL for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the end of the slides that
I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I'll switch over to HDMI 2 and
get this phone connected so we can show
[SPEAKER_00]: off the sensor or the functionality of the
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, screen mirroring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Connect is this app with the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's green colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Apogee Connect general screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this phone, there's been a lot of
sensors that have been connected in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past, a lot of different MicroCaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each MicroCache is uniquely identified by
its serial number here in this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it a little easier to know
which one you're connected to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I've got here is serial number 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1085.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that's connected yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to connect, we just push the big
green button on here for two seconds or
[SPEAKER_00]: so, three seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this little LED will start flashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we click on this plus button up here
to add a new device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It searches for the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It quickly finds it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called MicroCache 1085.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the default name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets it the factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just tap on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this SQ500 is the correct
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it wasn't, you could just click on
Choose Model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can scroll through and choose the
model that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hit Cancel because it was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could enter a custom calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, this one just has a
standard factory calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wanted to, you could enter a
new calibration number in there to
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply your millivolt value and get a
calibrated value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could rename it here whatever we
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll just leave it MicroCache 1085
for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this thing that we just added should
be at the bottom of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is with the current micromole
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tap on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we get to kind of the more,
well, the MicroCache specific display.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get an instantaneous update of the
micromole value.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we cover this sensor up, it should drop
to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of noise around zero,
but that's what it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we uncover it, it comes back to
that approximately five micromole value in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the live meter mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will give a graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's updated every second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now, it's just going to bop
around approximately five micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to cover this up, it'll drop
down to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go back to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: To approximately five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to point it at the lights in
here, it'll go up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to get it closer to the lights,
it'll go up even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we were outside in the sun,
of course, it would be much higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're seeing in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see they can get instantaneous
live meter mode graphical results right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on View Data, there's your
data every second for what we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, these are the manual data
collection values.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll clear this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been from before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we hit Record Current Value,
you get a timestamp, date, time,
[SPEAKER_00]: micromole value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can walk around and take values
by clicking this Record Current Value
[SPEAKER_00]: button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time you open the app,
those will still be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can export the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you click this little sharing
icon up in the top right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can select the app you want to
email it to yourself or send it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: computer in some other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will give you a CSV file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think it's a semicolon separated
file.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a tabular data file that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's the live meter mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we already went over settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over it on the static screenshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust logging and sampling
intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could turn logging on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's on, it's using up the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to save your battery,
just make sure you turn logging off in the
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you unscrew this, the MicroCache
is still logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just logging noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not logging anything good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it'll eventually eat up its
battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to turn logging off if you're
going to store this for an extended period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To reconnect it, there's a little notch on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just kind of twist it until it
falls into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you finger tighten it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to tighten it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Water correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn this on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take measurements underwater,
the light kind of bounces off the sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: more than it does in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sensor reads inaccurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've characterized that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this model, it reads 32% low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you put this correction on here,
it'll boost the values back up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct values for underwater
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not doing that, so I'll leave
that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other settings in here, including
this dark threshold, that'll help define
[SPEAKER_00]: the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down at the bottom, you get some
information about the serial number of
[SPEAKER_00]: your MicroCache and the hardware and
firmware versions and the current time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your time on the MicroCache over the
course of weeks and months might be off by
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can always go match current
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I think I matched it very
recently, so it's still very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's show you how to collect some
logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, there's just two logs available
for collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was about 20 minutes ago I last
collected logs off this device.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll just create a new data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called new data set for it's not
going to be very interesting, but we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: hit collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, we got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if they display if
there's only two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more interestingly, if there were more
than two in there, we'd see a graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hit create new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it'll be new data set five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can do, I know this one has
been logging data for about since early
[SPEAKER_00]: December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on this start time, I'm going to
hit start time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to kind of roll back the
clock by about four days to January 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to set that as my start
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my end time right now, January 30th
in the late afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's my two data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finally showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very exciting data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, here's our new logs coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were about 500 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're all collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now our display updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at new data set five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we wanted to go back, we could hit
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could switch data set and we could look
at new data set four, which was our boring
[SPEAKER_00]: data set of two data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll switch back to new data set five,
which we just collected, which is these
[SPEAKER_00]: four days of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's a diurnal
pattern as the lights come on and the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: comes up and then everything's dark at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we had an electric light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was sitting in a window inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was an electric light on it that
was on a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at night, the electric light went
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the day it was on, and then the sun
came up, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the electric light must not
have been on this day and this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: We disconnected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you can view this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on view data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see each time stamp,
date, time, micromole value every 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, so 10.30 PM, 10.40 PM,
and so on and so on, over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: time that you had data collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grab this, this thing on the
side and scroll all the way to the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the most recent one that was
collected at 420 today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next graph on this log data summary is the
daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the summary of all the PPFD
values over a 24-hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it was inside,
so we didn't get real high moles per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was around three and a half this
day and around two moles on those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hit view data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted to share it,
you'd click on that share button up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: top right corner again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we got the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a little fishy because
there's three graphs here, three bars here
[SPEAKER_00]: that are all around 24 hours per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that it was dark on these
graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's dark at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there was a little light on
over the course of the night that kept the
[SPEAKER_00]: micromole values at around three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where usually they would go down to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we can do is we hit this setting
gear, click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go back down to our dark threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put in a value of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of an unusually big value,
but just to show off this photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set the dark threshold to five,
now this photo period summary updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than 24 hours a day, now it says
it's around 12 hours a day, which makes
[SPEAKER_00]: more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In line with our graph here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone through settings, live meter,
switching data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's about all of the major
functionalities of the MicroCache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this little device will interface
with a single Apogee sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of our unamplified analog sensors have
been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little millivolt outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rugged and weatherproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope that a lot of people find a lot of
use out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
Thanks for watching.
