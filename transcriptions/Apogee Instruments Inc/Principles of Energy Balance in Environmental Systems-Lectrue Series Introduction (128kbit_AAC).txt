[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee and this is an
introduction to a seven lecture series on
[SPEAKER_00]: the principles of energy balance in
environmental systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this overview I'm going to go
through what each of the lectures
[SPEAKER_00]: discusses to give you the opportunity to
skip to certain lectures and go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: review specific things so you know exactly
what's in each of the seven lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the first lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a detailed outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that lecture I give an introduction to
water use in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water in agriculture uses at least 70% of
the water in the nation and where does all
[SPEAKER_00]: that water go?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the huge criteria here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondly, how do we exactly
measure how much of that water is used by
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is we use principles of energy
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tells us the challenge of this
whole thing and the importance of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I review several reference books on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them we use as a textbook for this
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into this first law of
thermodynamics and the seven components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latent heat of evaporation, understanding
energy and power.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Joule's and Watts and finally
short and long wave radiation and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: give you homework and the first homework
is E equals MC squared homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lecture one to let you go quickly
to that and see what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at lecture two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked about the key for the homework,
how to calculate the energy in a pea seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: units of conversions, capital C for
calories, lowercase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we calculate the efficiency of
photosynthesis and show that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: really so small we can ignore it in these
principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, absorbed shortwave radiation and
the importance of albedo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three component parts of shortwave
radiation, UV, photosynthetic and
[SPEAKER_00]: near-infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is shortwave?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's longwave?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we introduce the Stefan-Boltzmann
law for shortwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of lecture two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lecture three gets us into the concept of
emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can center these right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concept of emissivity, this is about
longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calculating longwave emitted, net longwave
and then finally bringing all the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation together in lecture three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Net absorbed shortwave and net absorbed
longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the end of the principles in
the three lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we open lecture four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applying energy balance principles to the
planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also gets into is the energy
balanced perfectly on the Earth or is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth slightly warming?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really helps you understand the
challenge of accurately measuring small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best minds in the planet are working
on this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into differential absorption
of short and longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the wavelengths are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflectance of longwave radiation,
a tiny bit is reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two critical equations that apply
to these types of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is Wien's law and the second one is
Planck's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of the fourth lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lecture five, we focus on transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have net radiation in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole lecture is all on how we
calculate transpiration, which is the flux
[SPEAKER_00]: of water and transpiration is determined
by the driving gradient for evaporation
[SPEAKER_00]: divided by the resistance to flow of these
water molecules out into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discuss absolute and relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's critical to understanding those
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flux, calculating the driving
gradient, determining stem model
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance and finally modeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all in lecture five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lecture six, I'll move it up just a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next big component part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot air blowing away hot surfaces,
blowing away to cold surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's driven by boundary layer resistance
or boundary layer conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we measure that and how do
we model the movement heat by conduction
[SPEAKER_00]: and convection?
[SPEAKER_00]: These components then compromise the whole
energy balance equation and the component
[SPEAKER_00]: parts and in the end the goal is to
calculate the movement of water through
[SPEAKER_00]: the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lecture seven, the last and final lecture,
is a summary and application of the
[SPEAKER_00]: principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at water movement in the day,
but what happens at night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sun sets and all of the surfaces
get colder than the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a clear night they radiate to the sky
and we get radiation frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things freeze even when the air
temperature is not freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through those and then finally a
summary of how do these principles apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to the very famous Penman-Monteith
equation and how do we use that to model
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rates and then finally the
much simpler Hargraves equation which is
[SPEAKER_00]: elegant in its simplicity and almost as
accurate as the Penman-Monteith.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a summary lecture of all the
principles of energy balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this introduction you can skip
around to the lectures and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that you are most interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They generally build on each other,
but it's not required that you go through
[SPEAKER_00]: an order because we expect all the viewers
are going to have different backgrounds
[SPEAKER_00]: and certain component parts are going to
be more important than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening and let the lectures
begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
