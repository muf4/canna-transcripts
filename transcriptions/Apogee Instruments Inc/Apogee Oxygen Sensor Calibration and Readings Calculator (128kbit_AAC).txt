[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, I'm John Huber, Applications
Engineer with Apogee Instruments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this video we will be going over
some of the more frequently asked
[SPEAKER_00]: questions regarding the operation and
calibration of our SO100 and 200 series
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these sensors are unique among Apogee
Instruments' product line in that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: user calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the more frequently asked
questions we get are, what are the best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for calibrating and applying the
readings from these sensors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to calibrate it, you'll first want to
set it up in an open air environment with
[SPEAKER_00]: a similar temperature, pressure,
and humidity level as the sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that you will be operating the
sensor in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got it set up in this
environment, you will want to let the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor's millivolt readings stabilize,
and then once they have, you will want to
[SPEAKER_00]: write down or record this millivolt
reading as your calibration millivolt
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have this calibration millivolt
reading, you will want to use it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: formulas listed in the SO100 and 200
manuals in order to obtain your
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration multiplier and calibration
offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have this calibration multiplier
and offset, you can use it to convert the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor's millivolt signal into a measure
of relative oxygen concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the manual can be found on our website
by going to the home page, scrolling down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the support heading, clicking technical
support, then selecting the oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors, and clicking the link product
manuals found below.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the product manual,
we have developed a calculator spreadsheet
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be posted under the helpful
articles and links section that will walk
[SPEAKER_00]: you through and run these calculations for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to use this spreadsheet, you'll want to
follow these steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, enter your sensor model.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we'll pick the SO110.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, you want to enter your calibration
millivolt reading that you recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we'll pick 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see once I enter my
calibration millivolt reading,
[SPEAKER_00]: the spreadsheet now gives me my
calibration multiplier and calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: offset that I can use to convert my
sensor's millivolt readings into a measure
[SPEAKER_00]: of relative oxygen concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: An additional thing that this spreadsheet
does is it allows you to correct for
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is important because the oxygen
sensor measures or outputs a millivolt
[SPEAKER_00]: signal based on absolute oxygen
concentrations which we convert into
[SPEAKER_00]: relative oxygen concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we don't just use absolute
concentrations is because many
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factors affect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you're at sea level,
the relative oxygen concentration in open
[SPEAKER_00]: air is going to be roughly 20.95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of Mount Everest, it's also going
to be 20.95%, but the absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of oxygen between these two
environments will be very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, keeping that in mind, when you're
using an oxygen sensor that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated in one environment and you take
it to a very different environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will need to make sure to correct its
readings for changes in temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would like more information on
why this happens and how these corrections
[SPEAKER_00]: are applied and how we came by these
equations to apply these corrections,
[SPEAKER_00]: that information can be found in the ESSO
100 and 200 product manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, let's go ahead and show
you how to enter your information into
[SPEAKER_00]: this spreadsheet and apply the
corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, you're going to want to enter
the environmental conditions for your
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration environment starting with
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's select our units for temperature
as Celsius and then let's enter a value of
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say the humidity level in your
calibration environment was 10%,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we'll go ahead and punch that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, you'll want to enter either the
elevation of your calibration environment
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to estimate the barometric
pressure of that environment or enter
[SPEAKER_00]: barometric pressure directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll enter the barometric pressure value
by clicking the button on the left here
[SPEAKER_00]: saying use calibration pressure and we
will enter the barometric pressure in kPa
[SPEAKER_00]: of the calibration environment as let's
say 89.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we have our calibration
environment conditions entered,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can move on to our sample information.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we'll want to start by entering the
sample millivolt value and let's go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: and make up a value of 44 for this
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see the spreadsheet has
already produced an uncorrected oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: reading based on the information we gave
it for the calibration readings and the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample millivolt reading that we just
entered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that millivolt reading for the
sample is a little bit lower, the oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: reading reported by this spreadsheet is
also lower at 20.4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to remember this has
not been corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your environment that you're
sampling in is different from your
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration environment, the actual
relative oxygen concentration will be
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and apply those
corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we'll need to enter our sample
environment conditions starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and enter it in Fahrenheit
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say that our sample environment
was 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, let's enter our humidity for our
sample environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that's about 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we want to enter either the
elevation or barometric pressure once
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time we'll use elevation to estimate
barometric pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll select our units as meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's say it was an elevation of
1,500 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now to apply corrections based on the
information we have entered into this
[SPEAKER_00]: sheet, simply click the check boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's correct for humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's correct for pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's correct for temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can see based on the difference
in environment conditions between the
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration environment and the sample
environment, the oxygen reading for our
[SPEAKER_00]: sample environment is 21.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once again, this is because the
temperature, pressure, and humidity have
[SPEAKER_00]: changed between the calibration
environment and the sample environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, that's why it's so important
to calibrate your oxygen sensor in an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment similar to its sampling
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: To minimize the need for these
corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if that's not an option,
you can use these corrections to correct
[SPEAKER_00]: your oxygen sensors readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, both the oxygen sensor
manual and this spreadsheet can be found
[SPEAKER_00]: in our support page for the oxygen sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also cover the subjects that are
covered in this video in very great
detail.
