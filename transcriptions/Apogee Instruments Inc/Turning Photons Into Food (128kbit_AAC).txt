[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professor of crop physiology at Utah
State University and this is a seminar
[SPEAKER_00]: about calculating potential yield of any
agricultural commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first developed for fields like
this and for outdoor agriculture but over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years we have modified this model
which is a series of calculations to get
[SPEAKER_00]: potential yield in indoor agriculture and
as we get better and better with indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture it becomes increasingly
important to understand what the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this talk in the next 20-25 minutes I'm
going to just derive the potential yield
[SPEAKER_00]: from what we call first principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first I want to acknowledge the
funding agencies for this and NASA is a
[SPEAKER_00]: key funding agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They funded the research in my lab for
over 30 years and we've been deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: indebted to NASA for allowing us to keep
refining these models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently we also got funded by the USDA
and this is a project, much more applied
[SPEAKER_00]: project, to look at the use of
supplemental lighting in controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project is called the LAMP project,
Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very basic research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very applied research project
and back and forth we zero in on the
[SPEAKER_00]: reality of what we can get for food
production in controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's now show you the units of this
calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gram per mole of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an output from the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gram of dry biomass or one gram of
yield per mole of photosynthetic photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's output divided by input which is
the efficiency of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just quickly I can show you how we
derive this and let's make sure we're on
[SPEAKER_00]: black.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gram, let's put it right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gram per meter squared of ground area
per day divided by a mole of photons per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared of ground area per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the meter squareds of days
cancel out and we get grams per mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mole per meter squared right here is
called the Daily Light Integral,
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common measurement, moles per meter
squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tricky calculating the exact area
because we get guard row effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are the input parameters to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now where do these come from and how can
we calculate yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start by examining what to any
plant biologist is the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: equation in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I show this to physicists
colleagues, they're pretty sure the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important equation in the world is E
equals MC squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important equation in the world,
particularly to any life scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equations are important inputs and they go
to outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is in every single high school
biology textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in every textbook in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 20 courses on college campuses
that emphasize this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it helps to know what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is carbohydrate, CH2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this equation by now you've figured it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes a low, let's get a different
color here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes a low energy gas, CO2,
we use it to put out fires, and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two really simple molecules, very low
energy and it makes a high energy solid
[SPEAKER_00]: food and well, O2 is rocket fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get two very high energy outputs
from two very low energy inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often, we don't think about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make students memorize the
stoichiometry, but the energetics of this
[SPEAKER_00]: are what's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember the first law of
thermodynamics says energy in equals
[SPEAKER_00]: energy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to follow the first law.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get two really low input
molecules to go to two high input
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is in more advanced books,
light and particularly photons and
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly 10 photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the close to the theoretical
minimum number of photons to push this
[SPEAKER_00]: equation across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we going to derive grams per
mole of photons from this 10 photons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every book has this in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advanced books have the photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has always disturbed me that it's
written like this because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: capture for our students the magnificence
of this equation and how do you get these
[SPEAKER_00]: high energy outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to propose that we revise
the way we write this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the earth, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is our low energy inputs and here is
our high energy outputs and it's many
[SPEAKER_00]: steps to get up there and now how do you
get uphill from low energy to high foot?
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring in those 10 photons, kaboom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of energy in those photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the energy balances because the 10
photons drive it uphill.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we calculate the efficiency of this
and efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: of any system is just the output over the
input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the output is carbohydrate and the
input is 10 photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do this ratio we get 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficient in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretical maximum 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound very good for a
theoretical maximum and engineers look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this and say oh my goodness 30% that's all
your important equation can do and this
[SPEAKER_00]: bothered me for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the biochemistry and this is not
one big step.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is many many little steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes to this and then this goes to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start to add up all those steps if
you assume there's 23 steps and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: about right and each step is 95%
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at the math in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take 0.95 to the 23rd power that's
30% efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should start thinking about
photosynthesis as 23 automated steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one's 95% efficient and out the end
we get carbohydrates and food energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where this whole analysis comes
from is this equation balancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at these 10 photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the theoretical minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: How close can we get to that when we
measure this in a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic photon flux density down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go all the way up to a thousand and this
is the quantum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ratio moles of carbon fixed per
mole of photons absorbed is called quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember I said 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 is called the quantum requirement of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1 over 10 is 0.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same thing just different units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't quite get to 10 but we get close
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of plant really doesn't matter as
long as it's a nice green leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes, spinach, different kind of
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case Grand Rapids leaf is quite a
light yellow leaf and it had a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: lower quantum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I say the leaf doesn't matter,
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple leaf lettuce that is full of
anthocyanins and anthocyanins are a
[SPEAKER_00]: protective pigment in leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absorb solar energy and they don't
fix carbon in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have purple leaf cultivars
their quantum yield is fundamentally less
[SPEAKER_00]: than nice green leaf cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only get to these very low very high
quantum yields in very low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going to be more real about
this let's assume that we're growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at 400 micromoles at more typical
and we go up here and we go across here
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're at a quantum yield of 0.08 and a
quantum requirement of 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take this now and refine our
model of grams per mole of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that carbohydrate is 30 grams per
mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbohydrate is 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen adds 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen adds 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 30 grams per mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 moles of photons gives us 30 grams of
biomass and the efficiency of this system
[SPEAKER_00]: then output over input is 30 grams per 12,
two and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is significantly higher than what we
talked about a minute ago with one gram
[SPEAKER_00]: per mole of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The key here is that this is one way when
we run the in the light the first stable
[SPEAKER_00]: product out of photosynthesis is not just
carbohydrate, it's sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're only running it one direction we
get sucrose and even sugar cane is not
[SPEAKER_00]: pure sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have proteins in plants, lipids,
lignin, cellulose, all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do those things get made if we're
running this only to get sucrose?
[SPEAKER_00]: They get made at night and they get made
continuously by running this equation
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards this direction and then we get
ATP energy and that ATP is used to
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize all the other things in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we run it backwards we call it
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration takes about 40% of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we get here about 40% is run
backwards to make everything else in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure this rigorously by canopy
gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of some of our chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little transparent chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure the gases coming in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep track of all the CO2 in this
system and we can keep track of the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: number of photons from minute to minute,
the exact rate of sucrose production and
[SPEAKER_00]: then respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now respiration runs in the light and the
dark all the time so it's running back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth so we never get two and a half grams
of biomass that would only be sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: How efficient is respiration?
60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm off the edge of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration is net photosynthesis divided
by gross photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also call that daily carbon gain
divided by gross photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ratio is about 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60, how do we get down to that number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan France was a PhD student with me
many years ago and he spent his whole time
[SPEAKER_00]: studying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't we make respiration more
efficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't we get this higher than 60%?
[SPEAKER_00]: We eventually did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We added to like 65%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't improve it much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold nights, long days, continuous light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were close to fixed at 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take two and a half, going this
way, times 60% equals, now we're down to
[SPEAKER_00]: one and a half grams per mole and we call
this number photon conversion efficacy or
[SPEAKER_00]: PCE.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first slide I said we can get one
gram per mole of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one and a half but this number
assumes every photon gets absorbed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them bounce off.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them hit the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% of the photons get absorbed and that
never happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in a perfect canopy, a few percent
bounce off and go back up to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some hit the walls and even worse,
some hit the ground without hitting a leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go from this perfect system where we
just have photosynthesis and respiration
[SPEAKER_00]: to a real system, we need a little more
sophisticated model and that sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: model is called the energy cascade model
that I've worked on with other people for
[SPEAKER_00]: many years and we have several papers
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our two parameters right here that
we're talking about and in this typical
[SPEAKER_00]: case right here I'm using 0.06 because if
it's higher light levels we get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: lower quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the very first step in this model is
fraction of absorbed photons and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number is more like 50% in typical
field production but with high planting
[SPEAKER_00]: density and maybe systems to move the
plants apart we capture more photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% times quantum yield times carbon use
efficiency gives us biomass per mole of
[SPEAKER_00]: incident photons and finally the fourth
one is called harvest index.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ratio of usable or edible
product to total plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of lettuce, this number is
80-85%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't eat the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't eat the stem base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce is almost completely edible but in
a typical crop plants we're at 50% wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: and rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be tremendous if we could get those
to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more like 40% typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get moles of carbon fixed per mole of
photons and now we multiply by 30 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: per mole and we're down to 0.4 grams per
mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well below our 1 gram per mole that I
advertised on that first slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's look at potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we have to do to get this up to 1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a set of numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we improve each one of these just
slightly we get that 80% absorbed to 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slight improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it from 0.06 to 0.08.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low light and try to it's one thing to get
0.08 but keep it there over the whole life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle when the plants are old try to still
have this high quantum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improve carbon use efficiency to 0.65.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to a very high harvest index crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply these together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at 1 gram per mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the magic 1 gram per mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the potential yield and in some
systems where we very carefully measure
[SPEAKER_00]: this we can get 1 gram per mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not an average it's a potential and
you've got to hit it every single day of
[SPEAKER_00]: the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard to do but it's still a potential
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most indoor farms that we have analyzed
are down around 0.4 grams per mole now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly because they're not absorbing all
the light up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the photons don't fall on leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way this quantum yield only is
achievable with very elevated CO2 like
[SPEAKER_00]: 1200 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 400 outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That causes photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to this number you have to have
high CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be much less than this without high
CO2 but we can enrich with CO2 in indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This approach came from this article right
here exploring the limits of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity that I wrote with my
colleague Frank Salisbury about 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's over 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular article helped launch my
career as a young scientist showing the
[SPEAKER_00]: math and showing what we could get to in
potential yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we did this with wheat and keep
track of all those parameters and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the basis of the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look after we calculate
potential yield let's do an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of indoor ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the cost of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we know we could get one gram per mole,
what's the economics of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to show you on this slide
now is the basis from this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an article we got published in
Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs for photons, physiology, and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just last year 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming tens of cents a kilowatt hour,
which is a sort of a national average,
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of photons as a percent of the market
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took the market price as high as we
could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gourmet premium quality lettuce and look
at this one and five percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No wonder people are rushing to do indoor
agriculture for leafy microgreens and for
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the facilities now where we
have five percent, they're at more like 30
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the cost of photons as a
percent of market price and that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: the systems are not yet optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can run with 30 percent energy but
they could get down to five percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at tomatoes in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes have a much lower harvest index.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw away the leaves and stems and
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only eat the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomatoes don't have as much water as
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce is 95 percent water and we only
need photosynthesis to grow to five
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tomatoes are much harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to tomatoes, we get 18 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder to grow tomatoes than these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still possible, but it's way worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to have optimal
conditions to ever think about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at other vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of broccoli we can't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stems, leaves, roots and broccoli is more
dry weight and less water and it commands,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't command the premium price that
lettuce and tomatoes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: General vegetables, the cost of the
photons is equal to the market value of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless we can find a way to get
consumers to pay a lot more for general
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, including things like
strawberries, it's going to be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult and by this analysis at 10
cents a kilowatt hour, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electric cost is going to be equal to
the market value and you still have labor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have depreciation, you have lots of
other costs besides the photon costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even worse, rice or wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of the photons is a hundred
times greater than the value of the rice
[SPEAKER_00]: and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are never going to grow our staple
crops without sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need free sunlight to grow these staple
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to look at this, the rapidly
increasing cost of photons, is the market
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are high market price.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are low market price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what drives this cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of photons up and then secondly,
the harvest index.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have a high harvest index and it
decreases down to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tomato lines that are 70% so we
could potentially do a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point here is tomatoes are much,
much harder to grow though than lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: and indoor egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's do an analysis of what we could
do and this is my final set of slides in
[SPEAKER_00]: this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we could do with solar panels and
LEDs so that we didn't have to use fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: fuels to get all that electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's analyze this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to compare, this is
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do total energy in sunlight,
it's 30 megajoules per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: day of total shortwave energy and 60
megajoules of photosynthetic photons per
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is what drives the photosynthesis
and the first step here is this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: drives solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this side first.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 moles comes through a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a design goal for a greenhouse and
obviously with this we get 42 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% of this transmitted to the plant
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's analyze this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First step, photovoltaic panels,
20% efficient so that's 30 goes to 6 moles
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared per day that is captured
as electricity from the Sun per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared of solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take the electricity, put it
through LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our very best LEDs can get to 3 micromoles
per joule of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micromoles of photons per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: M is 10 to the 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 10 to the minus 6 so this is 3
times 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 moles of photons delivered to the plant
canopy with solar photovoltaics and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: 42 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bigger number than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes more than two times the area of
solar panels to make the equivalent of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we could get in a greenhouse with
nothing just a glass greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a diagram to emphasize that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is solar panels in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.3 acres of solar panels feeding
electricity to light up one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there for direct use of solar
energy through LEDs but you say solar
[SPEAKER_00]: panels are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's calculate the potential of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we peer into the future and look
at what solar panels could be and what
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs could be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get this ratio better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the same graph potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept this the same 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might get this higher with special
coverings but let's keep this side the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go to 30% solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these, the stuff we fly on satellites,
they're expensive, they're 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible to get these and at some
point in the future we'll have consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: panels that are 30% efficient and the
reason they're so efficient is they can
[SPEAKER_00]: use energy out here in shortwave energy by
layering cells that photosynthesis can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis uses this part of the curve
and solar panels by layering them can use
[SPEAKER_00]: these low energy near infrared photons so
they get to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've captured 9 megajoules of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the theoretical maximum, if we had
100% efficient LEDs, which we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to get there but we might get to
90-95%, we can get close.
[SPEAKER_00]: 9.7 times 4.7, 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potentially we could have a system
where it's one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one acre of solar panels feeds one
acre of plants and they don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the cost of building a
greenhouse versus all these
[SPEAKER_00]: high-efficiency solar panels and LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't show economics, it just shows
energy flow in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one final slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a recent paper that is now in
review with my colleague Paula Kasuma and
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Patterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called From Physics to Fixtures to
Food, Potential Efficacy of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is peering into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers come from the chip
manufacturers of LEDs, not the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: make the fixtures, just the ones that make
the chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: How good can they get those chips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the colors we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use blues, we use reds, we use far reds
and we use whites and cool white is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most efficient of the whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is watts of photosynthetic energy
out per watt of electricity and wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: 88% for blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whites are phosphor converted blue,
so they take blue with a phosphor and we
[SPEAKER_00]: get white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some loss in that and so whites
are 80% and the reds are less and the far
[SPEAKER_00]: reds are less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is energy but remember energy
doesn't drive photosynthesis, the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of photons do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this column is the micromoles of
photons per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me review this number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is micromoles per second over joules
per second and the seconds cancel so it is
[SPEAKER_00]: just micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a joule per second is a watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it simplifies to micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these numbers, 3.3 up to 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are impressive numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have fixtures this good yet but
on the horizon we could see where they
[SPEAKER_00]: could get this this good for these colors
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got a final box here that I haven't
shown you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in that box?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's efficiency shown this way,
efficacy, what about the cost of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which do you think is the most cost
effective, the easiest to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most lighting, almost all lighting,
is for humans and so humans need white
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white LEDs are much much cheaper
just because of the economy of scale of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's look at the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, 1x for whites and we go to 10x for
reds and 30x for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These drive the cost of fixtures that
drive the cost of what we're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: in indoor agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is appearing into the future and
looking at what we can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our analysis indicates that leafy
greens can be very cost effective once we
[SPEAKER_00]: get the systems optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes would be much higher and things
like strawberries and broccoli are
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely difficult to ever produce
without free sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to another video with you.
Bye.
