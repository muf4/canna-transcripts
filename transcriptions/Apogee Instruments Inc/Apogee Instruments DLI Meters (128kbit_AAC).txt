[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments, and in the next few minutes I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to show you about the latest product
that we have just released for measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it right here, tiny, very rugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a microprocessor in it and records
so it measures the integral of light
[SPEAKER_00]: through the day and records it for 99
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to use, you can download
the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited about this project,
this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter is one that I have had running
in my conservatory at our house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I remodeled, we built a
conservatory for all my exotic plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and oh God, it's been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day I go out and check the data on
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show you what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a DLI meter, daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you what we mean when we say
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we make a little graph up here,
let me get some pen on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show this in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we make a little graph and we do dawn
to dusk, and if it's a sunny day it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice smooth curve on a sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What determines plant growth is not the
light intensity to any given moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole thing in here, all this area
under here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that you need a microprocessor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lots of Apogee meters have that,
but they're not as small and compact as
[SPEAKER_00]: rugged as this new meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shown here really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll walk you through this in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it's a cloudy day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's attempt showing a cloudy day in
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get clouds like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still adds that all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day after day gives you a different number
for each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the concept of daily light integral
and why this is so critical to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meters historically haven't had this
because you need a microprocessor that can
[SPEAKER_00]: do integrals inside the meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee's have this before but only in more
expensive meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lower cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this meter and I'll
show you what it gives you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first number right here in big,
let me put this back to, let's go with
[SPEAKER_00]: blue right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is DLI, daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: The units for this are moles of photons
per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember a standard meter gives you
micromoles per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good, but you add all those
seconds up in a day and you add all these
[SPEAKER_00]: micros up and you get moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a typical day inside a greenhouse you
might get 18.5 moles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: day of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what determines plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you some charts about how to
interpret that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ranges in the winter outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This DLI, let's put this in an even
different color right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winter now, I'm recording this in
winter, we might get 8 moles per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared per day, pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer we get 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the greenhouse we might get 4 in
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 30 in the summer because a typical
greenhouse blocks half the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you need this for inside a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also valuable for indoor agriculture
because you can use it as an immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: meter but also even making sure you got
the right daily light integral in your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse even though the lights are on
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the first number and I'll show you
in a minute how it records that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to this, it's also got timers
in it and it gives you photo period under
[SPEAKER_00]: here in hours to a tenth of an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps you understand flowering in
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into short day and
long day plants in this video,
[SPEAKER_00]: but photo period is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know if you have light
pollution, you want to know how long your
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period was, especially for medical
hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very critical number to know
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because it records, it also shows
you days ago right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one of the screens in this and
we'll walk through some of these screens
[SPEAKER_00]: in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows you the recorded data,
but what if we take this and we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the light is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I can turn it on right here,
one click of the button, show what the
[SPEAKER_00]: light is in the studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plenty bright to shoot this video,
but look we're only getting four
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per meter squared per second in
here, not enough to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the next screen look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: This is instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put inst for here and this is
DLI over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn it on, there's our number,
164.6 micromoles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a rugged, portable,
accurate meter for measuring what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it has this additional functionality
to record it for daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice in this screen, these two meters
are an example of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice one other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's blue, this one's gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: This measures, this is our classic
high-end meter for doing PAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetically active radiation,
400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter is calibrated for sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a way that we can offer you a
lower cost meter that's perfectly accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: in sunlight and then you can do
calibrations of this to get other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same detector as the Apogee
Original Quantum Sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just say it's calibrated for sunlight
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the meter that has a square wave,
a step up to give you 400 to 700
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's one more option on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've listened to other videos,
you know that we do E-PAR because of our
[SPEAKER_00]: research on photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do Extended Range PAR and we also call
this EPPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a version of this meter that
does E-PAR and EPPFD 400 to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the emerging new standard for this
and for the best accuracy, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: meter that gives you the Extended Range.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is 400 to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also 400 to 700 but calibrated for
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the three optional meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, you probably can't see these tiny
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the DLI 400 and like things go,
when the number gets higher, it gets more
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the 500 and this one is model
600.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you had a microscope, you could see
that model number right there in these
[SPEAKER_00]: meters and it tells you what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at one of these and how
it works in the screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I can just demonstrate this to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, do you want to try and zoom in on
this thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can show this little tiny
screen as big as possible for our users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you do is push the bottle button,
it's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving you PPFD just like any other
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we push the button again and it's
showing days ago zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is the total so far today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it automatically has a timer,
resets at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you the total so far today and
I just turned this one on so it only shows
[SPEAKER_00]: a short photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I push the button again, or when I do,
it goes to one day ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the one in my conservatory,
the one that actually been running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Current DLI so far today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to push it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day ago here in Logan, Utah in my
conservatory, I got 9.1 moles a day of
[SPEAKER_00]: photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is pretty good for winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little bit of supplemental
lighting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It integrated the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo period was 14.1 hours because
these supplemental lights ran longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's push it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 14.4 hours, 11.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a nice sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 9.1 three days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five days ago it was cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got 4.1 moles a day because of the
clouds in the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go, go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99 days of storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you need to sit there with a pencil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure you can do that, but there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take this meter, the bottom has two
screws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take these out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send you a little tiny screwdriver for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a very well sealed meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an IP 65 meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exceptionally rugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Users tell us they're running this
underwater in their salt water aquariums.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using it all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray it with hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has really good seals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take this little post that's
supplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can screw it in like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pull the bottom out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's the batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right here, Chris, let me zoom in on
this little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got a slide of this too,
but we'll show it live.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little USB-C port.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give you a cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Download the data to your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can download the past 99 days of
data with this cable as soon as you take
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you've got it all downloaded,
pop the bottom back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're good to go with the
screwdrivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me show you what else you can do
with this little cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is made to help mount it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice at home, I have a little tiny
tripod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mount it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can move it around nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also comes with a little stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have containers, just put it in
a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mounted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of mounting options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to these slides now and go
into some more detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been testing this thing in many
greenhouses, in many places, both for
[SPEAKER_00]: ruggedness and for examples of mounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a nice poinsettia crop on the top
of a tripod in a growers greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some lettuce on a tripod right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example of mounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's on the end of a cross arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of ways to mount this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that little stake in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it is on one of our platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture shows you a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of testing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of mounting options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have yet to have any failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I say, it's IP65.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me review that for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got room to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a new attempt to... Now I've just
put it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: IP65 is a rating of how resistant it is to
dust and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to think IP50 was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get better seals and we get to
IP55.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one stands for dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of dirt getting into it won't get
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 stands for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's two digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher you go, the better sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exceptionally well sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is with some medical hemp in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been really helpful to medical
hemp growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a close look at the screen just
to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The screen goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures high numbers in micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, micromoles per meter squared per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the standard mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the screen, that recording
screen gives you the DLI in moles,
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period in hours to a tenth of an
hour, and then how many days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you push the button,
you go back one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that, you just put a long
push and it resets right to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter, once you put the back on,
once the battery's in, the meter turns on
[SPEAKER_00]: and it automatically runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the background, the meter is always on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The screen will go blank to save battery
power, but it's always running.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a unique feature of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Batteries last six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two AAAs very quick to change the
batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saves all the data when you change
batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always running in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you put the batteries in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I just showed you,
only big.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the USC cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the batteries that are in the
compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gasketed in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right in here, it's hard to see
here, is the USB for downloading the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the screen looks like once
you download the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a standard Excel file.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see this,
but days ago, it's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI on that day and photo period on that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tells you what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another feature that we put into this
was 30 minute averages for light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: for the past 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes you want to know,
is it cloudy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it bright and sunny?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's days ago and a 30 minute
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minute average of PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we graph this data, we get up to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a nice sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we graph that data, it'd look like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd get up to 500 in the middle of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a sunny summer day, but still gives
you the average for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me walk you through the interpretation
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Jim Faust, one of our great
colleagues, visited the lab, has done a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work helping people interpret DLI
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a generic chart on DLI in
moles per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is moles per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't put the DLI in this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember I showed you some numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting about 10 in my greenhouse in
the winter at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's a list of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all flowering ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: White means too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow means just barely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be floppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green is better and red is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got red, you get plenty of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 10, I could grow most of these
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have some trouble with crops down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was medical hemp, the more the
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would want to be up to 20 or even 30
and now we go off scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go even higher than 30 with medical
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce, we'd like to be up in this
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't have lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to be up in this region here for
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 to 20 moles a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter tells us if we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search the internet for James Faust
DLI, you will get a series of maps for
[SPEAKER_00]: average DLI for places in the United
States on average and with the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not inside a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's January DLI and man these numbers
are purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean up in here, this is just not enough
light to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put some mental lights in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, it's still low, but you can
look at typical DLI values on average from
[SPEAKER_00]: a month at a time from this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's James Faust right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at Clemson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow football, you know about
Clemson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say any more than that,
but they've had a good year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me close on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've said everything I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is photo period important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some crops are short day, some crops are
long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short day crops need to be below a
threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical hemp is a short day crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we want that to be less than a
12 hour photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting photo periods 13-14
hours, you're going to have trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: getting hemp to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long day crops flower faster in long days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of our crops are long day plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat is a long day crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want long photo periods for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the photo period comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one key thing about this new DLI
meter that I got to share with you that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not so intuitively obvious, but we have
come to this as we look at crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical hemp and a lot of other crops in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, Apogee makes a light bar for
measuring light penetration to the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If light gets to the bottom, those photons
are wasted, so you want to capture the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light bar only works per second and
you measure above and below the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a greenhouse, the sun moves through the
sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to integrate that light
capture through the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the DLI meter to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a bunch of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get leaves all over the place here for
a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put this DLI meter up here in
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One meter up here for incoming light and
it comes at all angles through the day
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take a second meter and we put it
down here at the bottom of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this also integrates the light through
the day at all angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference, this is in,
this is out, and in minus out equals
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really powerful technique to
tell how your canopy is doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much light capture did it get,
and two sensors like this give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: daily light integral for both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way that you can't get if you just
have a single meter once a second in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to integrate all the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a creative use of this that's
been really useful for us in our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now following in this same principle where
we're doing capture, how about you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your greenhouse right here, your
greenhouse roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the penetration of photons inside
your greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mount one out here and you have one
inside, this doesn't have to be straight
[SPEAKER_00]: above, just above the greenhouse,
the ratio of these, this is the same math,
[SPEAKER_00]: in minus out equals absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be surprised at how much greenhouse
is absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A typical greenhouse can absorb half of
the photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people go up and clean the glass and
they go, oh my God, we should have done
[SPEAKER_00]: that years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really helps to make sure your
greenhouse is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with even electric
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to clean electric lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting a ratio of in and out integrated
through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these have been really useful
for this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to close on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the three models, the 400,
the 500, and the 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search for Apogee DLI meter,
you'll come right to this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an exciting development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been refining this for some time to
get peak accuracy and peak functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had prototypes out with a lot of
people to give us feedback on how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, this is one of the most exciting
things we've introduced in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really going to help our
users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me mention one final thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know the level up from
this, the light during the night and more
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed data, you still can buy our
microcash with sensors and download that
[SPEAKER_00]: data to your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you more detailed data than the
DLI meter, but it's also more money too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still multiple options for
measuring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pick this up in the next video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
