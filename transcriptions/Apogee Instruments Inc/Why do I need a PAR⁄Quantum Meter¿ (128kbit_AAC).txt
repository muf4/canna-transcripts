[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments and this is part of an ongoing
[SPEAKER_00]: series of principles of environmental
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about measuring
light for plant growth in just a short
[SPEAKER_00]: talk and in particular in this talk we're
going to focus on measurements of light
[SPEAKER_00]: for humans or for people and measurement
of light for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now meters to measure light for plants are
more expensive than meters to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: light for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people often buy the lower-cost meters
to measure light for people and then use
[SPEAKER_00]: them to measure light for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can result in significant errors if
you don't understand the principles and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to go through these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a meter to measure light for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foot candle meter reads out in foot
candles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an Apogee meter, looks similar to
measure light for plants and then of
[SPEAKER_00]: course you can buy these with separate
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variations but we're
going to focus on the key differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of terms for this but let's
go right to the next slide, blank slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: First I'm going to draw a line and we're
going to put 400 and 700 nanometers on
[SPEAKER_00]: this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In between this region are all the colors
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go from over here is UV and then we go
to blue, green, GRN, red and then right
[SPEAKER_00]: after this is infrared and we can't see
infrared and plants can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both plants and people see blue green
and red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we draw a curve of how well we can see
the different colors of light it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bell-shaped curve like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we can get that coming down okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see green light more than 10 times
better than either blue or red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is designed with people looking
in a box at dim light and really it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive but green light looks very
bright to us and blue and red we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn up the intensity so we can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plants see all these colors equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's plants and here's people,
humans right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is lux and foot candles,
FC, these are all the same thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different shapes of curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the colors didn't change you
could measure one and predict the other
[SPEAKER_00]: from it but the colors do change when we
go from different kinds of light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light for plants is also the same light
for any photosynthetic organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes coral and an aquarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not interested in the colors of
light that humans see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are interested in the colors of light
that plants see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a dramatic demonstration of this we
went to my laboratory at Utah State
[SPEAKER_00]: University where we're doing research on
multiple colors of light for plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to compare quantum meters
that measure light for plants with foot
[SPEAKER_00]: candle meters that measure light for
people and see the extent to which we can
[SPEAKER_00]: convert back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a trip to the lab with this
next video and see what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the chambers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all chambers that we used for
plants in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of an astronaut that's
holding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little chambers are on the space
station where we're using LEDs so we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure light for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take the first and here's a
quantum sensor, an Apogee quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a research grade foot candle
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a thousand dollar foot candle
sensor to measure light so we got that
[SPEAKER_00]: with perfect accuracy and excellent
accuracy and then the foot candle meter
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at what we get in
the first chamber with cool white
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every chamber is designed to have 200 for
quantum flux, photosynthetic radiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: then this is what the foot candles is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that first chamber, this was about
1200 and this was about 200 so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: about six times as much as this and in the
end of this we'll come back to these
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and compare these ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go to the next chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember there was a six to one ratio
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we close the door, about 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is almost an eight times ratio in
this chamber so this has equal light for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants but if you measured it for this
you'd be way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd think this should grow better plants
and it does not because the ratio changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going with chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll go from a neutral white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the color of a warm white
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close the door, keep going just a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get there, 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at this, 1300 here so yet a
different ratio even though the light for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take one more chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there was 200 and 1300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to take this sensor out of
this chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the ratio of the two there and
now we're going to go to an LED chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is red and blue LEDs, very commonly
used for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at the ratio, 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa!
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones were 1200 to 1600.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only 649.
[SPEAKER_00]: A foot-candle meter dramatically under
measures LED lights in their blue and red
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs and that shouldn't be surprising
because humans don't see red and blue
[SPEAKER_00]: light very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is green light so particularly
if there's any LEDs foot-candle meters
[SPEAKER_00]: have huge errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of these
measurements very quickly made under
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go back to our slide and
summarize this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've watched this video many times to
get these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a summary of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: First cool white, the PPF was 200,
the foot-candles was 1728 and the ratio is
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this would be okay if it's always a
6.4 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could just measure this and divide by
6.4 and predict plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look what happens when we do
neutral white.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF 200, boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: This jumps way up 7.9x.
[SPEAKER_00]: This difference right here is 23%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a foot-candle meter just with
cool white and neutral light, 23% error,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm white, that's in between 12,
15, 13, all with the exact same light for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, different ratios here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if 20% accuracy is good enough you
could get away with the foot-candle meter
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's look at LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how low that number was,
620, 3.1x.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all off by like 100% compared to
these other meters even though this would
[SPEAKER_00]: grow excellent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for any kind of precision work for
plants you really need to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetically active radiation meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called quantum meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calibrated and designed to measure
light for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the investment that people make
in growing indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend hundreds of dollars on the
lights and without a meter to measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you can't tell if your lights are
aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell why the plants are growing
better in one place than another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need a quantum sensor or a PPF
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
you you
