[SPEAKER_01]: Apogee Instruments would like to introduce
our redesigned sensor wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, maybe magic isn't quite the right
word for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does extend from 11 to 36 inches in
seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wand is easily adjustable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply twist to unlock, extend,
and then rotate to lock again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no more rods to thread or to
connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wand features a more robust design
than previous versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grip is rubberized to ensure easy
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wand is designed to be used both above
and below water, making it ideal for
[SPEAKER_01]: taking measurements in hard-to-reach
locations like up here, like over there,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The open-ended shaft allows for quick
draining and easy cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mounting plate is designed to work
flawlessly with all Apogee pyranometers
[SPEAKER_01]: and PAR sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you put it like that, maybe it is
just a little bit magic.
Thanks for watching.
