[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, I'm Bruce Bugbee and today
we're going to talk about air temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really part one in a series of
environmental measurement seminars that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've designed to educate people on the
key principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am joined in this effort by my colleague
Mark Blonquist who is the chief scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: for Apogee instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He isn't going to be doing the talking but
he and I have worked together to analyze a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide range of sensors for environmental
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start with perhaps the
most fundamental measurement of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would ask me when I was an
undergraduate, do you know how to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, oh yes, of course I know all
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would ask me as a master's student,
do I know how to measure air temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, yes, kind of,
but there's challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ask me as an experienced
scientist, do I know how to measure air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would probably say something like,
that is a really challenging measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to help bring you up to the
cutting edge of just the sensors today to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a separate talk we'll talk about
shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the simplest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of electronic sensors would you
use for air temperature measurement?
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically we've used alcohol
thermometers and mercury and glass
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometers, but those are not electronic
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't record those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a sensor that makes an
electric output so we can do continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: recording of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all about sensors that have
electronic output.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump to a picture that we've
made that shows sizes and types of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a wide range of sizes and in a
minute I'll tell you why size is so
[SPEAKER_00]: critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just run over the sizes all the
way from a human hair and look at the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.002 inches, 0.06 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tiny, just barely above that we
can get fine wire thermistors that are
[SPEAKER_00]: just barely thicker than a human hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are used in a syringe to inject
into an animal to measure internal
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of an animal, but boy they
stay very close to air temperature because
[SPEAKER_00]: they are so tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a nice sensor,
but this sensor in our long-term studies
[SPEAKER_00]: drifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a stable sensor and that's a
critical feature of these sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be rock solid year after year
after year so we're not using this fine
[SPEAKER_00]: wire sensor even though it's wonderfully
tiny because it's not solid in long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going up the scale, thermocouples are a
classic electronic way of measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're widely used, they're inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a strip of wire, twist it like
this, you've got a temperature sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are not the most accurate
reference standard and for long runs of
[SPEAKER_00]: wire they get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of thermocouple wire is about 10
times the cost of regular wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mostly use these when we need to do
lots of measurements in a small distance,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small distance from the data logger even
though they can be small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then going down the list we get into
the category of thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put a line under thermocouples,
we'll call that number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermistors are number two and
technologies, these have a big signal
[SPEAKER_00]: size, they're easy to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years these were considered not a
reference standard because they drifted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to avoid this problem with drift,
for years we've gone to platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance thermometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lots of people know these by the
acronym, PRT, Platinum Resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people say PRTD and that's just
a temperature detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the same things, PRT and PRTD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, like the typical PRTs,
is enclosed in a stainless steel sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes this extremely rugged but it's a
bigger size than this thermistor,
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, to get this even more rugged,
Apogee sells a ceramic sheath thermistor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is this enclosed in a big housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could drive over this with a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for rugged places and direct burial and
soils, this ceramic sheath thermistor is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're down to is thermistors,
particularly thermistors that are epoxy
[SPEAKER_00]: coated, to nearly eliminate water
infiltration into the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what kills sensors is when water
gets into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only two things that water doesn't
get through are metal and glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epoxy though is close.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right kinds of epoxy are almost as
impermeable as glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one has got a special epoxy
coating to make it water impermeable and
[SPEAKER_00]: as a result of that, potentially very
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got thermocouples, thermistors,
and PRTs as the categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: PRTs have long been considered the gold
standard, but they have a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big, they're expensive,
and they take up a lot of data logger
[SPEAKER_00]: channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at the effective size in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small is better, but boy, these are still
pretty small as far as temperature sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next slide shows us the effective
size on temperature rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got, these are all thermocouples
now, so we take the same measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and make it in different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at the wire diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are down here thinner than a human
hair in this part of the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all tenths of a millimeter,
small and very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put these in a controlled environment
with typical radiation loads on them and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the increase in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the difference between the true
air temperature and what the sensor gave
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 degrees C errors with big sensors in low
wind speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number over here, U, is wind speed,
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all fairly low wind speeds,
but they occur on calm days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is high radiation coming into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is intermediate radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of this whole slide is these
errors are gargantuan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to get within a few
tenths of a degree of the correct air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, you need to have a very small
sensor or make sure that sensor doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see the sunlight directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were with no shielding, and we'll
talk about that in another seminar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the value and the importance of correct
shielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, small is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The errors can be enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All PRTs are not created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, oh, I've got a PRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of a PRT?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the five classes of PRTs and their
accuracy specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus or minus 1.2 degrees C, that is not a
very accurate sensor, but we can go all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to one tenth DIN, which is an
extremely accurate PRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see these vary a lot in
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how much they vary in cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1x to 15x.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great, but they're very
expensive, and we'll compare these to
[SPEAKER_00]: thermistors in our next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done tests on these compared to
this epoxy coated thermistor that Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: uses to measure air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see how good that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here, we're going to do this
comparison of thermistors to this yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: bead PRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're going to compare in the
next few slides is class A thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intermediate accuracy, similar
advertised accuracy, plus or minus 0.1,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus or minus 0.15, 0.01.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: More expensive, but the specified accuracy
is similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did in this test is took
replicate class A PRTs and compared them
[SPEAKER_00]: to replicate thermistors, and then we
cycled them up and down and up and down,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make them fail if something's
going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to take this accelerated aging
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was with high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the worst possible scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, we can get 10 or 15 years of
aging in just three or four months by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this, but we want to know these are
going to be stable for the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did this test come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well first, PRT accuracies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not equally accurate over the
whole range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 0C, right at freezing, which is our
peak accuracy, and as we deviate from
[SPEAKER_00]: that, these accuracies get greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's the types of thermistors
and their accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of the PRT that Apogee
sells, and we've got one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the size comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee uses a shielded twisted pair cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a four wire ohm thermistor,
which we'll talk about in a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there for scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is, not on the screen,
right in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, so here's the yellow bead
thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny yellow bead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the difference in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty close, but the yellow bead is
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's smaller, it stays closer to the
air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did this test come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: After beating these things up bad,
giving them 15 years, one other key point
[SPEAKER_00]: before I show you the test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thermistor, because it has a big signal,
can be measured with one single-ended
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I'm going to put SE on here,
single-ended channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an inexpensive data logger channel,
and we can do that because it has a big
[SPEAKER_00]: signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: PRTs have such a tiny signal, at the
minimum we need to take two channels here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the data logger, but for the best
accuracy, we need to have two differential
[SPEAKER_00]: channels, a four wire system to get the
best accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is the sensor more expensive,
but all those channels on the data logger
[SPEAKER_00]: add cost to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each channel on a data logger can be
several hundred dollars, and this takes
[SPEAKER_00]: four of them compared to one up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an overlooked cost in this thing,
is the cost of these channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now what do these do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is 96 cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from minus 20 to plus 60 C,
96 times up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thermistors are shown here in blue,
the yellow beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PRTs are shown here in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we can get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are shown here in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thermistors had a slightly bigger
error in the beginning, and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of the test, the number of
cycles, they drifted more.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are offset errors right here,
so we can take those out and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, if they all read perfectly,
what would this graph look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we normalize this, and the thermistors
are rock solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're better than the class A PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for less money, you can get greater
accuracy with this yellow bead thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean all thermistors are
better, just this one that has the epoxy
[SPEAKER_00]: coating on it, which is the one that
Apogee has selected to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember I said there was better PRTs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at some one-tenth
din PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are higher quality, even more
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten months, 584 cycles, up and down,
up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The class, the one-tenth din PRTs were
much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is rock solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two replicates right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were rock solid in this test,
so it's possible to get good PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to pay more for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did these compare to the
thermistors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 12 replica thermistors against
those, 584 cycles, and then we keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We normalize them to zero here because
there's some offset, and the errors are
[SPEAKER_00]: less than five one-hundredths of a degree
C in drift of these sensors over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a more comprehensive test to
help convince us that these yellow bead
[SPEAKER_00]: thermistors were just rock solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at an application.
[SPEAKER_00]: How good do you need air temperature,
and how would these perform in a system in
[SPEAKER_00]: a severe climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out, we're in Logan, Utah,
so we can look out the window at mountains
[SPEAKER_00]: that are ten thousand feet, we're five,
a little under five thousand feet in our
[SPEAKER_00]: valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those mountain climates have very
severe weather, and one of the most famous
[SPEAKER_00]: for severe weather is a place called Peter
Sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a little bowl high up in the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold air collects in this sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets extremely cold, and it's hot in
the summer, cold in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: How cold does it get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1985, we recorded minus 69.3 Fahrenheit up
there, minus 56.3 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: This record was the lowest temperature for
Utah, the record all-time low,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was the second coldest temperature
ever recorded in the continental United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh great, second.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the coldest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rogers Pass in Montana, 69.7 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 1954, so these are long-term
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our second place, minus 69.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the all-time record, 69.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me how much accuracy of sensors
matters, and in extreme cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got second place by four-tenths of a
degree Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two-tenths of a degree Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measurements matter when you're going for
an all-time record.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this site, we have set up a weather
station that continuously records
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, and we've done test runs
with the Apogee sensors up here to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is practically summer up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snow really does melt off in the
summer, but it's a remote austere site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here is a multi-plate shield that
are commonly used on these, and then here
[SPEAKER_00]: is the Apogee aspirated shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to look at is just the
shield now, and we're going to take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: right up the bottom of this, like we're
laying on the snow looking at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the bottom looks like,
and this is the sensors inside of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two yellow beads and two PRTs,
both in the same shield, so we can do a
[SPEAKER_00]: rigorous replicate comparison of accuracy
and stability over a long term in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're both fan aspirated,
they should both be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, how severe was the
weather?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a year, almost a year of weather,
up and down, day and night, day and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has huge swings, hot in the day,
cold at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's last winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two winters ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get the all-time record right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to almost to minus 40 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the all-time record is minus 56,
but it still got cold, and up and down
[SPEAKER_00]: then finally summer came, and not many
nights it doesn't freeze up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cold place, but these swings are
enormous, so it's sensors get a beating up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the data look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that same graph with cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature difference between the two
replicate thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the scale on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus or minus 1C, right on top of each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus or minus 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, focus in on this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little spike has happened in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is classic when it happens when a
speck of moisture gets in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could have been even an insect,
and it got on one of the sensors and
[SPEAKER_00]: cooled it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the average of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less than 1 degree C, but this is not
measurement error.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just something momentarily getting
in the shield and cooling off the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine if you put an ice cube on
a sensor for a fraction of a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd easily get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a wet sponge, you'd easily get that
right to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're worried about is this
stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's zoom in on this just a bit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just those two graphs, big, even a
narrower scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus or minus 0.4 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: The replicate thermistors are very close
to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The replicate PRTs are close to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are differences from the mean of all
four sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was off by more than about 0.1,
and they were rock solid over this year
[SPEAKER_00]: period of this test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thermistors were every bit as good as
the PRTs for stability, but there's one
[SPEAKER_00]: other concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we talked about small is better,
and the smaller the sensor, the closer it
[SPEAKER_00]: stays to air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are smaller than these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a round end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in our show and tell here,
that's not much difference in size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if the sun is shining on these,
this big stainless steel one is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat up more than that tiny little V.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are also inside of aspirated
shields, so the sun shouldn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some reflected light bounced off the snow
and heated these up inside the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the mean of the thermistors,
the PRTs heated up from solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't big, it was 0.1 degrees C,
but because they were bigger, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: less accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two examples of the same thing,
the two replicate PRTs, both of them
[SPEAKER_00]: heated up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we really recommend using this
Apogee yellow bead thermistor in these
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, even inside of an aspirated
shield where they're protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saves a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really need good accuracy,
put in two replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two replicate yellow beads, and if they
don't read the same, you need to go out
[SPEAKER_00]: and check the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two replicate yellow beads is far less
expensive than one more expensive PRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the setup right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, we're going to conclude this
session on temperature sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll follow up on temperature shields in
another talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
