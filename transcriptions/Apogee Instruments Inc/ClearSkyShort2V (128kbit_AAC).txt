[SPEAKER_00]: Is your PAR meter accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know of a tool that can help you
decide whether or not your meter is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tool you can use is called the Clear
Sky Calculator and it can be found at
[SPEAKER_00]: clearskycalculator.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used to determine the accuracy
of any brand of PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, take the measurement with your
meter as close to solar noon with
[SPEAKER_00]: non-polluted skies, minimal humidity,
and the sensor perfectly level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, enter that information into the
fill and voila!
[SPEAKER_00]: It will compare your measurement to what
the ideal measurement should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thereby giving you a baseline to reference
from and determine the accuracy of your
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it is a mathematical model,
so if you have less than perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions when you take your measurement,
you'll have less than perfect results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it should help you notice any serious
accuracy problems before weeks or months
[SPEAKER_00]: where the data are lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your Apogee meter is more than 10% off,
a button will appear inviting you to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of the recalibration services
provided by Apogee instruments.

Clear Sky Calculator for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have an answer to the
question.
