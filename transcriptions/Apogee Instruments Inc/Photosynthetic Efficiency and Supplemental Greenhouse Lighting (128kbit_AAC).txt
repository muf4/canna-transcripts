[SPEAKER_01]: We teach all our students hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this was some kind of comprehensive
exam, we would ask you to define exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is that's hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we like to think that by merging
plants and soils and climate, we get
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid vigor in our department.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you learn in Plant Science 101,
that is hybrid vigor is just diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: genes mixed all together where the outcome
is better than you would ever expect from
[SPEAKER_01]: the sum of the component parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that idea, we are fortunate to
have funds for invited speakers in our
[SPEAKER_01]: department.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they come from another place,
they bring us hybrid vigor and insights to
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we might not have come up with
by ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we are honored to have Mark Van
Iersel, talk about his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was at that university in the
Netherlands that people spend their whole
[SPEAKER_01]: careers trying to pronounce the
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vageningen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the subject of a National
Geographic cover story, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: not long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Netherlands feed the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mark is a product of that university.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came here for PhD with a guy named Eric
Oosterhaus, who was a personal friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did such an outstanding job that we
were able to get him here as a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about 18 years ago or
something, long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he then went to the University of
Georgia and he recently got an endowed
[SPEAKER_01]: chair at Georgia, which gives him more
money to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's brought a lot of diverse expertise to
the study of plant physiology and
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly plant physiology and
controlled environments, using them to
[SPEAKER_01]: study things that are much broader than
the controlled environment themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see what he's going to talk to
us about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Hips is pretty excited to hear
about cannabis research with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please welcome Mark Van Iersel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll clap on this mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Bruce talks about hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might refer to it slightly as
inbreeding, given that I'm coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the university where I did my postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time here, slightly longer
than 18 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a former PhD student in the back
as the new postdoc in Bruce's lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: so not so much hybrid vigor as just
selecting elite lines at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked on controlled environment
agriculture for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really focused now on specifically
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And controlled environment agriculture is
a vague term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I talk about that, I'm basically
talking about greenhouses and vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started on this project,
about five years ago, I was initially
[SPEAKER_00]: really focused more on vertical farms than
on greenhouses because in vertical farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the light that you need to grow
your crop has to be provided from some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an electrical light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why does that matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that such a big deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a really dense engineering
report developed by the German Aerospace
[SPEAKER_00]: Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they did a hypothetical design of
what it would take to build a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical farm, 37 floors high,
and probably, given that it is German
[SPEAKER_00]: engineers, way over-engineered in many
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would probably run flawlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get the money to actually
build this, but they looked at what it
[SPEAKER_00]: would take to build this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at construction costs as
well as operating costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they did the analysis of what it
would take to operate this, it turned out
[SPEAKER_00]: that power to run this building was 60% of
annual cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of that power, about half of that,
so 30% of the overall operating cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: is needed to just run the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lights are going to produce heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the other 30% is pretty much all
air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that air conditioning is needed to
remove the heat that you get from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, and it is needed to remove water
vapor from the air because all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are producing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a massive amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we reduce how much energy it
actually takes to grow these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I was thinking about this more and
more, I came to realize greenhouses are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a much more interesting or
challenging system to work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a greenhouse just outside of
Charlotte, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the light environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That these plants are growing under.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mess, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you manage light in a greenhouse
where things are constantly changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are spatially clearly highly
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, largely because of the very
large amount of hanging baskets that are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so it's actually much more complicated
to manage lighting in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to a vertical farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in greenhouse, you obviously have
temporal variability too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just light data from one day in
the winter in our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even on a sunny day like we have here,
at some point during the day like here and
[SPEAKER_00]: here, you got shading just from the
overhead structure of your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are highly dynamic in a
greenhouse, which makes it really
[SPEAKER_00]: different from vertical farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the greenhouse industry,
we typically just integrate the total
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light that you get over the
course of a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that the daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for growing different crops,
we typically make recommendations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This crop needs a daily light integral of
Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is 14 years worth of data from
Cornell University where they monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: daily light integral every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there are seasonal
differences in daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in the middle of summer in
Cornell, you can have a daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral as low as maybe six moles per
square meter per day and as high as 70
[SPEAKER_00]: moles per square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, lots of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you manage that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you grow a crop when you don't know
what the light is going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Cornell focused a lot on lettuce
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many years, they've worked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after years of studies, what they
found out is that the one cultivar of
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce that they actually studied,
it does best if you give it a daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral of 17 moles per square meter per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that for every dot
that you see below this red line,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to provide supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you get above that red line,
you need to provide shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not that interested in shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more interested in the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see on how many days you
actually would need to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental light to reach that target of
17 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why does this matter in the greenhouse
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at a typical greenhouse
that is using supplemental lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might have 500, 400 watt high
pressure sodium lights per hectare of
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may run them for 14 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just assume that they pay 10 cents a
kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out, that they pay $280 per
hectare per day just in electricity to run
[SPEAKER_00]: their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if they run their lights for half the
year, they spend $50,000 per hectare just
[SPEAKER_00]: on electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a recent Department of Energy report,
they estimated the total cost of providing
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting in controlled environment
agriculture, and that's $600 million a
[SPEAKER_00]: year in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can reduce that by 10%, that's $60
million, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost real money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a map that shows the daily
lighting to grow in different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and different times of the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developed by Jim Foust, who is now at
Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, you have big changes
over the course of the year in how much
[SPEAKER_00]: light you can expect to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this map was initially developed to
try to get some idea of what crops can you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow where, what time of the year,
how much supplemental light might you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this makes it still pretty difficult
to actually figure out for a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, how much light do I need to give in
addition to sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last two months, I worked with
two colleagues at Cornell to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is let's assume that we
are going to grow lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to make sure that every single
day of the year, we have a daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral of 17 moles of photons per square
meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a supplemental lighting system
that can provide an instantaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photon flux of 200
micromoles per square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so using typical weather data from
around the US, we calculated the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: hours on the y-axis here of supplemental
light that you need to provide to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this example, lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can easily run this for whatever
crop you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not surprisingly, in the Southwest,
you don't need a lot of supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise in Florida, not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are big differences in how much
light you need in different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it difficult to come up with
general guidelines for is it actually cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective to install a supplemental
lighting system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along with an agricultural economist at
the University of Georgia, we tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate the return on investment of
installing a lighting system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that for two locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used Athens, Georgia, because that's
where we live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we used Seattle, Washington,
and you can probably guess why we picked
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle as the other place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if supplemental lighting is going to
pay anywhere, it is probably going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't get much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Seattle, if you provide supplemental
lighting to lettuce, you can expect to get
[SPEAKER_00]: an additional 5.3 crops a year by
providing that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a per-hectare basis, that means
that you are going to grow 200 to $283,000
[SPEAKER_00]: per year extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, the lighting isn't free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will take you about $220,000 per
hectare per year to actually pay for the
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes both installation and
operating costs of the lighting system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so net, you have an additional $63,000
per hectare per year in profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty nice amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a place like Seattle, yes,
this is probably going to be a really good
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at Athens, Georgia,
the situation is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get 2.3 extra crops a year,
which grosses you another $123,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to cost you $120,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might expect $3,000 in extra profit
from installing a lighting system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is probably not going to be worth
the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we are really interested in is
trying to help growers make these
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions based on their local climatic
conditions of whether or not it is cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for them to actually install
that lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I'm a physiologist, not an
economist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know nothing about economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I know that growers make
decisions based on expected return on
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so my part of this is to try to make
sure that we provide supplemental lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: in the most efficient way that we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we start out with a simple
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we actually quantify how
efficiently light is being used?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for that, well, hopefully we all
know that plants need light for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not exactly new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have just a very simplistic diagram
where we have sunlight providing light for
[SPEAKER_00]: the light reactions, creating ATP and
NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kelvin cycle then uses that ATP and
NADPH to fix CO2 to make carbohydrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: which the plant can then use for growth
and maintenance processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially, the light is used right here
in the light reactions of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we really want to study at a
physiological level how efficiently plants
[SPEAKER_00]: use light, then this may be a good
starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when light reaches a chloroplast,
it is absorbed by pigments molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: it bounces from one pigment molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy ultimately is funneled towards
the reaction center where that light
[SPEAKER_00]: energy is used to transfer an electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're essentially creating a current from
light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this diagram shows the entire light
reactions of photosynthesis where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty happy sun in the top left,
and it's going to provide us with a
[SPEAKER_00]: photon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the energy from that photon,
an electron from water starts moving
[SPEAKER_00]: through the electron transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stops right here because that's the
rate-limiting step in the whole process of
[SPEAKER_00]: the light reactions of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as long as this electron is right
here inside of photosystem II,
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystem II cannot accept additional
light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there was an other photon that now
gets towards photosystem II, photosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: II cannot use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, the electron moves on,
and with the help of a second photon,
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately, the electron goes to NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are really interested in this
process right here in photosystem II and
[SPEAKER_00]: how efficiently photosystem II is using
light energy to move electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not all of the light that reaches
leaves is actually used for photochromatic
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry or electron transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the light energy is actually just
converted into heat and essentially lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually is something that's actively
controlled by plants and a pretty crucial
[SPEAKER_00]: way for plants to dissipate excess light
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a very small 1% to 2% of the
absorbed photons are actually re-emitted
[SPEAKER_00]: in the form of chlorophyll fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant that you see anywhere,
if it is getting light, it is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: giving off light as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it because it is so little
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a green laser pointer and
you shine it on a leaf, you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: see a red glow coming from the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty neat when you see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out that chlorophyll
fluorescence is something that is really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just clamp the sensor here on a leaf
of sweet potato right here, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: measure how much fluorescence is coming
from that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go through the theory
behind fluorescence, but you can calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of things from chlorophyll
fluorescence measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that you can calculate is
the dark-adapted or maximum quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do that in plants that have been in
the dark for 15 to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a measurement, and it gives
you an indication whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystem II is healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If photosystem II is damaged, that maximum
quantum efficiency of photosystem II
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases, and it indicates that the
plant's under some kind of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is more interesting is that you can
also measure the intrinsic quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency in the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: How efficiently is that leaf using the
light that it is absorbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from that, we calculate something
that we call phi PS2, or the quantum yield
[SPEAKER_00]: of photosystem II, and it is the fraction
of absorbed light that is used for
[SPEAKER_00]: photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you think about supplemental
lighting, we would, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that to be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want plants to use the light that we
give them to use that light for
[SPEAKER_00]: photochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we measure the quantum yield of
photosystem II, we can actually calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate of electron transport through
photosystem II using a pretty simple
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the efficiency of photosystem
II.
[SPEAKER_00]: We multiply that by the amount of light
that is absorbed by the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we assume, typically, that leaves
absorbed about 84% of the light that hits
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we divide that by two because we
need two photons to move one electron all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way from water ultimately to NADPH,
so we can calculate electron transport
[SPEAKER_00]: rate pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my graduate student, Jeff Weaver,
did a relatively simple but pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting study about two years ago now,
where he just monitored the photochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of lettuce grown in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for 30 days, he was growing lettuce
from seedlings to full-size plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every 15 minutes, he measured the
quantum yield of photosystem II,
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated the electron transport from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when he took all of those data
points, plotted them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that with an increasing
photosynthetic photon flux, the quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield of photosystem II decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more light you give a plant,
the less efficiently it's being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing new about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we may be the first ones who have
monitored this over such a long period and
[SPEAKER_00]: so frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not really what we were after.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an important take-home message here is
that the more light a plant gets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less efficiently it uses that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use these data to calculate the
electron transport rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see an asymptotic increase in
electron transport rate with an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in photosynthetic photon flux with an
asymptote of about 130 micromoles of
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons per square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, I'm actually surprised that every
day we measure a different plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when we measure all of these
different plants, it still follows that
[SPEAKER_00]: overall trend pretty nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were really interested in was
this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the y-axis, we have the daily
photochemical integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a term you've never heard of
because we made it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did, very similar to the daily
light integral, is over the course of an
[SPEAKER_00]: entire day, we integrated all of the
electron transport rates to get to this
[SPEAKER_00]: daily photochemical integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many electrons are moved through
photosystem II in one single day?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we plotted that against the daily
light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, we get this asymptotic
increase in daily photochemical integral
[SPEAKER_00]: with an increase in daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting when we looked at
these data is that when we look at 90% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the asymptote, which is about three moles
of electron transport per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we look at the daily light integral
that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was done with lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a daily light integral of 18 moles
per square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this took us 30 days to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, using four, five years of data on
growing lattice, drew the conclusion that
[SPEAKER_00]: for lattice, you need 17 moles per square
meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much the same light level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this correlates really well with what
Cornell found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that a daily photochemical
integral of three is a really good target
[SPEAKER_00]: for growing lattice plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different crops are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did similar studies using impatiens,
which is a plant that typically grows in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see the same general decrease
right here with increasing photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did geraniums, which is a high
light plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that with geraniums,
the quantum efficiency of quantum yield of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystem II is much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a plant that is adapted to high
light levels, and it can use light more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: In itself, not that shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use the same data to calculate
electron transport rates, you see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-adapted geraniums can achieve much
higher electron transport rates than the
[SPEAKER_00]: shade species impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just important to keep in mind
that there are big differences among
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also has some interesting
implications for how you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have lights, and you want to make
sure that the light that you provide to
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop is going to be used with at
least a 60% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for impatiens, that efficiency drops
below 60% at a light level of about 150
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per square meter per level,
per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: For geranium, that efficiency doesn't drop
below 60%, or 0.6, till you get to a light
[SPEAKER_00]: level of about 530 micromoles per square
meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that you might want to
manage supplemental lighting for these two
[SPEAKER_00]: different species very differently based
on the physiology of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: To show that a different way, for
impatiens, you wouldn't want to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: more supplemental light than to reach this
level right here, 150 micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: While for geranium, you can go up to much
higher light levels, and the geraniums can
[SPEAKER_00]: still use that light that you're giving
them efficiently for the light reactions
[SPEAKER_00]: of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, for this part,
there are big differences among species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should take that into account when
you develop lighting strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main take-home message that I want
you to remember is that light is used most
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently when PPF, or light intensity,
is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that you want to provide
your supplemental lighting when there is
[SPEAKER_00]: little ambient light available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to illustrate that, so this is a light
response curve for electron transport rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you add 200 micromoles of
supplemental light to lattice plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the dark right here, you can
increase the electron transport rate by
[SPEAKER_00]: about 60 micromoles per square meter per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have 200 micromoles of sunlight,
and you add 200 micromoles of supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: light, you only get an additional 40
micromoles per square meter per second of
[SPEAKER_00]: additional electron transport for the same
amount of light that you're giving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the higher the ambient light level is,
the less efficiently the crop is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because we know that plants use
light more efficiently when you provide it
[SPEAKER_00]: at low light levels, we wanted to look at
the effect of photosynthesis on photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period on electron transport in lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Claudia Elkins, a new master student in
my lab, just finished up a study where
[SPEAKER_00]: what she did was she provided a certain
total amount of light, a certain daily
[SPEAKER_00]: light integral, over a range of different
photo periods ranging from seven to 22
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she tested this with two daily light
integrals of 15 and 20 moles per square
[SPEAKER_00]: meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was done in growth chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a picture in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a data logger that made sure
that we maintained the light level at a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly stable level over the entire
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Claudia collected chlorophyll
fluorescence measurements every 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: over the entire photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of what that looked
like inside of the growth chamber with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensing head of the chlorophyll ferometer
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at one day worth of
data, there's this average for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: replications, it looks something like this
where typically early in the day when the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights just come on, the electron
transport rate tends to be pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it reaches a steady level after
about 20 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is actually not a whole lot of
change after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes pretty boring when you measure
this for hours in a row and the values
[SPEAKER_00]: come out the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these data, what we could do then,
once again, is calculate the daily
[SPEAKER_00]: photochemical integral, the area
underneath this curve as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at them, instantaneous
quantum yield, and this is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: average over the entire photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we plot that against the
photosynthetic photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see once again, just like in the
greenhouse, that we get a decrease in the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum yield of photo system two with
higher light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so higher light levels are associated
with shorter photo periods because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: less time to provide these plants with the
same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter for this relationship
right here, if the daily light integral
[SPEAKER_00]: that we achieved over the entire photo
period was 15 or 20 moles per square meter
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really big change here in quantum yield
from about 0.68 to about 0.28 at high
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light had a tremendous effect on the
quantum yield of photo system two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much less efficient at higher light
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we calculated electron transport
rates, and just like we saw in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, we got this asymptotic
increase in electron transport rate with
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing photosynthetic photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we were more interested in than
the instantaneous values of quantum yield
[SPEAKER_00]: or electron transport is how do these
three treatments affect the daily
[SPEAKER_00]: photochemical integral?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much total electron transport can we
get with a certain amount of light that we
[SPEAKER_00]: provide?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we have the daily
photochemical integral as a function of
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can think of photo period here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we go towards longer photo periods,
the instantaneous light level is lower,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these treatments over the course
of the photo period got the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, DLI of 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, this is what we use in
the greenhouse industry to make
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations for light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much light a crop needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the daily photochemical
integral, it goes from about 2.6 to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.2 with the same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get about twice as much electron
transport if we provide that light over a
[SPEAKER_00]: longer period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is that not all photons
are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer period you spread those photons
out over, the more efficiently the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: use it, and the more electron transport
you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And presumably, the more photosynthesis
and the more growth you can get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a daily light integral of 20 moles per
square meter per day, the effect was even
[SPEAKER_00]: more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants have much more electron
transport with longer photo periods
[SPEAKER_00]: without giving them more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question after we found this is,
does this actually matter from a practical
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get better growth if you provide
the same amount of light over a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, the growers that I
work with don't seem to care very much
[SPEAKER_00]: about electron transport through
photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to avoid that term, and I talk to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see what impact that has on
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another new graduate student in my lab,
Shane Palmer, he just finished up a study
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the effects of photo period on
the growth and some physiology of leafy
[SPEAKER_00]: greens produced inside of a vertical
farm-like system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his basic hypothesis was that
longer photo periods with a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photon flux will result in
more biomass, faster growth, and shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: photo periods with high photosynthetic
photon flux because plants can use lower
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he worked with mizuna, which is a
brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting plant because it grows
unbelievably fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he suggested that we use that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had worked previously at the Kennedy
Space Center growing mizuna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have lettuce here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also worked with basil, but we don't
have those data yet, but we grew these
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of a controlled environment
chamber, walk-in chamber, 20 degrees C,
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used wide LEDs on all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We received a daily light integral of 16
moles per square meter per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but provided over six different photo
periods ranging from 10 to 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to summarize the treatments,
so we have the photo periods here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go from 10 to 20 hours, and that
meant that the photon photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: photon flux ranged from 220 to 444
micromoles per square meter per day per
[SPEAKER_00]: second to make sure that all of these
plants received the same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this graph doesn't look very good,
but I haven't had a chance yet to get my
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on the raw data, but he measured
light interception by the mizuna over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to draw your attention to
the middle part of this graph where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see right here this teal greenish
colored line are the plants grown under
[SPEAKER_00]: the longest photo period, and the red and
blue right here are the plants grown under
[SPEAKER_00]: the two shortest photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw halfway through the study that
the plants grown under longer photo
[SPEAKER_00]: periods were intercepting more of the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may suggest that the plants were
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also interesting to see that the
morphology of the plants was really
[SPEAKER_00]: different depending on the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plants that were grown under
long photo periods and low instantaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels, they were spreading their
leaves out, and they looked like solar
[SPEAKER_00]: panels that were deployed to try to
capture as much light as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the plants that were grown with the
short photo periods and high instantaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: light level, they were like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed to be avoiding light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not just reflected in the
morphology of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at chlorophyll levels in
these plants, and we just used a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-destructive meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do a true quantification,
but we have the chlorophyll content index
[SPEAKER_00]: as a function of photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants grown with short photo
periods, high light intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: had much less chlorophyll than plants
grown with long photo periods,
[SPEAKER_00]: low light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's consistent with the idea that
these plants were trying to capture as
[SPEAKER_00]: much light energy as they possibly could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we measured the quantum yield of
photo system too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that with high light intensity,
short photo period, the quantum yield is
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly lower than it is with long
photo periods and low light intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the differences
between treatments here and here,
[SPEAKER_00]: these differences are much, much smaller
than they were in the previous study that
[SPEAKER_00]: was done by Claudia Elkins that I showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She saw much bigger effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is probably because these plants
were grown constantly under these
[SPEAKER_00]: different light levels and they had a
chance to acclimate to those specific
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Claudia grew all of her plants under one
light level and then exposed them to a
[SPEAKER_00]: different light level so those plants
weren't acclimated to the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much smaller effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he collected dry weight data and
we see a general trend towards increased
[SPEAKER_00]: dry weight in Mizuna with longer photo
periods, 28% increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually pretty substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was unfortunately a lot of
variability so it wasn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was working on this
presentation early last week, I looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: this and I thought, well, that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so last Friday, Shane weighed the
lettuce plants for me so that I could look
[SPEAKER_00]: at those data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for lettuce, we see a smaller absolute
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for lettuce, we do see a significant
increase in the dry weight of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: as we grow them with longer photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just want to be emphasized,
all of these plants get the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that suggests that daily light integral
in itself may not be all that useful as a
[SPEAKER_00]: predictor of crop growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So longer photo period resulted in,
A, more light interception, higher quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield of photo system too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So combined, that means a lot more
electron transport, a lot more light
[SPEAKER_00]: energy harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for lettuce, a significant effect for
Mizuna and closely significant effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually think that looks pretty
promising and hopefully next week we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have the basal data as well to go with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned earlier, I'm actually
getting more and more interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because greenhouses have this
dynamic light environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff Weaver, who I mentioned
previously, this spring did a study where
[SPEAKER_00]: he looked at the effect of photo period on
the growth of greenhouse grown lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in his study too, we wanted to make
sure that all of these plants got the same
[SPEAKER_00]: daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really easy to do when you're in
an indoor environment and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a lot more difficult in a
greenhouse environment where you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how much sunlight you're going to get
over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we actually make sure that all
of these plants get the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light by the end of the day with a highly
variable background from minute to minute
[SPEAKER_00]: and day to day in the amount of sunlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have developed a lighting control
system that can do that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my spare time, I like to pretend that
I'm an engineer and I like to put things
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually came out of a class project
where I told a previous graduate student
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab, David Giannino, this is your
project for this class.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go build it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we do is we measure the
photosynthetic photon flux density at the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy level using a data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we want to control the amount of
light that we provide using LEDs based on
[SPEAKER_00]: how much light the crop is actually
receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use this system to either make
sure that the plants get a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: stable photosynthetic photon flux density
all day long, or we can use this to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that by the end of the photo period,
the plants have received a specific daily
[SPEAKER_00]: light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you in a few minutes how we
actually do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the principle is actually pretty
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a light, an LED light right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the sun, a quantum sensor,
a data logger, and the demo driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this right here is the beauty of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dim LEDs very, very accurately and
instantaneously, and it doesn't affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: longevity of the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a matter of microseconds,
if you want, you can completely change the
[SPEAKER_00]: light output from LED lights, and it is
really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably shouldn't tell people that it
is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should pretend this is really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, it's actually pretty
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a certain amount of
sunlight, the quantum sensor measures
[SPEAKER_00]: that, signal goes to the data logger,
and then the data logger calculates how
[SPEAKER_00]: much supplemental light do we need to
provide from the LED, and that allows us
[SPEAKER_00]: to give a specific amount of light to the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the sun gets brighter,
the LEDs automatically dim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this particular space,
in this study, Jeff grew lettuce,
[SPEAKER_00]: green towers, and regular greenhouse trays
one week after the seedlings germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started the lighting treatments and
grew the plants for 22 days under
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All treatments received a daily light
integral of 17 moles per square meter per
[SPEAKER_00]: day based on the Cornell recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they got that light in photo periods
that range from 12 to 21 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a control treatment that,
on average, received about eight moles per
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could have put standard deviations
with these treatments, but so the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in these treatments that received 17 moles
per square meter per day, the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: deviation on 17 moles was, I believe,
50 micromoles, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inaccurates that we have in this
control system are much more related to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in accuracy that we may have in
the light sensor itself than in our
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't control the light perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measure the light level every two
seconds, because that's the fastest the
[SPEAKER_00]: data logger can do everything it needs to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every two seconds, the data logger
calculates a new lighting threshold that
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the end of the day, we want to have
17 million micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We subtract from that how much light the
crop has already received.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know how much more light needs
to be provided over the rest of the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we divide that by the amount of time
that is left in the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now the data logger knows how much
light the crop needs to receive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can control the LEDs to make sure
that that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a picture of what that
looks like in the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the light sensor right here,
light bars donated by Fluence
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioengineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of the whole setup at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: No plans in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff just took this picture to show that
you can see the different demands of light
[SPEAKER_00]: that are provided by the LEDs in the
different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture near the end of the
study of plants that were grown with 12
[SPEAKER_00]: and 15-hour photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light level here, in general,
was higher than here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, too, we saw that the chlorophyll
content in these plants grown under
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter photo periods and higher light
levels were actually lower than in plants
[SPEAKER_00]: grown with longer photo periods,
very similar to what we saw indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't have all of the data from
the study yet, but Jeff has the dry weight
[SPEAKER_00]: data for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants that were grown without any
supplemental lighting, they looked
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their dry weight was really, really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't really interested in that
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a reference for everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so with supplemental lighting,
and again, all the same daily lighting to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, we can see that with longer photo
periods, there was an increase in the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we saw a 43% increase in
biomass just by providing the supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: light over longer photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty...
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited about this because that's a very
large growth increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has lots of practical
applications for managing supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a crop that is photo period
insensitive, you really should be
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading out the supplemental light over
as long a period as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, you can go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, you can actually provide
light over 24-hour periods if you choose
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage, or another advantage,
of providing lower instantaneous light
[SPEAKER_00]: levels over longer periods is that you can
install a smaller lighting system because
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need the same power to provide
high levels of instantaneous light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually makes the whole
installation of a lighting system cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can spread your light out over
longer photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the physiology that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually, I think, has direct business
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm a big believer in this company,
so shameless self-promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently started a company with a friend
of mine, and we just got a USDA grant to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually develop a lighting controller
that can automatically implement these
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of lighting strategies for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our prototype control system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a light sensor, I believe,
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I have no idea what the rest of
that stuff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this, what you can do using your
phone and Bluetooth, you can tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller, I want this daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you walk away from it,
and the controller will actually then take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of managing the lights for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall conclusions of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer photo periods have interesting
physiological effects, higher quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, greater electron transport rate
over the course of the entire day,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a greater daily photochemical index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased light interception because of
morphological responses, at least partly
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological responses to low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a practical perspective,
that also results in faster growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were able to do in these series
of studies is starting with basic
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological measurements, trying to
understand how plants use light in the
[SPEAKER_00]: light reactions of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But subsequently, actually, then come up
with practical recommendations and even a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial product that came out of this
that can now implement or take advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the physiological knowledge in a
production setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'm going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank the companies and
agencies that have funded this work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would be glad to take any questions.
Thank you.
