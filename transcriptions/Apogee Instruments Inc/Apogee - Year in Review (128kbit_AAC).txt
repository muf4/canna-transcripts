scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new company, new people, and new rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have I gotten myself into now?
[SPEAKER_00]: One year later, let me show you exactly
what I've gotten myself into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last year, I have been part of
something amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found a diverse group of unique
people, each with unique strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: A team of people who turn imagination into
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: What starts as an idea evolves into a
physical product that gets tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: tested again, and then retested until it's
finally ready for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then manufacturing, assembles those
products with speed and precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time, commitment,
and dedication from all the employees to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn conception into reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help researchers, scientists,
businesses, all achieve their aspirations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do every day makes the world a
better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: At trade shows, customers will go out of
their way to come to our booth and tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: how much they love our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of your hard work,
Apogee has grown and achieved some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: milestones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we released several highly
anticipated new products, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloudburst, the Guardian, and the Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to give our customers quality
products on time at a great price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention, we have a lot of fun along
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To all my fellow Apogee employees,
thank you for all your hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot to be excited for in
this new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: New projects and new goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a whole lot more fun.
