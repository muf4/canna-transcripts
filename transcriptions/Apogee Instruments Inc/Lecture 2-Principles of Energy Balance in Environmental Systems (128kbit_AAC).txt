[SPEAKER_00]: Start.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is day two of approximately an eight
series lectures of the energy balance
[SPEAKER_00]: principles and I want to review today a
little bit of where we got yesterday just
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly and that's why I did not
erase the board because we can put it up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key take-home message from
yesterday is we're measuring radiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: then through this latent heat of
evaporation we can calculate how much
[SPEAKER_00]: water would have to evaporate to balance
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go to a volume of water and then
multiplied by area depth of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: which the depth of water is typically the
irrigation that we tell people to put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many millimeters a day or how many
inches a day should you be putting on to
[SPEAKER_00]: balance this equation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key point we got to is if we
measure 30 megajoules a day, which
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday we got 30 megajoules,
today we're going to get 30 megajoules,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a clear day, it's summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all of that was absorbed we would have
to evaporate 12 liters of water per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 liters of water and I always think
about a meter squared, this tabletop is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not, it's close to a meter
squared, but that is a lot of water and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worth remembering because of these
volume and depth things, 12 liters of
[SPEAKER_00]: water is 1.2 centimeters of water per day
than the meter squared, the depth cancels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible to get conditions where
you have to evaporate 1.2 centimeters of
[SPEAKER_00]: water a day to balance this, but this is
an extraordinary amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we pointed out the other day,
we get more like half of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a case where something's
wrong, the typical measured evaporation is
[SPEAKER_00]: only half of what we calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either the model is wrong or the
measurements are wrong and like all
[SPEAKER_00]: science, when we start out with this we
don't know which one's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go back and look at the
measurements, we go back and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: model, and in this case the model is not
sufficiently detailed to calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a, purposely did a very simple model
yesterday and assumed if 30 comes in,
[SPEAKER_00]: every speck of that is absorbed and
evaporates water and that never happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: we never get a hundred percent absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start by dividing this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before I talk about that, yesterday we
talked about Einstein's P and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: energy you get from this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I made copies of this,
but I will and you can have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the math of this, the key for this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom out just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer, depending on exactly how
big you assume that P is, is 6,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in perfect SI units it's more like six
kilo years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using the right prefix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good chance you're going to die
from something else before you run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy in that P. And it's a pretty simple
calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the dimensional analysis of it
showing energy kilograms per meter second
[SPEAKER_00]: squared times a meter is a joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a joule is a newton per meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you work through this you get a
good sense of these the units for energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you a copy of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good time to point out one of
the reasons for using SI units.
[SPEAKER_00]: When students do this calculation in
class, they frequently get it wrong by a
[SPEAKER_00]: factor of a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the error?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wrong by a factor of a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's such a long time anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place that people make the error,
and now I need to create a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame this on the nutrition
and food science people because they got
[SPEAKER_00]: it all screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they use for energy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many calories should you eat per day?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should eat so many calories per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They capitalize the word calories and they
say when it's capitalized it means a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't capitalize words and multiply
them by a thousand except they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a calorie spelled with a capital C
is equal to a thousand calories spelled
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lowercase C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that trips people up all the time in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need 2,400 kilocalories a day and we
should get rid of this capitalized C.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on cereal boxes and it's everywhere
and you just got to know that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalize that word it's worth a thousand
times more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough when you do this
math, our energy requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.18 kilojoules per kilocalorie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look that conversion up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need about 10 megajoules a day for
energy for a typical person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an easy number to remember,
10 megajoules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you could start to think about
everything in megajoules and stuff starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you a copy of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a helpful introduction to units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to say one other
introductory thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mention this yesterday but at the
university we have a requirement for
[SPEAKER_00]: competency in writing for graduate
students and American students don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem with near native fluency but
foreign students we ask them to write an
[SPEAKER_00]: essay about something to show that they
have good command of English.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take this TOEFL test and other things
but this is an essay which I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short essay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was written by a woman from China and I
was on her committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was one of the best written
essays that I'd ever seen by a foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: student and it's about as you can see
differences in the educational system
[SPEAKER_00]: between the United States and China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she talks about her experiences in
China where memorization is prized.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can recite things and memorize them
you're just promoted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimal effort to apply the knowledge in
creative ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said I was amazed here people gave
me a page of notes for exams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to memorize I just had to
learn how to apply the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we aspire to help people
understand how to apply the information
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than memorizing it because you can
look stuff up in a book and memorization
[SPEAKER_00]: is not a goal of our education except in
some cases where I guess in the third and
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth grade we memorize addition tables
and I don't know if you memorize those or
[SPEAKER_00]: figure them out but kids have to pass
multiplication tables and but beyond that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're always looking at how to apply
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a it's a nice essay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's short and I was really touched by it
and it's part of the reason the world
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to the United States to study
because of our approach to education
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to apply the principles rather than
just memorizing the principles.
So
[SPEAKER_00]: now let's get back to this radiation and
now I can start to erase the stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep so speaking of
memorization this is a good number you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have it on a card in your pocket or
something but this is a good number to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember because you it's quickly energy
and volume of water we go back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: between those units and it's worth
mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see I'm going to keep going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always use liters but of course
2.45 kilojoules per milliliter dividing
[SPEAKER_00]: numerator and denominator by a thousand so
once you get one memorized you can quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: switch and of course a millimeter is a
gram of water it's a cubic centimeter of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just switching units quickly
back and forth and I've been my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it useful I'm using this number so
much I can flip the units in my head
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fast to fit the question that's
being asked what volume of water is
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright we get calories figured out we're
going to leave our leaf right there
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's committed this to memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got our units conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get into separating this I
thought of working this out be in as a
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative example of what how do we
calculate this 5% and I drew this and I
[SPEAKER_00]: got an example for you may give you
handout on this because everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative and calculated here's the
energy in here's photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviated zero zero and my example goes
up to full sunlight thousand watts per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared and we do our curve on here
look something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we clamp on a leaf with a
photosynthesis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them clamp on chambers and you can
measure quickly measure the photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: of the leaf so we get points in this
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we get out here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the photosynthesis and a typical
rate is 30 and this has units of
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles of carbon per meter squared per
second of leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down here we have a thousand joules per
meter squared per second same thing so the
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared per second perfectly lines
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can calculate efficiency of
photosynthesis with appropriate units
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy in energy out so efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: is output over input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real simple we've just got to get these in
the same units so we can make this
[SPEAKER_00]: calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have let's go over here output
out in thousand watt I'm going to skip
[SPEAKER_00]: right to thousand joules per meter squared
per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 micromoles of what we measure is CO2
disappearing per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously our meter squareds in our
seconds are gone and the output is moles
[SPEAKER_00]: of CO2 that have gone into the leaf and
the input is joules of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do an efficiency yet we've got to
get this in units of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from our equation which I wrote up here
CO2 I'm going to skip here becomes CH2O
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put that put all of it up here water
plus oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is elegant because one mole of CO2
becomes one mole of carbohydrate over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're measuring the uptake of CO2 but
we know there's a one-to-one relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with moles of carbon that disappear and
moles of carbon that are fixed in sugar in
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can take this times the joules
of energy in a mole of carbon I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: just say a mole of CH2O and with this the
numerator becomes joules and the
[SPEAKER_00]: denominator becomes joules and this number
this is a number you can look up in a book
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy in sucrose and this is 480
kilojoules per mole of CH2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a handout here to
make sure I get the units right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is micromoles so now we're keeping
track of this 30 times 10 to the minus
[SPEAKER_00]: sixth moles times this and now the moles
cancel 30 times 480 I can write that down
[SPEAKER_00]: here 30 times 480.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got to keep track of the prefix this
is 14.4 joules that the units come from up
[SPEAKER_00]: here divided by a thousand joules that of
energy it took to fix that amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photosynthesis in full sunlight of a
healthy leaf everything going for it one
[SPEAKER_00]: to two percent so that five percent's even
a little high average for most leaves it
[SPEAKER_00]: would only get to five percent in lower
light levels and most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations were doing high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we say we can we can ignore
photosynthesis and here's what I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote on the board in a worked out example
with with this and there's the efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: and down here 1.44.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a right away I made a mistake I
tell people never to do this model has
[SPEAKER_00]: really assumed inputs we're assuming 30
and then I wrote the answer to three
[SPEAKER_00]: significant digits and then you know I
should really say one to two or something
[SPEAKER_00]: down here but we all do that and it helps
to show that this implies you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a precise calculation and you can if
you have accurate if you knew this would
[SPEAKER_00]: precisely a thousand and you knew that was
precisely 30 but the point of this is you
[SPEAKER_00]: can it's not difficult to calculate the
energy going into photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay now let's focus on this radiation
component here and since we all get the
[SPEAKER_00]: hand down and it's up here take this off
take photosynthesis off there's
[SPEAKER_00]: one other aspect of modeling that's
significant here you could say and people
[SPEAKER_00]: do wait a minute we can measure
photosynthesis some I'll change this now
[SPEAKER_00]: to two percent and and maybe this is more
like one percent for respiration and
[SPEAKER_00]: people say well wait a minute we can
measure that we can put it in the model
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you add coefficients to the
model and add complexity you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater chance of making errors on the
primary thing it's kind of like writing
[SPEAKER_00]: down significant digits if you get too
worried about the third or fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: significant digit in a model you can make
errors on the big picture thing and in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience it's a lot better to get the
big numbers correct and really analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: them and don't worry about the small stuff
until you really need to until you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really trying to get three or four
significant digits in the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little graph is worth really
remembering both the peak of the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: the integrated total because we go back
and forth between a daily total for
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration and an instantaneous value
and when our instruments calculate this we
[SPEAKER_00]: do this in one hour time steps so we do
each number in here and it's also possible
[SPEAKER_00]: to just integrate the whole day but our
data acquisition systems do one hour time
[SPEAKER_00]: steps so now I'm going to focus on a
thousand watts in of shortwave radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to model like one hour
near solar noon when we have a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watts in so this thousand watts I think I
can let's let's get rid of this come back
[SPEAKER_00]: to some of this stuff I think I can model
this to keep my same leaf diagram up here
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the Sun and we got to have some
appropriate color for the Sun and as every
[SPEAKER_00]: school kid knows this is the appropriate
anatomy for the Sun so the sun's coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a thousand watts per meter
squared hitting that leaf and we'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a one meter squared leaf if you
hold the leaf to the Sun you can see light
[SPEAKER_00]: coming through it so light goes through
leaves so it's not all absorbed if you
[SPEAKER_00]: hold the leaf like this and look at it you
it you can see light bouncing off it so
[SPEAKER_00]: lights reflected and transmitted and we
only have to evaporate enough water to
[SPEAKER_00]: account for what's absorbed by this leaf
so we know from lots of years of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements on leaves they're all very
similar with the exception of really thick
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves like maybe a cactus but of that
thousand about 25 percent bounces off and
[SPEAKER_00]: about 25 percent is transmitted so
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly remember our model and we are off
by a factor of two between the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation of water and the input just
with this simple analysis if only half is
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by the leaf remember we had on
one side we had about 1.2 centimeters a
[SPEAKER_00]: day and then over here we had 0.6
centimeters a day this is the measured
[SPEAKER_00]: from pan evaporation all of a sudden if
only half is absorbed our two sides of our
[SPEAKER_00]: model lineup wow but we're not done it
gets more but suddenly there's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference and all we've done so far is
account for absorbed radiation so this
[SPEAKER_00]: term when I just said radiation in in a
generic sense this has to be our radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by the leaf and now equals t plus
c squared so now our challenge is to
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the absorbed radiation by a
single leaf or by a community and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to anything I mean your car parked
in the Sun we're calculating absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation to do this but it's a key first
step because you can see from this the
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb can be half of what's incident and
our it's not difficult to measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: incident coming in these are little harder
we we model them and we measure them both
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the situation so let's take
this erase this let's take this 25 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected when we calculate energy balance
for the planet Earth for anything we're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring reflected radiation and you can
look up characteristic reflectances of
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces all kinds of surfaces can look up
a piece of white paper you can look up a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of black paper and so because this
is so common in calculations we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: unique name for it albedo and and that's
the fraction of reflected radiation so
[SPEAKER_00]: we've just said for a typical leaf 25
percent as a as a round number if we did
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say what's the albedo of a black
piece of paper black paper if I drew a
[SPEAKER_00]: little thing and colored it in all black
it's about I'm not get rid of my zero it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about ten percent albedo is it is a
expressed typically as a decimal fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: not as a percent so black paper point one
white paper maybe zero point nine so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some pretty extremes and leaves
are in the middle somewhere around 25
[SPEAKER_00]: percent so I have a handout showing
typical values for some common surfaces
[SPEAKER_00]: see if we can get that on there nice and
straight and this is where we get into
[SPEAKER_00]: that's for here's white paper and black
paper and well this is really black paper
[SPEAKER_00]: I put point oh five this paper might be
sort of charcoal if it got up to point one
[SPEAKER_00]: and this paper well I had super white
paper here and this was a little off white
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's point eight but you get the idea
never mind this column just yet we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get to that here's a flat leaf 25
now plant community if a leaf is 25
[SPEAKER_00]: percent okay fine but now a plant
community we got leaves at all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: angles and the light bounces around so
typically a plant community is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit less than a single leaf because of
vertical leaves and bouncing it absorbs a
[SPEAKER_00]: light slightly better aluminum foil up
there pretty close to white paper they
[SPEAKER_00]: both reflect light pretty well in fact
I've been in a lot of discussions with
[SPEAKER_00]: growth chamber manufacturers what's the
best color for the inside of a growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber should it be reflective mylar or
should it be white and there it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: academic they're both about the same human
skin that's a good comparison 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance from our skin which brings me
to an interesting sidebar this little
[SPEAKER_00]: graph is an example out of Campbell and
Norman's book environmental biophysics
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a person in Antarctica and the
energy balance of a person in Antarctica
[SPEAKER_00]: how big of a coat do they have to wear
you'll hear you get to go out and say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a little chilly I'll go change clothes
Antarctica you have to know how cold is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be so what color should the coat
be what's the energy balance of the person
[SPEAKER_00]: working outside in a super cold condition
and here's his chest in the Sun and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the shade and I won't go through all
the details but there's an application of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy balance and now let's take that to
the limit I've had the wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of working with NASA people and
listening to lots of seminars now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a person go into outer space
on a extravehicular trip and you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: to go say it's a little chilly I'll come
in and put on thicker gloves they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: know how that person's going to work and
imagine getting every single finger at
[SPEAKER_00]: just the right temperature in the suit and
the physics are different there's no air
[SPEAKER_00]: so conduction and convection is zero and
there's no transpiration they have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything by radiation balance these
numbers are both zero so the radiation in
[SPEAKER_00]: has to equal the radiation out for this
spacesuit and and that's true of if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: on the surface of the moon there's no air
so this is all radiation balance and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's it's just an interesting example
of applications of these principles snow
[SPEAKER_00]: is a big deal look fresh clean snow as
soon as it gets a little old it drops off
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a lot to do with hydrology and
calculating how fast the snow is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: melt in the spring and come down how white
is the snow doesn't take much to drop that
[SPEAKER_00]: albedo of the snow and this drops 10% more
energies going into the snow this also
[SPEAKER_00]: brings us to a theoretically perfect black
body which is a black disc and that has an
[SPEAKER_00]: albedo by definition of 0.00 and if we ran
if it's theoretically perfect you could
[SPEAKER_00]: put 10 zeros on this it'd still be at zero
our radiometers are designed to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: black disc that's as close to
theoretically perfect as possible and you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at that little black disc and it's
supposed to look like it's a hollow cavity
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's nothing there you could put
your finger in the hole if we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically perfect black body here it
would look like some giant tube that was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a black hole and it looked like you
could put your hand right in it because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing there so it's rare we ever
get anything that good but we aspire to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this albedo of those black surfaces
as close to zero as possible so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: coming I'm going to come to this and I'm
going to come to this in a minute but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the concept of albedo and it's
easy to look up the internet that albedos
[SPEAKER_00]: for all kinds of surfaces because this is
such a big deal
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a pyranometer measuring sun in and
if we take one like this we could measure
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected out and this instrument with one
turned upside down is called an albedo
[SPEAKER_00]: meter that's and you can purchase these
and characterize surfaces so we for double
[SPEAKER_00]: the money you can measure it and if you
don't have a lot of money you model it and
[SPEAKER_00]: your but it's a critical parameter their
fraction of reflected radiation so this
[SPEAKER_00]: before I know let me let me move now from
I'm going to erase this albedo because
[SPEAKER_00]: we've all got that nailed and the albedo
meter so
[SPEAKER_00]: now let's break down radiation absorbed
equals radiation in times albedo let me
[SPEAKER_00]: take one more step here radiation short
wave SW that's that's in times albedo this
[SPEAKER_00]: other marker is slightly better times
albedo is radiation shortwave ABS absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: let me give you a handout that shows us
all worked out so we got one component of
[SPEAKER_00]: this for absorbed radiation but in a
single leaf albedo is only this fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: here so we need to put a number in here
that accounts for both absorbed and
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted so typically we have radiation
shortwave in or incident radiation times
[SPEAKER_00]: and the number we're going to put in here
is 0.5 because it accounts for both
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission and incident arc yes thank
you
[SPEAKER_00]: well it's fraction reflected yep yep a b d
e o so now we got 50% absorbed and if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to assume this a thousand
coming in here if this one's a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: times 0.5 now we have absorbed radiation
and 500 watts per meter squared of
[SPEAKER_00]: shortwave we have not yet done long wave
radiation but this is the powerhouse of
[SPEAKER_00]: the shortwave coming in from the Sun at
solar noon there's one thing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: typically add to this to make the model a
bit more accurate you can you can ignore
[SPEAKER_00]: this but almost always there is additional
radiation coming into that leaf from
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection it comes off of clouds and
bounces on the leaf and it comes off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and bounces on the leaf so in this
case if we're assuming a leaf over ground
[SPEAKER_00]: especially wet ground moist soil 10% so if
that albedo is 10% if it's moist soil now
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a thousand coming in tenths
percent 100 watts per meter square so 500
[SPEAKER_00]: plus radiation shortwave reflected so
[SPEAKER_00]: now we have 600 watts per meter squared of
radiation coming in on this leaf to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with that we're trying to either see
they're going to heat the leaf up or
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate water this is the end of the
shortwave radiation part when yes as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as these leaves cover the ground this
reflection goes to virtually zero only
[SPEAKER_00]: that this this is a still put this in as a
component because if there's clouds next
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Sun easily can get 10% off the
clouds so that's you can it can come from
[SPEAKER_00]: cloud to a another way I might have drawn
this different arrow but here's a cloud
[SPEAKER_00]: over here I could have drawn it like that
and it's still reflection and that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the case for a full canopy this goes to
zero which allows me to make a key point
[SPEAKER_00]: here lots of people panic when they find
their radiation measurements go above a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand you just told me a thousand is
clear Sun at solar noon and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: getting 1300 your instrument must be wrong
is it a partly cloudy date well yeah and I
[SPEAKER_00]: this the clouds on the size of the Sun
yeah okay we have seen 30 as high as 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected off of clouds that's really high
but 10% off of clouds this happens all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time so all of a sudden their measurements
spike and there's nothing wrong with the
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument it's reflection off of clouds
after we drill people about a clear sky
[SPEAKER_00]: number we often fail to tell them that it
can be high higher than clear sky when the
[SPEAKER_00]: clouds are like a lens and they and they
focus it of course that also has to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with people setting a range of their data
logger you want to make sure your data
[SPEAKER_00]: logger is capable of measuring numbers
higher than a thousand so this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: story with shortwave radiation from the
measurement of incident in to absorb and
[SPEAKER_00]: in this particular example we get a
thousand in and 600 absorb now obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: this can vary but it's an example and it's
roughly half to two-thirds of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in but this is only shortwave
radiation which is the energy coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sun when we look at let me draw this
up here if we put the blinds down in this
[SPEAKER_00]: room so no shortwave came in we would
still have fluxes of longwave radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: and longwave radiation comes from warm
objects not not as hot as the Sun but warm
[SPEAKER_00]: objects and it's proportional to the
temperature of the objects so if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: two objects in outer space no air no
transformation and once hotter than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other and energy is going to move by
longwave radiation from the hot one to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold and these are hundreds of watts per
meter squared of energy transfer by
[SPEAKER_00]: longwave radiation that we haven't yet
accounted for in this so we need to add
[SPEAKER_00]: that in
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see what I have for
[SPEAKER_00]: typically in the in the book in the
chapter seven that I'm following from this
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see graphs in there and I'll put
this graph over here and let me let me
[SPEAKER_00]: erase this and put the graph right here
we're still at radiation absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're going to do electromagnetic
spectrum and over here is 400 and 700 this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing is in nanometers of the
wavelength in nanometers this is
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic radiation which will come
to and if we make a curve of the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Sun it looks something like this
and this is shortwave this looks like this
[SPEAKER_00]: above the Earth's atmosphere there's no
absorption bands in this yet for water
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor and CO2 out here we get a curve that
looks something like that less intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: but a really long area and this is
longwave
[SPEAKER_00]: so this dividing line right here we
typically take as 3,000 nanometers or
[SPEAKER_00]: three micrometers the difference between
shortwave and longwave now I've roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn this to scale because it's the area
under these curves that drives the the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and the area under this curve is
roughly the same or maybe a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: than the area under this curve so longwave
transfer is a is a big deal this yes this
[SPEAKER_00]: is only thermal radiation this is
happening in a dark room you would never
[SPEAKER_00]: get photosynthesis it only it warms up the
leaf but it absolutely doesn't drive
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis well I'm on this let's
let's let's analyze shortwave radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: for a minute if we take 400 and 700
nanometers right here this is very close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the wavelengths that our human eyes can
see 400 is purple and 700 is deep red it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like the burner on a stove you can tell
it's light but you wouldn't want to read a
[SPEAKER_00]: book by it it's it's these are the
wavelengths we can see and this area under
[SPEAKER_00]: here is about 42 percent of the total
depends on sky conditions but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: rule of thumb about 42 percent drives
photosynthesis it's one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis is so inefficient it's all
this thermal radiation from the Sun out
[SPEAKER_00]: here that doesn't drive photosynthesis but
it counts as heat and it warms the leaf up
[SPEAKER_00]: this part here this tiny part of course is
ultraviolet and this is about six percent
[SPEAKER_00]: of the total then I could show this part
in red this is infrared infrared red this
[SPEAKER_00]: there we go this this red markers better
infrared out here and generally this zone
[SPEAKER_00]: in here we call near infrared because it's
close to the visible so that's all this
[SPEAKER_00]: part in here and it's 42 this is roughly
half or or like 52 percent of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation so these are three key
components of shortwave and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis so far just took lumped them all
together for the for the three because the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of this curve is important and out
here is where we get dips black line
[SPEAKER_00]: showing absorption of water vapor and co2
big dips in this band this this is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a big difference between the
extraterrestrial curve and what we measure
[SPEAKER_00]: on the surface and of course our
instruments measure what's on the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and because this here's a everybody many
people here might have seen this magnet oh
[SPEAKER_00]: I need one to show my things we made this
magnet some years ago to help show the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of this curve and now with the
wonders of this technology I can make this
[SPEAKER_00]: magnet like big and here's this curve at
the surface of the earth and it's shown in
[SPEAKER_00]: two forms the units over here are the
energy flux joules per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second and now they're per nanometer so it
just each individual wavelength and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the red line here's the UV there's a big
jump right here at 400 here's the visible
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 700 which is photosynthetic photon
flux which is what the plants can use
[SPEAKER_00]: separate instruments to measure this and
then the rest of it out here now you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see bigger energy bands this only
goes to a thousand and to complete the
[SPEAKER_00]: curve this should go to 3,000 and this
this tapers off there's less and less
[SPEAKER_00]: energy out here but and you can see the
tapering but this doesn't drop right there
[SPEAKER_00]: it keeps tapering out so this is a useful
magnet because it shows it both ways we
[SPEAKER_00]: can calculate the photon flux from this
and that's a different shape of a curve so
[SPEAKER_00]: the photon flux is what drives
photosynthesis in between here and the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy flux is what drives transpiration I
see this on lots of people's filing
[SPEAKER_00]: cabinets in their offices in different
places and that was measured here in Logan
[SPEAKER_00]: at our elevation noon solar noon on the
summer solstice so it's slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: at different times of the year but it
gives a reference on the brightest time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year
[SPEAKER_00]: well I'm on this we're not going to talk
about photosynthesis per se in this class
[SPEAKER_00]: but our instruments measure both of these
and we go back and forth between energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and photons with Planck's equation
[SPEAKER_00]: energy is HC over the wavelength speed of
light Planck's constant and the wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: and the key part of this is energy is
inversely proportional to the wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: of light I've got a handout with this
worked out and I don't have it with me
[SPEAKER_00]: today so I'll come back to this but it
helps us go back and forth between energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and photons calculating and in both units
and it's it's helpful to show a worked out
[SPEAKER_00]: example of this and I'll show it next time
so there's our solar curve with absorption
[SPEAKER_00]: bands for some of the factors in here now
let's do longwave radiation and I've just
[SPEAKER_00]: got a few minutes left before the hours up
longwave is governed
[SPEAKER_00]: I better leave that up here one other key
handout I made for us zoom out here it is
[SPEAKER_00]: this is shortwave and longwave radiation
that I drew right here above the Earth's
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere and at sea level and this is
1.5 air mass is the depth of air that the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight comes through if the Sun was
perfectly overhead that would be one but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's rarely is it perfectly overhead it's
at some angle so 1.5 is a typical amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of air for the Sun to shine through and
that's what one point five air mass is
[SPEAKER_00]: this in the winter this can be really low
angles it can be three be heavily filtered
[SPEAKER_00]: at really low angles so here's these
absorption bands and you can see how tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: the radiation gets out here it's mostly
absorbed above 2.5 this is longwave and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's lots of atmospheric absorption of
longwave radiation a perfect black body
[SPEAKER_00]: curve and then the absorption at different
wavelengths here so we would like to know
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of longwave radiation hitting
things we measure this with the black body
[SPEAKER_00]: pyranometer or some type of pyranometer
longwave we can also measure with an
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument called a pergeometer but we can
also calculate it from surface temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and to get that surface temperature
measurement here
[SPEAKER_00]: we go I love showing this picture of this
guy we go to Ludwig Boltzmann this is from
[SPEAKER_00]: a book I have of the hundred most famous
scientists in the world I think Einstein
[SPEAKER_00]: was number one Boltzmann made it to number
24 in this list and I've really enjoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: reading about some of these people because
lots of them are really eccentric
[SPEAKER_00]: Boltzmann was in and out of insane asylums
his whole life and he made it to 62 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old and he only died in 1906 but what a
crazy guy and I'll show you Max Planck in
[SPEAKER_00]: this book who is up one of the top
scientists Max Planck is had a perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: ordered life I can imagine him with the
perfectly clean desk and nothing out of
[SPEAKER_00]: order he was just the complete opposite of
Boltzmann but Boltzmann gave us what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called this and then he later like a lot
of things paired with Stefan the Stefan
[SPEAKER_00]: Boltzmann law and this is just widely used
very famous law for longwave radiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: in principle it says energy is
proportional to I always put my fish
[SPEAKER_00]: symbol in here it's proportional to
temperature so if the surface gets hotter
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy is more so that's pretty simple
so if we know the surface temperature we
[SPEAKER_00]: know the energy we use this in reverse we
measure the energy coming off a surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and we say that's that's got to be the
temperature of the surface so we use this
[SPEAKER_00]: both directions sometimes we measure
energy predict temperature sometimes we
[SPEAKER_00]: measure temperature predict energy has
nothing to do with air temperature it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all about surface temperature and to make
this better than this simple principle
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got energy equals this sigma Greek
letter sigma which is the Stefan Boltzmann
[SPEAKER_00]: constant and I've used this enough I can
remember this number it's 5.67 times 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: the minus 8 watts per meter squared per
Kelvin so here's the big significance of
[SPEAKER_00]: this wow 10 to the minus 8th you know this
has to be Kelvin's a big number but this
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a really small exponent and lots
of these constants in our equations have
[SPEAKER_00]: some really tiny some really big exponents
but here's the amazing thing about this
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of our equations have squared
something squared or the square root of
[SPEAKER_00]: something this is the only equation I know
that has temperature this is by the way
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in Kelvin to make this units
cancel its temperature to the fourth power
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's really a nonlinear relationship
with temperature but because it's Kelvin
[SPEAKER_00]: it's we're going from room temperatures
300 Kelvin so 300 times to the fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: power to maybe 305 to the fourth power but
this is the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: is this available energy we didn't good
question we didn't get into how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: this is absorbed yet which we need to this
is the total energy transmitted not all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this is absorbed because of this is a key
point but first we'll talk about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off I've got one handout and then
I'm going to stop and we're going to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: this up next time and here we go always
good when I can find my handouts this is
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's enough exponents in this here's
a worked out example Stefan Boltzmann law
[SPEAKER_00]: of equation right there 273.15 to Kelvin
so we put this to make it easy to do in a
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature in Celsius and then
you put it in an Excel spreadsheet and you
[SPEAKER_00]: run it and here's the emitted radiation
coming off the surfaces from minus 40 to
[SPEAKER_00]: plus 80 hot surface of a car might get the
plus 80 or something really hot in the Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the numbers now that's just three
columns radiation emitted 25 degrees C 448
[SPEAKER_00]: so as a rule of thumb this leaf is 25 C so
448 watts per meter squared is being given
[SPEAKER_00]: off by longwave radiation so all of a
sudden we had 600 watts of shortwave
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed wow 448 is given off by longwave
all of a sudden this leaf doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate that much water because of
longwave emission now here's then here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that will pick up next time
longwave works both ways the leaf is
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it off to the environment but down
here we have ground and let's say the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground is 25 C now we have to count plus
448 coming in so if the ground temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and the leaf are the same this net
longwave radiation cancels out and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: small number that's the simple basics next
time we'll talk about a little letter
[SPEAKER_00]: right here E which is emissivity and what
does different surfaces emit at different
[SPEAKER_00]: rates it's sort of like albedo only this
is emission not reflection so this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really key component and we'll pick it up
next time next time we should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap up all the components of longwave in
this and so we have a total absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation and how to calculate it and then
we can move on to these next components
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah you can see the two graphs down here
this is slightly nonlinear because it's t
[SPEAKER_00]: to the fourth and this is the slope of the
line so if you can estimate it between two
[SPEAKER_00]: points okay any questions that I can
answer about this you did a good job
[SPEAKER_00]: stopping me and especially when I had one
minus albedo you got to always be vigilant
[SPEAKER_00]: for for those things okay we'll see you
tomorrow you
