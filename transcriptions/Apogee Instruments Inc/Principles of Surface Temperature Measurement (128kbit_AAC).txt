[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next installment of a
series of talks on principles of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about
measurement of surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very powerful and yet very
challenging measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people make errors in this
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to help you eliminate the
errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joined in this effort by Mark
Blonquist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I have worked together for more
than 10 years trying to make accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements of surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think you could just take a
sensor and put it on a surface and measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface temperature, but let's draw a
little diagram to show the problems of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take a sensor and put it on the
surface right against to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor has some wires coming out to
go to a data logger, but as you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: this part of the sensor is touching the
surface and measuring that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here we have air temperature touching
all the rest of the sensor, so anytime you
[SPEAKER_00]: do this it's a combination of air
temperature and surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this measurement gets better if you
can get a very tiny sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better, but it's still not the true
surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people dig holes and puncture and put
sensors in here and do things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're measuring the surface plus the
temperature behind the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you try and do this with a
physical sensor you can never get the true
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use infrared sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this diagram I can draw a sensor like
this which measure only the true radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: coming right from the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a soil surface or a leaf
surface or a road surface it's the true
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at some of the
applications of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest use of Apogee sensors has been
in agriculture for canopies to model
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance or irrigation scheduling of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple of examples in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the sensors pointing at a corn
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one sensor over a small plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has allowed us to precision irrigate
crops and determine the water status of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, precision water stress plants,
by measuring the canopy surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This principle is real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's out of water heats up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's plenty of water you stay cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've joked about having a headband and a
little infrared sensor pointed at your
[SPEAKER_00]: forehead like for runners to tell when
they need to drink more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If their forehead is heating up they need
more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a huge application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another application is predicting
snowmelt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's high in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surface temperature changes rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know how fast that snow is
melting and running down.
[SPEAKER_00]: For agriculture this is a huge area of
research worldwide because tiny changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: global temperature mean that the snow
melts a lot faster and we get the water
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier and we run out at the end of the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to predict snowmelt and
there's many scientists around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: engaged in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third application is transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Icy road analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an Apogee sensor off the corner of
their truck telling when to put salt down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real-time response telling when to
put salt down on a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use these on a bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danger, ice on bridge and that's
determined by the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's start looking at some of the key
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most challenging things
to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the fraction of radiation from the
surface that gets to the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's back up and go to the
fundamental equation that starts all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is E is for energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can write this E N E R G Y equals a
constant called sigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can look it up and this is multiplied
by temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is a constant, energy is
proportional to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the temperature goes up, the energy
goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fundamentally how we tell
radiation from a surface is the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: emitted from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where it gets complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is temperature in Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a one Kelvin temperature is about 300
in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: A one degree C change is only one part in
300 parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a small change in energy but this
is one of the few things in science that
[SPEAKER_00]: is raised to the fourth power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin temperature raised to the fourth
power is energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously this is a very nonlinear
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got graphs on the website that show
this exact relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's touch this up a little bit and read
an equal sign here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only true for an object that is
infinitely black and it radiates all of
[SPEAKER_00]: its energy to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third parameter, I've hardly got room
for it but you get the idea, is
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a number that ranges from 0 to 1
and it's a multiplier times this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to know emissivity of the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's characteristic of the circus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put this constant in, this sigma,
and then we solve based on the energy we
[SPEAKER_00]: solve for the temperature of the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boltzmann came up with it, Stefan added to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fundamental to all radiation physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to know this law to use
them but it helps to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: principles, particularly this idea of
emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get accuracy we custom calibrate every
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 12 sensors in a complex oven that
controls temperature and they're further
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensor bodies are controlled at one
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The targets controlled at another
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single sensor is custom calibrated
using this device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we know temperature we can get
radiation but when we point these at
[SPEAKER_00]: something we need to know that they're
pointing at something very black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at how black that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the errors by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're specified at plus or minus 0.2
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a typical 12 sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This two times the standard deviation is
only 0.12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a generous spec to say they're
plus or minus 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the temperature range from minus
30 up to 65, 70 out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're calibrated over a wide
temperature range.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is replicate sensors on top of each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's take a look at that black
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the top off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like a hole right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cavity that's painted very flat
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cone-shaped cavity and it looks
like you could put your hand in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's called a black body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a black body has an emissivity very
close to 1.2 to 0.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact nothing really can theoretically
get to 0.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this black body is more like 0.999 and
that's how we calibrate the sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: against this black body keeping it purely
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's go back to this concept of
emissivity or forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a typical surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you some emissivities in
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant canopy can have an emissivity very
close to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wow that's so close to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just call it 1 and call it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 98% of the radiation comes from the
surface and now let's look at where the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the radiation comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part comes from the sky and this
part right here, this tiny arrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: is zero point zero two or two percent from
the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this sensor is averaging in some cases
a very cold sky temperature with the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the canopy and it's
important to correct for this in the
[SPEAKER_00]: software of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is well characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the typical emissivities of
canopies so we can use this to pin point
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fraction reflected is one minus the
emissivity so it's 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the correction factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know this is the equation but
it's more important to know the inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measured temperature of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this temperature right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Background temperature up here is the sky
temperature and degree C and then we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we typically look this number up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure this and we can solve for the
canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into the details of
this equation right here but suffice it to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that this is well described on the
Apogee website and we've described it in
[SPEAKER_00]: manuscripts we've written.
[SPEAKER_00]: The take-home message is all objects
measure the object plus averaging in some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the background temperature and if you
keep that in mind you realize that errors
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear day 25 degrees measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background is minus 40 so that's a
typical background of the very clear sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The infinity of outer space is zero Kelvin
so that's tells you why we get such cold
[SPEAKER_00]: sky temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity 0.98.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we measured was 25 and the actual
surface temperature was 25.95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost a one degree C error if we don't
account for emissivity even though this is
[SPEAKER_00]: very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a cloudy day on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sky is much warmer and this error
is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again these are examples of why it's so
important to correct for emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sensors have a cone-shaped field of
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the target right here and it's
critical to understand what you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do the trigonometry of this we called
this angle here and this angle here and
[SPEAKER_00]: now we've got a right angle and this is
the half angle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This describes how big the target is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee describes this in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio of the distance to the target to
the target diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ratio you don't need to know
trigonometry to understand that ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also describe it as the half angle
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This distance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee sells a series of sensors at
different fields of view but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: imperative to know what you're looking at
because you do not want to be averaging
[SPEAKER_00]: the sky, the sidewalks, other things off
in the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that this be small but it's
even more important that we know what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is described in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distance to target divided by target
diameter and then the angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at the area that is
measured with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This field of view that we just talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously mounting height.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher up, if this sensor is up here,
we're at the same field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see a much larger circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the second parameter and then the
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always point these down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes and often we point them like
this and now it sees an oval shaped out
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three parameters determine what
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next slide walks you through this on
what we see with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one that was 22 degrees field of
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the Apogee sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the field of view options.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are one, two, three, four options
that Apogee offers for fields of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example over a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Narrow, medium, wider, and then
rectangular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the rectangular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to see any sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to see any ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is important, Apogee has a
field of view tool that is on this website
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find this on the Apogee website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put in the type of sensor you have,
the model number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll tell you the angles and then it
tells you the area that's integrated by
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing a bunch of trigonometry
calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a worksheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You type in the inputs and it tells you
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are really to help you fully
understand what you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in the field of view, what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to be sufficiently narrow,
but it's important not to see bad things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the four options, pictures of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that rectangular, narrow,
medium, wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of options to pinpoint what you're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next critical thing is the infrared
spectral response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensors can cover a wide range,
but it's important not to measure water
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see right through the
atmosphere, right to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower quality sensors have measured much
of this radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide shows us some of the
interferences from these things on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water vapor interferes right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is water vapor in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want to measure the water vapor
in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see right through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got over here carbon dioxide
in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has bands down here that absorb,
but there is this atmosphere window,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it's called, 8 to 14 microns in which
neither water vapor nor CO2 interfere with
[SPEAKER_00]: the infrared signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee sensors are calibrated just to
measure this wavelength, which means they
[SPEAKER_00]: can see through many kilometers of
atmosphere because it's very transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that defines the sensor,
defines how it's calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's done, all you need to know is
it's calibrated to utilize the atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something you need to know on a
day-to-day basis when you're using it,
[SPEAKER_00]: except when you're correct for the
emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to know that it does
atmospheric window.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do when we're trying to measure
a canopy and it doesn't cover all the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a common problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just point it at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put it right here, we could get it,
so it's only the plant, but plants move
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to average bigger areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible to always have it right
above a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this scenario, this fraction of the
radiation is from the ground and this
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction is from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a case of partial canopy cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is measuring is both of these
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: To solve that, we put it on an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the same field of view, look at this,
all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't see the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only possible with a narrow field
of view, so you can see out over the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a common application to mount it
at an angle, so you only see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still cases with young plants
where you see some of the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next slide shows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To separate the ground from the plants,
we measure the soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put degrees C right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what we measure up here, and we
mathematically separate out the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature from the signal here and the
measured soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the approach, fraction of canopy,
fraction of ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to calculate these
fractions, and we have some manuscripts
[SPEAKER_00]: that explain doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the equation, temperature of the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all to the fourth degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power, all done in software, in the
datalogger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature of the surface, temperature of
the soil, calculating the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's start using these to calculate
what we call canopies to model
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we point these, if we put a sensor
right here, and we point it at this leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing the leaf, let's say the leaf is
slightly above air temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: two degrees above air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We write in our notebooks, this leaf is
water stressed because the leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter than the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be correct, but now the wind
comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's conduction and convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind comes up, the leaf cools off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we write in our notebooks,
oh, the water stress went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind started blowing, so we have to
measure and correct for the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun goes under a cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to measure and correct for the
effect of wind speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to measure the relative
humidity of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That determines the driving gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the air is humid, the plants are going
to warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not out of water, they just
can't cool from transpiration as fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these parameters in here are
necessary to pinpoint water stress for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants over a wide range of environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example slide that we use to
show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overriding equation for this is Rn,
which is net radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sum of this outgoing shortwave,
incoming shortwave, incoming longwave,
[SPEAKER_00]: and over here, leaf radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These four all go into net radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That equals transpiration, and I'll put TR
for transpiration, plus conduction and
[SPEAKER_00]: convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that's called H.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a simple equation, and by
measuring all these, we pinpoint the water
[SPEAKER_00]: status of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take another look at this in another
diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of equations, a lot of math,
but this is where this comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from this manuscript by Mark
Bonquist, our colleague John Norman,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the University of Wisconsin,
and myself from 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a paper that works through all of
this, and I refer you to the paper for
[SPEAKER_00]: details, but here's that equation I just
drew right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Net radiation, H is for conduction and
convection, delta E is for transpiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the energy goes into
photosynthesis in this equation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we account for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This H here is further broken down into
the canopy to air temperatures times
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us H.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's further broken down into
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This difference here is saturation vapor
pressure, so we measure these parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate transpiration, and this is
canopy and stomatal conductance to get GT
[SPEAKER_00]: canopies to model conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the parameters necessary to
measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of parameters, but the
information is extremely valuable,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we take these equations and substitute
them all in this, and this is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark's excellence in advanced algebra,
and we get an equation that integrates all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is canopy-stomatal conductance
mathematically into all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can erase my line there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This equation is all done in data loggers
with these inputs, and we've done this now
[SPEAKER_00]: over many fields to pinpoint water status,
and I'd like to show you some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next slides show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of this, it's a
physiological variable related to stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance, and everything's in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can work anywhere in the world as long
as you have these inputs to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at some of these
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at Nebraska a couple summers ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured, we'd have a model that gives
us the potential stomatal conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is well-watered, it should
transpire at the potential rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's day and night and day
and the night the stomates are closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these aren't smooth because there
was clouds and other parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is our measured parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we calculate is the ratio of these
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: How open were the stomates?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is canopy-stomatal conductance in
moles per meter squared per second,
[SPEAKER_00]: a fundamental measurement, the ratio of
actual to potential, and that's what this
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential should always be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's some cases where it got above
one, and we think this was wet leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: made this go above one because obviously
it should never get above the potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: but look what happens after a rainfall
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets less and now look at what happens
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also went down during the course of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were more open in the morning than
the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further down, further down as they dried
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's look at, this is the slope of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at what happens right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another rainfall, 20 millimeters of
rainfall happened right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomates jump back up to their
potential and even slightly above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they started that downward march
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the power of using infrared
thermometry to sort out the water
[SPEAKER_00]: potential and the stomatal conductance of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the average conductance of all of
the leaves in the field of view of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an automated measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be made day after day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's look at our next parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph now of potential canopies
to model conductance and actual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our one-to-one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're always near the potential to
fall on that line, they're close to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other environmental parameters affect
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity, wind, solar radiation,
but each case they're close to their
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened up here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, we think, wet leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the leaves are wet, we get numbers
that are above one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a few values, but this shows the
power of this technique for pinpointing
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just a few more slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: In conclusion, canopy temperatures can be
used to determine plant canopy water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress and, in this example, canopies to
model conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's simple methods to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complex methods are the ones I've
described here where we measure all the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters and account for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The complex measurements work over a wider
range of conditions than the simple
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity, that correction for that can
be significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure sky temperature and
mathematically correct that, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partial canopy cover, we need to sort that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reference to the paper we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee can give you copies of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the website, so this shows the
details of making this measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one more slide I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintenance of these sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to get a new sensor and get
accurate data, but how about week after
[SPEAKER_00]: week, month after month, getting accurate
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three things cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, optical path interferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true of all radiation measurement
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spiders right here can make a nest inside
this window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places never see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other places have a lot of spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spider nest inside that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happens, the sensor suddenly
flatlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just starts reading its own
temperature, so you can tell when it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get in there with a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so important that Apogee sells
these scientific Q-tips with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it right in that sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean that right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use some methanol to further
clean this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it can be helpful or just water,
but you got to keep that sensor clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second thing is calcium deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When sprinkler irrigation blasts this
thing day after day, if it's being hit by
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, it doesn't hurt the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very waterproof, but it evaporates
and it leaves a little film, a hard water
[SPEAKER_00]: film, on the inside window of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only happens when you have water shooting
up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That evaporates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this film.
[SPEAKER_00]: People sometimes use things like Windex.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get that off, that doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to clean calcium with a dilute
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it doesn't even have to be that
dilute because the sensor is very rugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, take the Q-tips, dip them,
and vinegar can work or a dilute acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean it with acid and it comes
right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try things like acetone to clean it,
because that doesn't clean off salt
[SPEAKER_00]: deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third biggie is dust and dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens in all windows, happens in
the windows of your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This you can clean with window cleaning
products like ammonium, cleans this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use methanol, even acetone in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key, don't push too hard because you
scratch the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the chemistry clean the window,
not mechanically screen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Apogee website that talks about
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're preparing for this Apogee
radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the summary of the principles of
making this measurement, the things you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spend your life getting better and
better at this, but you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, that this is a very powerful
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to work with you to help
collect better data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
Thank you.
