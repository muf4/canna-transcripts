[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Bruce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here because I got asked to give a
talk at a conference next week in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canberra.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a controlled environments conference
and that brought us over here and Apogee
[SPEAKER_02]: along with Peter has got a booth there but
we took the opportunity to come early to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about environmental instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're going to talk about is really
some basic stuff and I can see lots of you
[SPEAKER_02]: are interested in remote sensing and
that's on the list toward the end,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hyperspectral imaging, those
techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course as you all know that stuff
has to be ground truth and how well do we
[SPEAKER_02]: make the measurements on the ground to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now some of you do modeling and models
need good data and boy it's no surprise to
[SPEAKER_02]: know that a lot of the data we put in
models is not the highest quality data so
[SPEAKER_02]: it leads to some problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark and I have worked together for a long
time on making better environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements and along the way we develop
better instruments but I teach a class in
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental instrumentation at the
University, Utah State University and
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done other workshops on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: These instruments and that's what we're
going to try and get through today and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to make it up a little as we
go because of the timing of trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: through as much as we can and leave you
with the resources to pursue everything in
[SPEAKER_02]: more detail at the end of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to set some of the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to treat this a little like
a class and we have plenty of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our first handout and this is just
what you see on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do our best to get to everything in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate Marcus and the
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great classroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the high-tech imaging stuff to present
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of you may have seen this quote
before but it's meant as a joke but boy
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of truth in this statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody believes a measurement except
the guy who made it and nobody believes a
[SPEAKER_02]: model except the guy who came up with the
model and the gist of this is we ought to
[SPEAKER_02]: be pretty skeptical of measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these measurements we're talking
about are hard to make and when you're the
[SPEAKER_02]: guy making them you really realize how
hard they are to make and then a modeler
[SPEAKER_02]: grabs the numbers and well it's been shown
that this and this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a great quote to keep coming
back to as a reference point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then this quote, let me put these halfway
down so that we can see the screen just a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me couple this quote with a parallel
quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never believe in observation unless it can
be substantiated with theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that fine, Dr. Rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really measurements alone aren't going to
get us where we need to be and models
[SPEAKER_02]: alone aren't going to get us to where we
need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going back and forth constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: People making measurements need to be
aware of the theory behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements so you can tell when you're
collecting bad data.
[SPEAKER_02]: People making models need to work closely
with people making measurements so they
[SPEAKER_02]: can assess the quality of the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Model skills and measurement skills for
starters have been largely neglected.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we have talked about the internet
of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just throw thousands of low-cost
sensors out there and oh great what a
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe for disaster to collect a lot of
bad data fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you understand the principles which
we hope to review you can tell when the
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements aren't of the highest quality
and when you should be skeptical and
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully prevent proliferation of bad
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are two general principles
leading to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting with measurement of air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the most fundamental thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody puts air temperature in the
models.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a basis for all kinds of things and
as you'll see one of the key measurements
[SPEAKER_02]: that's very powerful is surface to air
temperature difference and leaf to air
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature difference and that's a
powerful measurement because we can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: how fast the plants are transpiring water
and Mark is going to talk about infrared
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements of surface in just a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found as we pursued this more and
more for irrigation scheduling and for
[SPEAKER_02]: hydration of plants is our measurements of
the surface temperature were often better
[SPEAKER_02]: than our measurements of the air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a company that led us to come back
to air temperature measurements and look
[SPEAKER_02]: at challenges with doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to start with air temperature
measurement and with luck single screen
[SPEAKER_02]: external video.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if we can pull this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be external video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh HD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I have to push the HDMI again.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first slide from a talk of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just principles of measuring air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to talk about two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The type of sensor that we do use to
measure air temperature and then how we
[SPEAKER_02]: shield that sensor from radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think how hard can it be to measure
air temperature but if you put a
[SPEAKER_02]: thermometer out and they almost always
read high.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any radiation coming into that
sensor it goes high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the correct air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're talking about automated
measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything we talk about is automated
hooked up to a data acquisition system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we got electronic temperature
sensors and in the history of weather
[SPEAKER_02]: measurement we have collected a lot of bad
data with higher air temperatures than
[SPEAKER_02]: really exist because of radiation hitting
the sensor and going above air
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take a look at some radiation
shields.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at all the weather stations out
there collecting data and the vast
[SPEAKER_02]: majority have one of these multi-plate
shields on them and we all pat ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: in the back and say yes that's shielded.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sensors up inside this and the sun
can't hit it and the wind blows and cools
[SPEAKER_02]: it off and we've got a great measurement
of air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true if the wind is blowing and the
sun is not shining too brightly but what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens if the wind is not blowing fast
and the sun is shining right on it or if
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun is coming at somewhat of a low
angle and it comes right into this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: These we have shown in publications can
have errors of 3 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_02]: For air temperature this is not a trivial
error.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen all the time but they
can have errors this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: A record was a place over snow in the
mountains of Utah in the winter where the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun reflected off the snow and hit these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We measured a 13 degree C temperature
error with a static shield like this and
[SPEAKER_02]: now we're people working on models of snow
melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they use that data their models are way
off there's huge errors with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Manufacturers of static shields work on
different plate configurations and
[SPEAKER_02]: different designs but they still have
problems when the wind isn't blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wind blowing means three meters a second
is enough to minimize the errors but
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a reasonable breeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about all the data collected when the
wind isn't blowing?
[SPEAKER_02]: The next level up from this is to go with
one of these kinds of sensors,
[SPEAKER_02]: shields rather, which has a fan in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an aspirated shield and now the wind
is blowing all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sensors inside are protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are far more accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They greatly minimize these errors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're talking errors of a few tenths
of a degree C instead a whole degree C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, why don't we just all switch to
these if they're demonstrably more
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is they're expensive and they
require power so if you're at a remote
[SPEAKER_02]: station with solar power some of these
shields take somewhere between 250 to 400
[SPEAKER_02]: milliamps and you start to do the
calculations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a really big panel and a really
big battery to run those or you need AC
[SPEAKER_02]: power and we don't have AC power.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the state several years ago and
we said we got to have better measurements
[SPEAKER_02]: of air temperature so we started a
research project to design a better shield
[SPEAKER_02]: and that resulted in this shield here
which has a Coanda radius inlet and we
[SPEAKER_02]: were able to get a shield that takes 30 to
80 milliamps of power.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a variable speed fan that can
slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't need the high-speed fan you
can slow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun isn't shining.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to have the fan on so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we made this aspirated shield with much
lower power and it can be now used on
[SPEAKER_02]: solar powered stations and the cost is
less, considerably less than these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the shield story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you look at temperature data
depending on what you're doing we ought to
[SPEAKER_02]: be skeptical about the wind speed at the
site.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a site with high wind speeds we're
probably fine with the static shields but
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's a site that doesn't always have
high wind speeds be careful of the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely,
[SPEAKER_02]: good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at night time there's no radiation
coming in and that data should be
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes and it's even better if there's
some breeze at night but the problem is
[SPEAKER_02]: greatly diminished at night and in fact
that's some of how when we are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: rigorous tests of these we check to see
that everything lines up at night and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's our reference and now we wait for
the next day with the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minimum temperatures at which almost
always occur at night are much more
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate than maximum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of how many models we have that are
min-max temperature from old data
[SPEAKER_02]: stations.
[SPEAKER_02]: The min's fine and the max is the daily
max every day is one or two degrees too
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big error and that's our data set
that we're working with, historic data
[SPEAKER_02]: set, but now we know yikes some of our
predictions are based on data that has
[SPEAKER_02]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple other slides of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most widely measured variable,
lots of people are studying this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 peer-reviewed papers in the last 14
years, here's a bunch of them here let's
[SPEAKER_02]: just give an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make these slides available
as PDFs so you can sit and study this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in great detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this problem is not trivial as
evidenced by the number of people studying
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these are on shield designs and
they're academic studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They built a shield to tell you the errors
of other stuff but they're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah they didn't, they weren't designed to
yield commercial solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for asking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we go back to those shields,
as soon as you get, and now I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_02]: how well I can go back, but as soon as you
get moisture on a static shield,
[SPEAKER_02]: which happens a lot if it's raining or
misting or fogging or even at night
[SPEAKER_02]: condensation on the shield, now it reads
too low because they've got evaporative
[SPEAKER_02]: cooling and it's below the true air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: That problem is also diminished by an
aspirated shield which is drawing the air
[SPEAKER_02]: through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've seen that a lot when there's any
kind of moisture on the shield you always
[SPEAKER_02]: get evaporative cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, now that Peter's got my
coffee, I got to tell you how fun it is to
[SPEAKER_02]: come to Australia and drink your coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love good coffee and this morning at the
hotel I'm complimenting him on the great
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee and they said, yeah we visited the
United States and your coffee is for shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: they said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a joy to come here and have a coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did reverse order.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's shields, now we're going to talk a
little bit about sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's three kinds of sensors that
people can put in shields and here they
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thermocouples, time-honored thermocouples.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cheap, you can run dozens of them,
hook them up to a data logger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thermistors and platinum resistance
thermometers or platinum resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: thermistors.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the three categories that are
fundamentally used.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a thermistor that's super tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first point here is small is always
better with a temperature sensor because
[SPEAKER_02]: it stays in better equilibrium with the
air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these are pretty tiny sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is only three millimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to put the old units for people in
the United States on the screen but these
[SPEAKER_02]: are all pretty small sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Platinum resistance thermometers have long
been thought to be the gold standard for
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very small signal but they're
rugged, they're stable, they're expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're slightly bigger and now I want
to show you the problems with platinum
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance thermometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thermistors in our experience are very
underrated as a technology for measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: air temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a bad rap years ago because if
moisture gets in a thermistor it can cause
[SPEAKER_02]: drift but if you can prevent moisture from
getting inside the sensor, not water but
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity, then thermistors are very very
stable and this is an epoxy coated
[SPEAKER_02]: thermistor that we've found to be very
stable in very rugged environments and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a much bigger signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our experience this is a sensor of
choice compared to PRTs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if cost was no object it's a sensor
of choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thermocouples are the least accurate of
the three.
[SPEAKER_02]: They require reference temperatures and
they're just the least accurate of the
[SPEAKER_02]: three although they're cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a lot of thermocouples.
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw the slide, small is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: PRTs are not all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think oh I have a PRT, yeah well
what kind of a PRT and you can study this
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's class C, B, A, 1 3rd, 1 10th,
DIN and here's the accuracy specs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's this yellow bead that we've
really liked and we sell this with the
[SPEAKER_02]: shields.
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.1 degree C accuracy, these are the
relative cost of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm going to show you a tiny bit of
data in which we compared these two
[SPEAKER_02]: sensors, a class A with an epoxy bead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you can see they have similar
specifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd this come out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well what we did was put them in an
accelerated aging chamber where we cycled
[SPEAKER_02]: the temperature up and down, up and down
in high humidity to try and cause failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one, accelerated aging is one
of the tests that any good instrument
[SPEAKER_02]: company runs in all their sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always try to build stuff and then we
try to make it fail and we test it and
[SPEAKER_02]: test it until we see what its limits are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: 96 cycles, minus 20 to plus 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the water it's condensing and
freezing and bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the data over the number of
cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take them out and check them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red line are the PRTs and the blue
lines are the thermistors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at this data you say well
let's normalize it to zero on day one and
[SPEAKER_02]: those thermistors were more stable than
the PRTs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an example of the kind of testing
that we do on sensors and that's led us to
[SPEAKER_02]: use this specific thermistor for air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this is the story of radiation sensors
and there's lots of data and lots of tests
[SPEAKER_02]: and lots of sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what I'd like to do next for a
few minutes is talk about humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So along with temperature we're doing
humidity and whether it's fire forecasting
[SPEAKER_02]: and we don't specifically sell a humidity
probe but there's many available.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting better all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our favorite sensors and we've
done a lot of accelerated aging testing
[SPEAKER_02]: with humidity probes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not so much going to talk about
choices among humidity sensors as I am
[SPEAKER_02]: with the principles of psychometrics,
which means what's the difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity and absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I suspect many of you in here could
write a really nice test question answer
[SPEAKER_02]: to that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But absolute humidity is what drives
pretty much all environmental responses,
[SPEAKER_02]: model responses and atmospheric humidity
responses and yet what we measure is
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take a minute to go
through this and I've taught this several
[SPEAKER_02]: times and nowadays we're going to have,
I've got plenty of these so in the end
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll stack them up at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully this will switch,
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the time-honored, there we go,
psychometric chart and what I find is
[SPEAKER_02]: modern students never seen this chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do these all the time but they just
type a number in a computer and it gives
[SPEAKER_02]: them an output and you ask them about the
relationships and they just don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the computer calculated it
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you type psychometric chart in the
internet you get thousands of images of
[SPEAKER_02]: this for different elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a chart for low temperature and
high temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, we're at 1,500 meters in Logan,
Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a 1,500 meter chart,
which is the one I happen to have but the
[SPEAKER_02]: one for sea level is very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The principles are identical and if you
overlaid them there's a, it's a small,
[SPEAKER_02]: just a small difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use this for an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are five cardinal humidity
parameters and if you know any two of
[SPEAKER_02]: those you can calculate the other three
and a computer you can type them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I want to show you is how to do
that on a chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bottom axis right here, dry bulb,
that's a manual thermometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use electronic measurements but all the
charts still say dry bulb and that just
[SPEAKER_02]: means air temperature measured with
something that's not wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So air temperature is the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing before we had fancy
electronic instruments, the second thing
[SPEAKER_02]: we measured was wet bulb and this is a
sling psychrometer and if you're older you
[SPEAKER_02]: know these things and people keep,
like slide rolls, whip them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know the humidity and swing it
and so one of these gets wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one's dry and you have to swing this
pretty good for a couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the humidity is in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Relative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this can't calculate absolute,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a little tricky but
and guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an old one and it reads out in
those ancient units called Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're at 64 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This mic charts in Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to convert.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at 75, so we're 24 Celsius in this
room, 23 Celsius and we are at 17,
[SPEAKER_02]: wet bulb 17.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's calculate the humidity with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, see these are so slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how nonlinear this chart is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old guys know how to use slide rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting really old if you still
know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of a slide roll because
you put the wet and dry bulb in here and
[SPEAKER_02]: slide it and it'll tell you the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: No batteries, no computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love these old instruments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we find this on a chart?
[SPEAKER_02]: The wet bulb temperature is read up here
on this line and what did we just say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24, so right there is 24 and 17,
here's 15, 16, here's 17, wet bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: From this line, I keep wanting to draw it
on the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go up, straight up from this here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We come in at a diagonal here
[SPEAKER_02]: so we're getting, there's our,
I hit something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it went away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It autocorrected.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's our point on the graph for what we
just measured.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting 52% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I would have swung this longer,
this probably would have come down,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the intersection of those two points
for humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've entered two things,
wet bulb and dry bulb and we calculated a
[SPEAKER_02]: third thing that relative humidity are
these curved lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm getting 52%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what else can we tell from this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dew point temperature, the temperature at
which water condenses on a surface,
[SPEAKER_02]: on a leaf, anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull a can of beer out of your fridge
and put it in your room and water
[SPEAKER_02]: condenses on it because it's below the dew
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dew point on this chart, is red sideways
going over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the second scale or it's red this
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I put my hand on something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dew point's red sideways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dew point right here, the dew point in
this room, 10, 11, 12, 13.5 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any temperature below that water will
change state and condense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Above it, it'll never happen and you can
read it either direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have dry bulb, wet bulb,
relative humidity, dew point temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: and the final parameter that we want to
know on this is the absolute humidity of
[SPEAKER_02]: the air and that's also read on this,
on this scale here and it says absolute
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in grams per kilogram and it's 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grams per, little less than 12,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I hit that again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move this over and I won't
hit it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's an example of two inputs and
you can tell how any two of these,
[SPEAKER_02]: you always get a point and then you
calculate, you spread out and you get the
[SPEAKER_02]: other three parameters from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the key thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we just did absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the mass or the moles of water vapor
and air.
[SPEAKER_02]: The absolute density, not the relative,
but here's the key thing with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're calculating rates of evaporation
from a surface, what we want to know is
[SPEAKER_02]: the absolute humidity deficit or the vapor
pressure deficit and we calculate that in
[SPEAKER_02]: computers and models all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get that from this chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this room, at this temperature,
we keep going up here to this line.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 100% humidity in this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the actual humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's take that sideways to get the
absolute humidity and it's a point right
[SPEAKER_02]: there and it looks like this is 23 and I'm
going to round this off to 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the deficit in this room is 23 minus 12
and it's this line right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the absolute humidity deficit in
this room or out wherever you measure this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what drives evaporation and
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask the question if we had a wet
dish rag here and we wanted to calculate
[SPEAKER_02]: how long it would take to dry and this is
one of my favorite test questions because
[SPEAKER_02]: you can trip students up all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In one case, we're going to put it at 80%
humidity but 30 degrees C and the other
[SPEAKER_02]: case, the other way around, you have the
80% humidity and 30 degrees C or we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to put it at 60% humidity and 15
degrees C and they said, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll dry faster in the lower humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60% humidity down here is this big of a
deficit and over here, 80% humidity is a
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So humidity interacts with temperature to
create this vapor pressure deficit which
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see from this chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need the whole chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why this subset is in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the curve and the equation for 100%
and if you know relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what we usually measure,
you can multiply the saturation by the
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity and then you can easily
calculate this without the chart because
[SPEAKER_02]: you always got a point on this chart and
here's digital values for that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's psychometrics in 10 minutes or so
and I find that useful to have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of that, intuitive
understanding so you can get a sense of
[SPEAKER_02]: when people collect bad data and how to
use humidity data to put it in units that
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'll stop here except for one
brief comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put wind on here in the first section
and this is a separate category of
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all measure wind with cup anemometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so common but an emerging
technology is sonic anemometers which I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have a picture of them here but they
measure wind speed by the speed of sound
[SPEAKER_02]: and historically those have been about a
thousand dollars for the instrument and
[SPEAKER_02]: the cup anemometers are 300 to 500 US
dollars and that's about half the price
[SPEAKER_02]: relative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic anemometers are getting cheaper and
they're more accurate and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly more accurate because at wind
speeds below a half a meter per second the
[SPEAKER_02]: cup stopped turning and that just reads a
zero and there's never really zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic anemometers go all the way down to
zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another example of the march of
technology making measurements more
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate and prices are coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we're going to see a switch
overnight to sonic anemometers but in some
[SPEAKER_02]: locations with low wind speeds sonic
anemometers are the instrument measurement
[SPEAKER_02]: of choice if you if you need to build
models in places where there's not high
[SPEAKER_02]: winds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's about all I want to say about
wind speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions that some of you have been
asking questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned the types of instruments
that you measure temperature with but how
[SPEAKER_05]: about humidity?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some things I've done it's always
related to the humidity measurement.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's related to the temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is what exactly measures the
humidity?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the device or the material?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's different ways to measure
humidity but by far the most common one is
[SPEAKER_02]: what's called a capacitance probe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a fat Sharpie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know they're roughly this size.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the end of this is a chip that changes
the capacitance based on the adsorption
[SPEAKER_02]: and desorption of water vapor molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the fundamental physics of how it
measures humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around for 20 years,
30 years and they've gotten better and
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then alongside of that is a
temperature sensor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does and those two things that's why
I did psychometrics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature and humidity together give you
the whole package for this deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember I said small is better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how big that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: These can have bigger errors in a static
shield because there's not the wind
[SPEAKER_02]: cooling off the sensor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have like to have a separate
temperature sensor and then calculate the
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This heats up because of the radiation
hitting it even inside a shield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would go man you know my humidity
is not right because that the sensor is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little hotter than it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something you can see from a
psychometric chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: These errors of heating of this tend to be
self-corrected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say the true humidity is 52 in this
room and we're measuring this and the sun
[SPEAKER_02]: shining on it and it heats up.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it heats up it goes this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the humidity goes down, automatically
goes down because it's heating up and the
[SPEAKER_02]: absolute humidity tends to be
self-correcting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humidity is wrong, the temperature is
wrong, but they're wrong in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: This data point moves horizontally on this
graph somewhere over in here because most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the time what we want to know is that
absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure if this is exactly your question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have had this problem because the
temperature is not calibrated well so the
[SPEAKER_05]: humidity is wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I wonder if there were different
types in the same way there are different
[SPEAKER_05]: types of materials that you use for the
temperature if there are different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand that most of the humidity
sensors will use this chip?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do some really expensive ways to
do humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like average and commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is by far the dominant way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk later about differences among
brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest thing we see is stability of
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get them out of a box and all of them
are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you check them again a year or two
later for drift and that's where we see
[SPEAKER_02]: differences among types.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a combination of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another reason I like this chart
because you can see what happens if you go
[SPEAKER_02]: this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's self-correcting error.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they are doing in Penman-Monteith is
a routine application.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a data logger for example, I know
Campbell Scientific data loggers really
[SPEAKER_04]: well so I'll use that as an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just go and input the weather
measurements that are necessary into an
[SPEAKER_04]: instruction that they've already
pre-programmed in the Campbell Scientific
[SPEAKER_04]: software.
[SPEAKER_04]: The input there is relative humidity and
temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: In actuality, the pre-programmed
instruction has some code running in the
[SPEAKER_04]: background.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's calculating the absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like Bruce explained, the
Penman-Monteith equation itself uses the
[SPEAKER_04]: vapor pressure deficit which is absolute
humidity minus the actual humidity of the
[SPEAKER_04]: air.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times when you see the equation
in a data logger instruction or sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: as it's explained maybe in a textbook,
they always talk about the measurement
[SPEAKER_04]: you're making is relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because the sensors that we have
measure relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have sensors to do absolute
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always calculate it from the data and
sometimes it just shows up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fundamental physics is the absolute
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's calculated in the background by the
microprocessors in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the wonderful advances of
the march of technology to do that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
