[SPEAKER_00]: This little device could save you money
and keep your indoor plants looking nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a DLI meter and it tells you
just how much of that sweet, sunshiny
[SPEAKER_00]: goodness your plants are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as like a rain gauge but for
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant needs to have light to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too little and nothing will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much and you run the risk of stressing
your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now every plant is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some need a little light while some need a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily a lot of really smart people have
done a lot of work in determining how much
[SPEAKER_00]: light specific plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good place to start is by searching DLI
requirements on the internet for the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific plant that you're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are you'll see a number like 18 moles
per meter squared per day and often
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll say that that light needs to be
over a six hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That six hour number is called the photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This DLI requirement is the amount of
light that a plant needs to thrive and be
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so we've got our DLI requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know kind of what our target is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two ways that I like to measure
DLI with this DLI meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first way is to take the DLI meter,
press and hold the button and then it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: change it into PPFD readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take those PPFD readings by
holding it at the canopy of the beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what your PPFD is and using a
calculator it'll tell you how much time
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have to reach that 18 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I like to do it that's a
little more simple and doesn't require a
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator is to just kind of take the DLI
meter and leave it there and then come
[SPEAKER_00]: back tomorrow and I can scroll through the
data from yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yesterday it says I had 20 moles over
the photo period of 13 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check I've got it over six hours and
check I'm over 18 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we know that our plants have got that
DLI requirement met we know that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike the sun outside this light is not
free and depending on the size and the
[SPEAKER_00]: scale of your operation these power
requirements can really start to add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why this DLI meter is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter can tell you when your lighting
requirements have been met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a few more ways that monitoring DLI
can help your plants grow their best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes plants need more or less light
at certain stages as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: By being able to closely monitor that
amount of light you can increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and the yield of your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a greenhouse and you're not
getting the light that you need for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to grow you can use a grow light to
supplement the light that they need so
[SPEAKER_00]: that way your plants can grow their best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changes in data can act as a canary in the
coal mine for determining larger problems
[SPEAKER_00]: such as fixture failure or power outages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end this meter is about telling you
how much light your plants are getting and
[SPEAKER_00]: when your plants get enough light you can
turn the lights off and that saves you
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
