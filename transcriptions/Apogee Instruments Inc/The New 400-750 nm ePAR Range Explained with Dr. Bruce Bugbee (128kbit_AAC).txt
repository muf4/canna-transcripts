[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, President of Apogee
Instruments and Professor of Crop
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about new
sensors from Apogee and particularly an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended range quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that an EPAR sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm first going to show you the sensors
and the model numbers and then I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go through why Apogee developed these
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from new research on the effects
of spectra on photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at these sensors
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are extended photon flux density and
the new one we call EPAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are similar price but look what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take this and put the pen on green
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, photosynthesis, we say it
starts at 400, it stops at 700,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's equal in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this area right in here is classic
photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used that for a half a century since
the days of Keith McCree as pioneering
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just wrote over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the classic Apogee sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor is a big seller for Apogee and
this one, let me put it under here,
[SPEAKER_00]: model 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the classic sensor that measured
this radiation that I just drew in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do we have other sensors if that's
the classic sensor?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are emerging definitions of
photosynthetic radiation that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, as most people know,
here it is right here, UV radiation right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has some photosynthetic effects,
not many but some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This radiation out here is far red after
700.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has significant photosynthetic
effects and I'm going to talk about those
[SPEAKER_00]: in detail in the next few minutes,
which is why we've developed sensors to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this radiation out here is called
extended PFD and Apogee has sold that
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor now for about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes all the way out to 1,000
nanometers and LED lights don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation out here so it doesn't measure
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight has lots of radiation so you
can't use that sensor in sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breakthrough is Apogee developed a
cutoff filter to cut this off right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 750 nanometers so that it now gets,
and now we got to show that in red because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's far red, it now gets this amount of
radiation in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big deal because there is a far
red LED that many manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_00]: most even, are adding to their lights and
the classic sensor doesn't catch those
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, doesn't show them at all and they
cause photosynthetic photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this new sensor, which you know
we're working on catchy titles,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is extended lowercase e,
extended PAR, model 6, SQ610, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that captures this extra radiation out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another Apogee sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show this first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call the PAR for photosynthetic
radiation right here and the FAR for the
[SPEAKER_00]: far red radiation right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor has two detectors in it and it
measures these separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures the classic PPFD, I'm going to
write that up here, classic photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: photon flux density and it also measures
the far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this sensor, of course, can add those
two numbers together to give you a total
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does them separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a terrific sensor, way cheaper
than a spectral radiometer and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: measures these two types of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is about 25% more money than the other
sensors so save up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy the classic or right now,
we'll go back, you could buy either of
[SPEAKER_00]: these for a little bit more and they're
simple to use, a single number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are the sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call an instrument means a sensor
connected to a meter and now I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: review the two types of meters that Apogee
sells because it's a package for many many
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee has sold this classic meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the on button right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't be simpler to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grab it, you push on button.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does record but it's not very
elegant for recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly people use it for
instantaneous measurements and MQ means
[SPEAKER_00]: meter quantum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the meter quantum with 610 and
the meter quantum with 620.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the classic package.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make the jump to light speed with this,
about a year ago Apogee introduced a micro
[SPEAKER_00]: cache with Bluetooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the same sensors plug into this and
it records data for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: over a year, but it also displays the data
to your phone with the Apogee app that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to the lab, I'm old school,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to make a quick
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab this meter because it has one on
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: My students laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, give it to program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get your phone out and look at all
the data you can collect so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the students, if this meter is sitting
on the counter, they say, where's the
[SPEAKER_00]: micro cache?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can put that in a growth chamber,
close the door and measure what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I get to run the cable through the
door and it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an up and coming instrument
because of the ability to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows both instantaneous and long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one here, little micro cache.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't plan to show it with my phone,
but there's some of the histograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the power far sensor and here's the
new sensor in a silver housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell the sensors apart because of
their colors, distinctive colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the end of the section on the new
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just review this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to go into why it's
important to measure these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to review, the old classic is
extended.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets this radiation out in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The improvement to that really is this
ePAR sensor, model 610.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go to the next one, the PAR far
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So red and far red separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can afford it, this is a great
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one doesn't work with a meter,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got two outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a single meter, you have to use this
with the micro cache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the options for the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to talk about why we want to
measure these different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much longer part of this talk,
but you can skip around in the video to
[SPEAKER_00]: the parts you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call this towards an optimal
spectral quality for plant growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the name of textbooks,
but when we say plant growth, we really
[SPEAKER_00]: mean direct effects on photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry weight of the plant gets bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say development, we mean plant
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant, tall spindly, short fat,
we can manipulate shape with quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, and we want to know how the quality
of light affects photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants sometimes get big because we change
their leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can make a bigger leaf with light
quality, it captures more light,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the photosynthesis per unit leaf area
is really the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a tricky thing, and I keep
coming back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant growth and development,
photosynthesis and shape or morphology of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very significant because in my
laboratory at Utah State University,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have been working on these two
parameters full-time to get them right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shuyang Zhen and I have published two
papers just in the last year on this exact
[SPEAKER_00]: topic, and this is primarily on the
effects of wavelengths of light on
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in these two papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put these in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in Plant Cell and Environment and
Frontiers in Plant Science, two of our
[SPEAKER_00]: most prestigious high-impact journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have long titles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause this and look at the titles
or just search on Zhen and Bugbee and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find the papers will come right up
in Google Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are on effects of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This science is what led to the EPAR
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see the need for a sensor based
on this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Shuyang Zhen, and I'm very pleased
to announce that she has now accepted a
[SPEAKER_00]: position as an assistant professor at
Texas A&M University.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to be continuing this work
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting work because it
fundamentally changes the definition of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't have done this work without
funding from both NASA and the USDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to acknowledge their help.
[SPEAKER_00]: For NASA, we're growing plants on Mars and
a colony on Mars, and for USDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the LAMP project, Lighting
Approaches to Maximize Profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very applied, focused project for
greenhouses and growth chambers on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very grateful to have this funding
to be able to do this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's take a closer look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to change the definition of
photosynthetic radiation, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: for years and years 400 to 700 nanometers,
we make students memorize those numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the wavelengths of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to put this in yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 to 750, another 50 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this quote from Carl Sagan in
Cosmos, extraordinary claims require
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extraordinary claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to change this definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old sensors aren't going to capture
that radiation, so here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two slides into the weeds on the
biochemistry of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just an experimental
measurement, it's supplemented with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of detailed theoretical considerations,
and I'll walk you through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gorgeous slide made by my
colleague, Mark Van Yersel, who is a
[SPEAKER_00]: professor at the University of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shuyang Zhen, by the way, got her PhD with
Mark working on this stuff, and then she
[SPEAKER_00]: came to my lab as a postdoc, and now she's
a professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out of Molecular Cell Biology 6th
edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a textbook, but Mark has annotated
this with what happens to a photon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a wonderful little animation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here comes a photon, boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits, it's absorbed, it's a reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here, electron, boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: That excites the electron, moves up to a
higher excitation level, then more photons
[SPEAKER_00]: come, hits absorption site over here,
and that then moves that electron,
[SPEAKER_00]: boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way up to there, all the way from
the sun to here, to here, to here,
[SPEAKER_00]: to here, out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called the light reactions of
photosynthesis, and those reactions make
[SPEAKER_00]: adenosine, triphosphate, and NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the light reactions of
photosynthesis, and if you can answer that
[SPEAKER_00]: on a test, you're ready to graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a detailed light reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is a lot of biochemistry,
and I really like physics more than
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry, so I made a different diagram,
and you can be the judge of which one's
[SPEAKER_00]: more easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from Albert Einstein and the
Stark-Einstein law, one photon excites one
[SPEAKER_00]: electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Mark's diagram just showed us,
but now I've got workers on towers more
[SPEAKER_00]: than the biochemistry of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the sun, so we're going to show the
sun here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as the other one, the sun is always
smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photons come in, boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy hits this platform with the
hammer, the electron goes up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: another worker catches it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that there's male workers here and
female workers doing the skilled positions
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it in here, it turns a mill,
and it makes ATP, the energy for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another photon comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's coming in this way,
boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: Sends it up here, another worker puts it
in a bucket, and we get NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called photosystem 2 and
photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew what one first, that's why they're
backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two happens before one, but it takes
photons from both sides to do this to
[SPEAKER_00]: fully excite all the electrons for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have known for over 50 years that
this worker right here can be excited with
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red photons above 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see if this guy was the only
one that was excited, this system wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work because you've got to have this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have him going up here,
and then he does the second jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is synergism, and we've tried with
far-red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does nothing, and we say, well,
that's no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to have visible light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we apply them both at the same time
together, this guy is excited,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one is excited, and the whole system
is more synergistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shu Young worked on this in Georgia and
showed that there was less heat produced
[SPEAKER_00]: when she gave plants far-red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she came to Utah, we started this is
called the Emerson enhancement effect
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was shown by Emerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazingly enough, in the 1950s,
when Emerson, then he was tragically
[SPEAKER_00]: killed in a crash of a small plane,
and no one ever followed up his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing story in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Shu Young comes along, and we start
doing canopy photosynthesis, whole
[SPEAKER_00]: canopies of plants in a closed box,
you can measure photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get this classic curve with 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was with lettuce now, and it starts
here at zero, goes up like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three points in this curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we gave them far-red light,
photosynthesis went up, but right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't counting it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't count those photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, but it made photosynthesis go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different levels, went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what Shu Young did, graph this 400 to
750 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: She counted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is, and look, all the data follows
one nice smooth curve because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: counting all the photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got these experimental results,
we went, wow, this is beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so far, we've only showed it in
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about other crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shu Young did 17 crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinach, basil, kale, sunflower,
corn, you can see them all on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a picture of the plants in the
chambers, one at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make a long story short, every crop did
the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this effect of far-red photons is
universal for many kinds of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This led to what I'd like to say is going
to become a lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a landmark publication in Plant
Cell and Environment from this work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we kept going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second paper, which is now published
in Frontiers and Plant Science,
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at what we call quantum yield over
the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this was like several weeks of a
lettuce crop, and quantum yield is,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have it right here, moles of carbon
fixed per mole of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very precise measurement of
photosynthetic efficiency, and here's 350
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that this one had 350, this one only
had 300, so this one should have been much
[SPEAKER_00]: less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we added 50 of far-red, so the sum of
these two is the same, and the quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, this was with, RB is a red-blue
background, like purple light,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was the same with purple light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also did the same thing with white
light, 350 and 300 plus 50, and the lines
[SPEAKER_00]: are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's compelling evidence that far-red
photons are equally good to traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photons, and that's the
underlying reason we need a sensor that
[SPEAKER_00]: includes them, particularly for LEDs,
because all those LEDs have far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: photons now, and we need to measure them,
so that EPAR sensor includes these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's the classic, there's the new,
750, the EPAR sensor, if you look at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: includes some photons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are UV photons, and now I'm going to
briefly talk about what UV does,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to base it both on McCree's
data and our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, Keith McCree, he's a wonderful
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a young scientist, I had a chance to
meet him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Bruce, what are you working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him.
[SPEAKER_00]: First he said, Bruce, what's the most
important question in your discipline?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, yeah, it's probably this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, what are you working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him, and he says, why aren't
you working on the most important thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: your discipline?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back to the lab, get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, he gave us this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're adding on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a sharp cut-off, right at 400?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly important because now
we have LEDs right in this region,
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you these LEDs and show
you why this end is also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's four colors of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put this one in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one we call violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the names on here,
but violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Violet is really quite an efficient LED
and it's right on the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here, we call it UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at this, a big part of that
sensor is really UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do these cause photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these efficient over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor is just inside of UV
radiation, but 2.22 micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an efficient LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this does unique things, we need to be
putting this in fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three are primarily UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, though, has a tail in the
visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is why we need to know exactly
what's going on right here with
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65% efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: 58%, 57%, 49%.
[SPEAKER_00]: These become less efficient, but if they
have unique effects, we need to be using
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is becoming increasingly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three are still emerging
possibilities, but if we can show they
[SPEAKER_00]: help, fixture manufacturers will use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the same graph just shown on a
bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is UVC down here, which we're also
studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very damaging, but you just give
trace amounts and it has the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: do good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peak heights are proportional to their
efficiencies or their efficacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the standard blue right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 450 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: White LEDs start from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very common in all fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the violet right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put V for violet and then three
wavelengths of UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they do to plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's McCree's curve that everybody shows
this and we look at it over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we just talked about, shown in red,
is this curve right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now got compelling evidence that we
need to shift this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about this end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the tail on this end and compare
it to those three LED curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a deeper dive into McCree's
original papers on this to look at what
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthesis looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph we made from McCree's data
and here is 400 nanometers right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plants from the field and they
sparingly used that UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth chamber plants used the UV
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to think this was because they
weren't used to UV and they didn't filter
[SPEAKER_00]: it out and they used it all the time,
but on closer inspection of his data,
[SPEAKER_00]: coupled with our own data of measurements
of plants, now we know it was just chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have used different species here in
the growth chamber and the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't because they were grown in the
growth chamber, they just used different
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the UV that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the big error bars in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fascinating area of study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce and cucumber, both two high-value
common species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 400 right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumber minimally uses UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce uses a lot of UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more effectively uses those UV
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show you all the other crops we've
studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunflowers is actually pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunflowers, you'd think they were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species are even more out here,
but there's a big range of curves in the
[SPEAKER_00]: UV among species.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more summary slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the old data from McCree,
where it cuts off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new sensor comes out here,
comes across at one, all the way across,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it doesn't have a sharp cutoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It counts some of these UV photons,
has a tapering response there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big advantage is a little bit of UV
right here and a bunch of far red there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ePAR sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to close with a slide that
summarizes all the types of light on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue photons inhibit cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make plants small and compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green photons, they're fine for
photosynthesis, but they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: important for human vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have green photons, you can see the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red photons are terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficient photosynthesis, our fixtures
have a lot of red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far red photons do the opposite of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This inhibits cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These promote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we go into the future, we're going to
be going back and forth, between
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibiting and enhancing cell expansion
with these colors of light to shape the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with photobiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens to be cannabis, 5% blue,
20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shrunk the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else was identical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, a nice compact plant is a good
thing, but this plant is also a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: wider than that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It captures more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we could put far red, if I do that in
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put far red in here, this is going
to look just like that with more blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating ability to manipulate
plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human vision, you can see the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's far red light and lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tremendously valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% far red leaf expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really valuable for lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the far red light makes
most plants significantly taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be very careful how we use it
because it can easily make tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny plants instead of short,
compact plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all in front of us, manipulating
far red, putting it on at the right place
[SPEAKER_00]: and the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the right crop, but it's a very
powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That new EPAR sensor now measures it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you again in another video.
