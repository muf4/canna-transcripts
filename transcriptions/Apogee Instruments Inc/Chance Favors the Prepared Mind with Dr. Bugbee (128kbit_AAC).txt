[SPEAKER_00]: So today I want to share a talk with you
that I recently did at the annual meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: of the American Society of Agronomy,
which was in Baltimore, Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked by the society to give a talk
on serendipity in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How things, how we, accidental discoveries
in science and how they impact our
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course my media thought when they
asked me to give a talk about serendipity
[SPEAKER_00]: in sciences, so what do you, would you
think my whole career was just based on
[SPEAKER_00]: luck?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm here talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they said, no, no, no, we don't think
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've had some significant
discoveries and we'd like you to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about how those came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to talk title my talk,
Chance Favors the Prepared Mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always loved this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first read it when I was in graduate
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I want to dedicate my career
to having a prepared mind so when those
[SPEAKER_00]: chances come along, they're a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this seems to make pretty intuitive
sense, but what's a prepared mind really
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, an analogy that I thought of is
what if we said, chance favors the
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that would make perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Athletes spend a long time preparing their
minds and bodies for that one catch and
[SPEAKER_00]: some great game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't luck, that was a lot of
skill honed by years of practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same principles relate to this with
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prepared mind means learning all the
principles of your discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equations that make up your
discipline, the theory, the models,
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature in your discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means really becoming a true expert in
your discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what prepared mind means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you come along and see the
odd things, you're prepared to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hmm, that could be something right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you follow it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lesser people might say, now that was a
bad day to just forget it and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this quote came from Louis Pasteur.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great philanthropist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germ theory of disease came from
Pasteur.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was always working with sterile
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing stories of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he wrote about this, he got the
Nobel Prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he wrote about this, he didn't have
five succinct words to describe this
[SPEAKER_00]: principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what he wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even before I get to what he wrote,
let's take a look at what a prepared mind
[SPEAKER_00]: might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some data, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an X plot, an input variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Y, a plant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get data like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we would normally, say the data's
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a common principle for a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you give X, this is nonlinear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make measurements, you get this point
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first inclination is, that must be
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you measured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can get back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You measured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have statistical principles that say,
this is so far off the line, just forget
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an example of something that
might be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take this out here for a second,
that little line right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna go back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people might take this,
and they have a high-speed computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll attempt to fit this with a
10th order polynomial that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you gotta come up with the
principle that says, right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a big inhibitory effect of X on Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just that simple data set alone gives
you a lot of examples of the challenges we
[SPEAKER_00]: go through, and we make good measurements,
very careful measurements, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: sorting good data from bad data and
looking for those anomalies that lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: great breakthroughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Past year, didn't say these five concise
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what he originally wrote for his
Nobel Prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fields of observation, chance favors
the prepared mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true in all fields, not just in
observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chance favors only the prepared mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, we don't need the word
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We edit that out, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get to his quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So past year, like a lot of people,
had good editors as stuff to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: concise statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of science, the
conciseness that leads to new
[SPEAKER_00]: breakthroughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we often think scientists must say when
they have a breakthrough, they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, Eureka, I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really not how science works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You rarely get to something you expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common phrase is, hmm,
that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part that leads to these
great breakthroughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from Isaac Asimov, this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a book that I've had on my
shelf for years, Serendipity, Accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: Discoveries in Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is loaded with examples of
unhappy accidents that occurred in
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still in print.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a deeper look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1963, Science Magazine had an
editorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the conclusion of the editorial was,
Serendipity is not a substitute for hard
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a gold standard in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were being criticized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just fund the scientists that
are lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not lucky scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ones that have hard work,
and they have prepared minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were pushing back on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an old phrase, the harder I work,
the luckier I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look, hard work is in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work is in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work is something you don't like doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do a lot of it and feel
good about it and be creative,
[SPEAKER_00]: you gotta do the stuff you like doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to like what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always say just, this isn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work is something I don't enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the keys to doing a lot of
something and then being able to pick out
[SPEAKER_00]: the happy accidents that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another big thing about statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistics is not gonna lead us to great
breakthroughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps us determine mathematical
probabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your experiment needs statistics,
you ought to have done a better
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from Ernest Rutherford,
Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can believe he wanted clean
experiments where he didn't need a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: reps and he didn't need a lot of
statistics to sort out his results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly in our research here,
we try to do simple, clean experiments so
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't need a lot of replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next section of this talk is about
this intersection between theory and
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get to a point right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge is really the extent to which
theory agrees with measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now theory is another term for models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And models are equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if models predict something and that's
what we measure, we get confident that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in this room up here on a board by
our clock to keep people thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really this quote in here says,
never believe a measurement unless it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be substantiated with theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conversely, the degree of confidence
we can have is the degree to which these
[SPEAKER_00]: two things agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theory is what you learn in school,
theory is what prepares your mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: and measurement's what you do in the lab
and you look for when they converge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to pick out these serendipitous
measurements, we need wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a three-way interaction between
all three of those things that gets us
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another quote that's just
striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody believes a measurement except
the person that made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the person that made it knows how hard
it was to make that measurement and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not sure they got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody else thinks, oh no,
no, it's measured, it's fine, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corollary to this is nobody believes a
model except the person who made the
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the modelers are always saying,
I have a model, I have a model,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, it's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line of this, we should
believe measurements less and we should
[SPEAKER_00]: believe models more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put equal weight on both of these to
guide us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the place where I think much of this
came from is back to the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're making a lot of measurements
to go into the future and they make a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of models back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice corollary to this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see, we get this off the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The analogy I have used to emphasize this
link between theory and measurement is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to the top of a house with two
ladders and the rules of science say you
[SPEAKER_00]: can only have one foot on each ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one ladder is measurement,
one ladder is theory, and you get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the house fastest when you put one
foot on one rung and back and forth and
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth and up you go on the
ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tried to do only measurements,
you maybe could get there hopping on one
[SPEAKER_00]: foot on the ladder, but it'd be awfully
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only theory hopping on one foot would
be awfully hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another part of this is if you wanna
be really safe, you should tie your
[SPEAKER_00]: ladders together so that the whole thing
is more safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good because we wanna link
theory and measurement intimately back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some examples of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's theory, there's measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take these off of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back and forth, back and forth,
and here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In, up, up, up, up, out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, they're far apart and this takes
a while to get up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we more intimately link them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have faster progress because
they're closer together back and forth and
[SPEAKER_00]: then finally they become one and the same,
in the same person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theory, measurement, evaluate,
that makes for excellent progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna further emphasize this with some
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albert Einstein, all he ever needed to do
research was a box of chalk and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to be his department head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be needing another box of chalk this
year for my research budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do all kinds of empirical replicates in
the field that look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theory and measurement excellence emerges
from continuous coupling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move these together, it's continuously
coupled and we make faster progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort out the bad data from the good and
we improve our models by doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often in research, we get this out of
balance and we do a lot of empirical
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements and we have very inadequate
theory to explain them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some labs, the reverse is true and we
have a lot of theory but not very much
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This often happens in climate science
where we have a lot of models.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rely heavily on models and just a
little bit of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in both of these cases, it's out of
balance and it doesn't lead to the fastest
[SPEAKER_00]: progress in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's switch to a little bit of data
that we have here in our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph of colors of light at
night and how they affect flowering in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always say a green light is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna work at night, always use
green light because that has no effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use red or blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is days after start and flower
diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the steeper the line, the faster the
plants flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they were completely dark,
they flowered fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we gave them blue light, and I can show
that in blue on here, they flowered
[SPEAKER_00]: equally fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this study, blue light was safe,
no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red light's the opposite of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering was inhibited by red light right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flower diameters were smaller
because the plants perceived red light at
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the point, look at the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green in this study was just effective as
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the case that green light is a
safe light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants perceived the green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: If plants reflect green light,
how can that be so potent?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we think it's safe,
because they just reflect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put up here a diagram of how
well light penetrates plant leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light is reflected, but that also
means it penetrates deeper into leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a diagram of the cross section of
a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the top of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bottom of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this distance is just like one
millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue and green are absorbed very quickly
in the surface layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green photons hit, and they bounce
around, and they penetrate the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means the green photons get to
the site of perception of the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in this case is the phytochrome
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though those photons don't have
such a big effect, they're not zero,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're getting to the site of
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this only came from our understanding
of principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, well, this can't be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw the green light data out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it led to a new principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the paper that resulted from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improving the predictive value of
phytochrome photoequilibrium in
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration of spectral distortion in a
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this data led to this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, having said this, green light is
still the best light to use, because our
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes are really sensitive to green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use green light if you have to work at
night, but try to use a minimal amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not completely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is weighing lysimeters in our
greenhouse and go back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are load cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weigh plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure transpiration with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a growth chamber, and this is
cotton on these, and corn on these
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can make very accurate measurements
of how open the stomates are and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is day and night, two days,
transpiration rate, which is right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is, and let's see if I can show
this in purple, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's low at night, not zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's zero right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: High in the day, low at night,
high in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our measurements, just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomodal conductance, that's how open the
stomates are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's shown in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomates open in the day and close at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look, they're not completely closed at
night, and this number right here is about
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.4 open, and wide open in the day is
about 0.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this data, the stomates are about
half as open at night as they are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason this is higher than this is
it's very humid at night, and the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: are cooler so that transpiration should be
much less because there's not much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: driving gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conductance is the ratio of driving
gradient to transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this data was collected some years
ago in cotton, but we know this also
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in cannabis, which is a very big
deal because we have a lot of flux of
[SPEAKER_00]: water at night when the stomates are
supposed to be closed, and they're open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to run dehumidifiers or we get
plant disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the textbooks say, stomates close at
night, and that sentence in textbooks is
[SPEAKER_00]: just wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except if we give the plants some water
stress, a minor water stress, they quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: start to close their stomates at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same data, had we stressed these
plants a little bit with water,
[SPEAKER_00]: now the conductance would be down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if plants, like many of our cannabis,
if they're grown with no water stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't close their stomates at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big, big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in electric lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of these lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in electric lights, and I'm going
to have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights in this were a square wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came on and looked like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an electric light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our principles say that
transpiration rate should follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should go up and high and come down,
and instead it's a curve in here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it happened every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been a square.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a curve in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our models don't predict that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The measurements in here didn't match the
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got this data, we very quickly
went to multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go right here and looked at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a square wave of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All plants do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the afternoon, it's like they get
tired, and this is transpiration rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: or this is stomatal conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to close their stomates in the
afternoon, and they don't even open them
[SPEAKER_00]: until about 11 o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just remarkable that plants do this,
and it took controlled environments to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to study this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lines are close to zero down here
because the plants got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has big implications for designing
air conditioning systems and humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: disease control.
[SPEAKER_00]: These stomates are wide open in the middle
one-third of the day, but it takes them a
[SPEAKER_00]: few hours to get there, and they close
their stomates for a few hours in the
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go back to another fascinating
thing about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a well-watered cotton plant and a
two-water stress cotton plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This same thing happens in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a long time to open, and then they
started to gradually close.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's night right there, but look at
these drought-stressed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also take a while to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay open, maybe about half.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a measurement of how
drought-stressed they are, but look what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant is cycling for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opens its stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we overshot, and it closed them and
opened, closed, opened, and closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this repeatedly in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is anomalous data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of data you go,
huh, that's funny, and then you find out
[SPEAKER_00]: you can repeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has big implications for design of
controlled environments where we spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of money taking the humidity out of
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: These.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lines are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move to another huge area for us
here in the crop physiology lab and my
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just barely see far-red right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call these the forgotten photons
because they're on the edge of our vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can barely see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of work with far-red
photons and their photosynthetic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work was done with my long-term
colleagues Mark Van Ersel at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was here last summer with us,
recorded videos with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just been a joy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now got an endowed chair position at
the University of Georgia and Shu-Yang
[SPEAKER_00]: Zhen, who is a very talented scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got her PhD with Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she came to Utah to work with me for
a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is now an assistant professor at Texas
A&M University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together the three of us have published
six, seven papers on this and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: review this evidence because it has the
potential to be a profound implications
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: No far-red and 10% of the photons is
far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't have to be a rocket
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be a rocket scientist to
see those far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing amazing things to this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this is due to what we call a
shade avoidance response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're in shade, so they just
spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread their leaves bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known that forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: With careful measurements of
photosynthesis, we have shown that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this profound effect is also due to
far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big deal because for years and
years we've said far-red photons do not
[SPEAKER_00]: cause photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an amazing claim to say they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have amazing claims, we should
always fall back on this mantra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary
proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was popularized by Carl Sagan in
Cosmos but this is an old saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what I want to do is show you the
extraordinary proof for far-red and
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very concise summary but this
started in 2017 with Journal of Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark and Shuyang in Georgia studied the
light reactions of photosynthesis and very
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly showed these far-red photons had a
beneficial effect They followed it up with
[SPEAKER_00]: laser diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year later published another paper,
Physiologica Plantarum, showing that the
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths of far-red up to about 730
nanometers were clearly helpful in the
[SPEAKER_00]: light reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that Shuyang came here to our
lab in Utah where we have a whole series
[SPEAKER_00]: of whole plant gas exchange chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can measure photosynthesis on whole
canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shuyang and I published a paper in 2020 in
Plant Cell and Environment, one of our top
[SPEAKER_00]: journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far-red photons have equivalent efficiency
to traditional photosynthetic photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: implications for redefining PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR is Photosynthetically Active
Radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept working on this in longer-term
whole plant studies, published a paper on
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red photons in Frontiers and Plant
Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yet more accumulating evidence,
more papers, and now our colleagues are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into this and there's other papers
from other laboratories showing far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: photons have photosynthetic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that all these papers are pretty
recent papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's one thing that's critical here
and that's the mechanism for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my diagram of how the light
reactions of photosynthesis work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stark Einstein law says one photon
excites one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how solar panels work,
this is how photosynthesis work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A photon comes in, excites this guy,
this electron gets excited, and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: passed down this mill, this turns,
it makes ATP, makes energy, another photon
[SPEAKER_00]: hits this guy, boom, another electron's
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a two-stage process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosystem two comes first and
photosystem one comes second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because we discovered this first
and then we later found out there's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water gets split right here to oxygen,
but here's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have known for a long time that far-red
photons excite this photoreceptor in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosystem one, and that is called the
Emerson enhancement effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been known for 50 years, but it's
been little studied until now when we got
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red LEDs, we can do more rigorous
studies of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause this and look at this
diagram, but this is electron transport in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, but simplified to show
electrons getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes four photons here and four
photons here, either classic or far-red,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it takes eight photons to get through
the whole thing and fix CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have extended this now to plants in
sunlight, not just electric light,
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight, and very recently, July 2020,
we published a paper, photosynthesis in
[SPEAKER_00]: sun and shade, surprising importance of
far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This extends the work to sunlight,
and New Phytologists is one of our top
[SPEAKER_00]: journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope that this will help people
understand the value of far-red light,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a very big deal in the world of
cannabis because far-red photons are very
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're long wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very photosynthetically efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the classic McCree curve for
photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our definitions, it cuts it off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These photons are not very many,
and this curve is pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drop pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, we got 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the classic definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we add this recent work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This curve has a bulge over here,
so it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old definition is called PAR,
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new definition is called EPAR,
extended photosynthetically active
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee makes a sensor to measure EPAR,
and it's a better predictor of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis than the old PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to close here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a diagram done by a Utah artist,
James Christensen, and I just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we do in science to get
serendipitous discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take our equipment out, and sometimes
our labs look like a bad day in a
[SPEAKER_00]: spaghetti factory around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take it out for a drive and test it and
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to know how to get
serendipity in science, build equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: homemade, doesn't cost much, and take it
out for a drive and see what happens and
[SPEAKER_00]: be prepared for anomalous findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this inspires you to go on and make
a lot of measurements in science.
Thank you.
