[SPEAKER_00]: This is the user guide for the Apogee
Guardian.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee Guardian is an all-in-one
greenhouse monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Guardian features five different
sensors providing nine different metrics
[SPEAKER_00]: and gives you the option to access them
using one app.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee Guardian comes in two different
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SM500 which features a PAR sensor and
the SM600 which features an EPAR sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire shroud is an aspirated shield
for the temperature sensor which you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Guardian will take air and pull it up
through the housing past the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor and then disperse that air out the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom of the Guardian is held on by
magnets and when removed will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: access to the humidity the CO2 and the
pressure sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put the bottom back on line it up and
should snap right it back on because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: held on by magnets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the Guardian is
waterproof from falling rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray water up into the
unit because it could damage the
[SPEAKER_00]: components of the Guardian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the Guardian case it comes with a
wire hanging kit and a power adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: To power on the Guardian pull the
connector from the housing, line up the
[SPEAKER_00]: pins, connect the connector and finger
tighten the metal rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then add power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that when you power on the
Guardian the bottom is free and clear from
[SPEAKER_00]: any obstructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the air can freely flow through
the device and it won't overstress the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Guardian is powered on but is not
collecting any data.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take data you need to either use the
Modbus protocol or use the Bluetooth
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Connect app.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use the wire hanging kit first locate
the wire kit hanging connection points.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the clip, line it up from the bottom
and push up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make a popping sound as it connects
into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that for all three sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should look something like this when
you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang it from the hook or loop and
then connect to the hanging kit itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: To remove the hanging kit pull the clips
outward and they should pop right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available for the Guardian is the
multi-position mast mount.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mast mount features a U-bolt that
allows you to mount to various sizes of
[SPEAKER_00]: masts.
[SPEAKER_00]: First tighten the U-bolt onto the mast
mount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orient the clip so that the bubble level
is facing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotate the knob clockwise to increase
tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've found the appropriate tension
pull the connector away from the Guardian
[SPEAKER_00]: and hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the mount push the top clip down to
lock it into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the bubble level on top to orient the
Guardian in a horizontal position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply connect power and you're ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: To remove the Guardian from the mast mount
take the clip on the back side push
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the Guardian and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The retaining clip on the top should lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point you can lift and pull away
the Guardian.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Guardian mounted and powered on
you're ready to begin taking measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use the Modbus protocol look at the
user manual below in the description for
[SPEAKER_00]: details on how to set up using Modbus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm going to show you how to use
the Apogee Connect app.
[SPEAKER_00]: First you need to install the Apogee
Connect app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the Connect app at the iTunes
store or at Google Play.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open the software it'll look
similar to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine has several sensors already
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours will probably be blank but to add a
sensor go to the plus sign up in the top
[SPEAKER_00]: left corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll begin searching for devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the device and click on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's connected you can then change
the name of that device.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to change this to SM 500 demo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hit add.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's added you can scroll down and
see that it's connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to disconnect the device press
and hold and swipe from the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll give you the option to forget or to
disconnect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to realign where your sensors
are on the list press and hold and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: slide them up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the home screen it'll give you a quick
overview of the device's measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at those measurements in
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here it'll show you the readings as
well as what logs are available to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time setting up the
device click on the settings icon to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up your device.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here you can either set up custom
calibrations, dark offsets and enable
[SPEAKER_00]: logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we do that so click
on the little toggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here you can set how often you want
to take your samples and how often you
[SPEAKER_00]: want them to be logged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to change our sampling
interval to every 10 seconds and then log
[SPEAKER_00]: them every minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're done press the save button.
[SPEAKER_00]: The device is now logging data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below you'll see the notify when full
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enable this if you'd like to receive a
notification when the memory on the
[SPEAKER_00]: guardian is almost full.
[SPEAKER_00]: After some time there'll be some data
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: To collect that data press the collect
logs button.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here you have the option to create a
new data set or to add to an old data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to create a new data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call it data set demo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click in the bottom right corner under
collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will begin to download that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how much data you have to
collect it may take a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've collected that data you can
scroll down to see those metrics displayed
[SPEAKER_00]: in graph form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see things like the DLI,
photo periods, PAR, temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the metrics that the guardian measures
will be there in display form.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the icons below you have the option to
switch your data set, export your data
[SPEAKER_00]: set, and delete data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also has the option for a live meter
mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the live meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will instantly begin to show you real
time data of what the guardian is
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it takes samples it will begin to
display in the graph form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that you should have what you
need to get started with the guardian.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't any questions please feel
free to leave a comment in the comment
[SPEAKER_00]: section below or refer to the user manual
found in the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and have a
wonderful day.
Bye for now.
