[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the president of Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started Apogee in my garage a long time
ago and I am currently also a professor
[SPEAKER_00]: right up here at Utah State University for
those of you who don't know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is plant physiology and I
teach plant physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also teach a course in environmental
instrumentation at the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all graduate level classes for
students aspiring to get good at what you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are already good at and I tell them
if you can get good at this people will
[SPEAKER_00]: come because your services will be in
great demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a background for my class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always divide that into three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of instrumentation is having some
understanding of what we call the physics
[SPEAKER_00]: of signal transduction and that means how
does some sensor out there convert wind
[SPEAKER_00]: into an electrical signal for a data
logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it convert temperature,
anything, into an electrical signal and
[SPEAKER_00]: when students have a better understanding
of that they can far better diagnose their
[SPEAKER_00]: systems to understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second part of it is interfacing sensors
to data loggers and Campbell Scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: every year very graciously donates a whole
set of data loggers for this class and so
[SPEAKER_00]: they get trained on Campbell's loggers,
interfacing them, stuff like voltage
[SPEAKER_00]: dividers and hooking them up and then the
third part is programming the data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a popular class and it's too bad
people don't teach classes like this more
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think increasingly we see just
give me the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's high quality data and there's low
quality data and if you don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference you're about to make bad models
and a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get to this in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd start, there's so much stuff
we can talk about in a class like this and
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some really knowledgeable people in
the audience so we can have some exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: and instead of me lecturing we can have
some exchange of information and obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: if you teach a whole semester class in
this no way you can condense that into 60
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just hit some highlights of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I welcome your comments and questions
as we go along in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we get asked a lot
at Apogee is how do you decide on what new
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors to work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually people say could you make a sensor
to measure this and the answer is always
[SPEAKER_00]: yes but then our question is of course how
many would you buy if we made that and
[SPEAKER_00]: well I'd buy one and both of my buddies
would buy one and you should make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it really comes down to is an
estimate of the worldwide size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market for some new sensors and sometimes
it's an improvement on an old sensor and
[SPEAKER_00]: how much R&D would it take to make the
first one and both of those are broad
[SPEAKER_00]: guesses and anybody affiliated with
instrument companies goes through the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and you hope that the market will be
as big as you hope for and the R&D won't
[SPEAKER_00]: be too much worse than you think and off
you go into a new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: As companies get bigger and as Apogee has
gotten bigger we can undertake more
[SPEAKER_00]: ambitious projects and one of them that
you're going to see in the hallway,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not necessarily going to talk about it
here, one of them is our new weighing
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation gauge and we had the great
fortune of the Bureau of Land Management
[SPEAKER_00]: came to us and they said could you make an
improved gauge and I'd been working with
[SPEAKER_00]: load cells in my laboratory at the
university for lysimeters to weigh plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and I thought how hard can that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to measure stuff with load
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that was over three years ago and
we're still polishing the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The R&D for that has been a lot more than
we anticipated but the market is even
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger than we anticipated too so that's
been an emerging cutting-edge thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee is of course primarily a sensor
company and we started out making
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first product was called a
quantum sensor which measures photons for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis because that's right out of
my background and at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is 20-some years ago, the only one
that was really widely used whether it was
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky Instruments in the UK and Lycor in the
United States and I think back then Kipp
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sonnen might have had one,
I can't remember when theirs exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: started but all of those were quite
expensive and we realized if we could just
[SPEAKER_00]: take a simple photodiode and hook it up to
a voltmeter and we would have an adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum sensor and in fact this morning I
went to the antique instrument collection
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have some glass cases down at
Apogee now where I've been able to display
[SPEAKER_00]: my antique instruments which I just love
and as the word is spread, people retire
[SPEAKER_00]: at universities and a couple people have
bequeathed their instrument collection to
[SPEAKER_00]: us so we're getting better antique
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first product Apogee ever
built and it says quantum meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum is a mole of photons and the
sensors in the top and look what it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from, just a low-cost voltmeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have big startup costs and we
just took it apart and modified the
[SPEAKER_00]: voltmeter and made this first sensor and
it still works and it's in the museum now
[SPEAKER_00]: but we built it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept upgrading this and spread out to
other projects but because the cost was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't do anything another meter didn't
do, it's just that it was cheaper and it
[SPEAKER_00]: helped a lot of people and we started the
company to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another thing that I grabbed out of
the antique instrument collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first cell phone, the pop-up
antenna and man we thought this was such a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the museum now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a chance it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like instruments and like old
instruments it's fun to go down memory
[SPEAKER_00]: lane and see all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I'd like to start with first
is just the simplest measurement of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and the simplest measurement
of air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got involved with this because one of
the big selling products for Apogee is an
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared radiation radiometer to get
surface temperatures and it's one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: more expensive instruments, a high-end
instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good at getting surface
temperatures but what we always really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to know to determine energy balance
in plant canopies and irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements of crops is the leaf to air
temperature difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is environmental science 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need leaf temperature, you need air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we realized was the air temperatures
were wrong when they were measured in a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard multi-plate static shield and
they're wrong because the sun shines on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shield, heats it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the wind is not blowing fast enough it
reads high and we've always known they
[SPEAKER_00]: read high but I'll show you some data
about how big that error can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world record for the error of a static
shield, we have a station at Peter Sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have a slide on Peter Sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big bowl, low, cold air pools in
there and we have measured the second
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest temperature in the continental
United States here at Peter Sinks for our
[SPEAKER_00]: climate center group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show you some data that in a minute
but there's snow in the ground up there
[SPEAKER_00]: and really cold so we need precision
measurements of temperature to a tenth of
[SPEAKER_00]: a degree C.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a static shield up there and
an apogee aspirated shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not long ago we measured a 13.5 Celsius
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: The static shield was 13.5 Celsius warmer
than the apogee aspirated shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensors were precise sensors in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling that the new world record
for the error of a static shield but we
[SPEAKER_00]: often see one and two degrees C
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partly it's when there's snow in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snow reflects and it bounces up from
the bottom and it causes big errors in
[SPEAKER_00]: static shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just that simple measurement,
wow, that's the primary measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air temperature and the primary way we
measure it, and we have done for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, can have much bigger errors than we
realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sensor would you use to do measure
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermocouples, but we've primarily relied
on PRTs, platinum resistance thermometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get accurate measurements of air
temperature and these have been the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: standard for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're expensive and they're bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get this bigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I slide this back and make it bigger
without screwing everything up?
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be able to, maybe there's a cord
but if we can't, oh yeah, there you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this thing right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps, that's good, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, oh there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide, yeah thanks, let's turn those
off, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're, something we can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pretty fine print on this
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These slides are from a talk that I gave a
few years ago at the American Society of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agronomy had a special symposium on
emerging instruments, emerging trends in
[SPEAKER_00]: weather and we talked about temperature
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is thermistors versus PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first point in this measurement of
temperature is small is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've worked with that,
man we have used some very fine wire
[SPEAKER_00]: thermocouples to get accurate measurements
of temperature because they stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium with the air temperature
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay, there's a human hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could put a thermocouple in here and
they get pretty small down around human
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super fragile and hard to build
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can get fine wire thermistors quite
small now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thermistor is used in human and
animal physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can inject it into living organisms
inside of a syringe so they get
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for reference, there's a 24 gauge
thermocouple, then epoxy bead thermistor
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a pretty standard PRT and then a
thermistor at the bottom inside a ceramic
[SPEAKER_00]: sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge range of sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get bigger, they are less,
they do not stay in thermal equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: with the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about response time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the equilibrium temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big sensor absorbs more solar radiation
and it always warms above the air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature depending on the radiation and
the wind speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we measure radiation and
wind and back correct what the real
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature was and pretty soon you have
fudge factors in here and you'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: just have accurate sensors so you don't
have to have a lot of fudge factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a range of sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm pushing the button,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say PRTs, they are absolutely
not created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People act like they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I have a PRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what kind of a PRT?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the five main classes,
CBA, 1 3rd DIN, 1 10th DIN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a picture up there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the error specifications for these
PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1 10th DIN is a tremendous,
that's a wonderful sensor, but it's 15
[SPEAKER_00]: times as expensive as a Class C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes people are a little vague
about what PRTs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a PRT is in their instrument,
they just say it's a PRT, but you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what kind of a PRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big differences in PRTs and accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to talk about the
disadvantages of PRTs other than cost to
[SPEAKER_00]: get good accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is that epoxy bead thermistor up
there that was shown in the first slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small, generally smaller than most of the
PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the accuracy spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call a precision
thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, by the way, used for the
reference temperature and Campbell
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific data loggers inside the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good spec, 0.1 degree C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the relative cost is about 1x.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this slide for very
long, and PRTs are a very cost effective
[SPEAKER_00]: option for measuring temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, thermistors, provided it's the
right thermistor with the right specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a more expensive thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, historically, when I was in graduate
school, people were cycling thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the older faculty, then they would
buy them, and they'd temperature cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stabilizing it, because after I cycle
it enough, I find it stabilizes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I calibrate the thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermistors have come a long way in the
past several decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much more stable, and they have
much better accuracy standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some papers in the
literature with groups like NIST,
[SPEAKER_00]: reference groups, that now are starting to
use thermistors as reference standards for
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: PRTs are still, the expensive PRTs are
still the gold standard, but thermistors
[SPEAKER_00]: are much cheaper and getting really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this particular thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, let me make one point right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermistors can be less stable than a PRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason to go with a PRT,
because of long-term stability,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the reason thermistors drift,
there's two reasons they drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: High temperatures and moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: High temperatures means higher than 60
degrees C, so it's not, and that starts
[SPEAKER_00]: and they, so the high temperatures are
warmer than our environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, so it's not really a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they absorb moisture, the resistance
changes and they drift, and that can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to get thermistors accurate is
to encase them in a waterproof epoxy or
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in a waterproof epoxy,
and I'll show you some data on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of this sensor in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible to make thermistors very
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Campbell Scientific sells one
inside of a stainless steel sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's called the SS, I forget the
number, but inside a stainless steel it's
[SPEAKER_00]: encased, so it's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular one is not encased and
it's stable because it's epoxy coated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a key consideration with
thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now consider that all the PRTs are
resistant sensors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're encased in stainless steel to
keep moisture away from and keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one of the, the next slide shows
you a hidden cost of sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you work with these,
you start to get an appreciation for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many channels on a data logger does
your sensor take up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we have digital sensors and
evolving data loggers with digital data
[SPEAKER_00]: loggers, wow, digital sensors allow you to
put a lot of sensors on a smaller data
[SPEAKER_00]: logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The days in which we had big lots of
channels and multiplexers and CR7s,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a lot more digital sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at what a thermistor takes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is three and two, three and four wire
resistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure resistance with two wires,
which is the secondary instrument,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is off the internet, the secondary
instrument in this case would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: Campbell's logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets more accurate when you have a
third wire for a reference and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: three wire measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to achieve those tenth of a degree C
accuracies, you really ought to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: four wire measurement and a four wire
thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a more expensive thermistor because
there's more wires and it takes up four
[SPEAKER_00]: analog channels on the data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thermistors are, they're expensive from
the standpoint of channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course you can digitally measure
them and send a digital signal too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to show you now is that our
data collected over many cycles of
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerated aging tests to see how much
drift we could cause in these thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they drift, that's a big
problem we need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do accelerated aging, up and down
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a tray of water in the bottom of
the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they freeze and they get cold and then
they are high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very worst case scenario and we
cycle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular data set, 96 cycles
minus 20 to plus 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue lines are those yellow bead
thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red line is class A PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not the highest quality PRTs,
but you can see the offsets and this graph
[SPEAKER_00]: right here shows after we normalize it to
the initial temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those thermistors were more stable than
that class A PRT in this test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it provides evidence that thermistors
can be very stable over a long period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another even more rigorous test,
10 months, 584 cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now with high quality PRTs,
two-replicate PRTs, deviation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both very, very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-replicate thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the other data, but it's in
a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those thermistors were within,
once we got rid of the offset,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were within 0.05 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point is thermistors can be
impressively stable if they're encased
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example I talked about Peter
Sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example of what we do with Peter Sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big basin up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're sort of, if you don't have to
live here very long and you learn this
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1985, we measured minus 56.3 C at Peter
Sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the record low temperature for Utah
and the second coldest temperature ever
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded in the continental United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the first?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still going for that first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't got it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global warming's not helping us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coldest temperature ever measured was
minus 69.7 at Rogers Pass, Montana,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1954.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed it by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tenths of a degree Fahrenheit,
the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just love it if we got a super cold
winter and we could get that record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a lot of instruments up there to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of the station up there
with the bottom of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's where we have these two yellow
bead thermistors and two-replicate high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are inside of that aspirated shield
looking up from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some data in here on the
comparison of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been up there for several
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob, do you remember how long this has
been up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I don't know, five or eight years or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just replicant measurements inside an
aspirated shield to get perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're both tracking really closely
within a tenth of a degree C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the story on measuring
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're big fans of precision thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the Apogee aspirated shield
has this yellow bead thermistor inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: it for air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to talk about is the
importance of aspirated shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's one thing to have a good
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we mentioned a minute ago,
if you don't have it in the right housing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have an error from the
housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Sanford's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew, you've worked on this stuff your
whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any additional comments of
PRTs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I need to say that most neurological
services treat them as a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: They what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They treat them as a reference instrument.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can't break that model.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really know how to calibrate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to measure them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's good that you offer them
when you're a shield out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still are a reference instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as the reference instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible to make a bad PRT sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful if you're forgetting PRTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next series of slides is a separate
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to close this and open the
next talk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is slides from another talk that we
gave at another professional conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Blonquist, if you haven't already met
him, is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the chief scientist at Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Apogee, we don't decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have vice presidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have chiefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have chief scientists, chief operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief operating officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ryan Lindsay is a mechanical engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are slides about the performance of
an aspirated shield that Apogee has sold
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, which also took a lot longer
to develop and refine than we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has helped us understand the errors
that we are all getting when we use static
[SPEAKER_00]: shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's improvements in those,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some static shields are better
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the sun is shining and the wind's
not blowing, they're going to heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a little diagram of wind
and solar radiation and what you get with
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Jonathan Wright.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is with MetSpec in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And MetSpec is a company that's made an
improved static shield that we have tested
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bart Neff is at Campbell Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deployed these in a lot of cases,
collected a lot of data over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of text.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it basically, it says to determine the
quantity, the amount of error of static
[SPEAKER_00]: shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, so we can get accurate leaf to
air temperature differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about science,
what do we do in science?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the word research is re-search.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take what we thought we knew and study
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, do we find a lot of stuff that we
thought we knew and we didn't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not just us looking at these
errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 30 peer-reviewed papers on the
errors of static shields over the last 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's particularly big now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to quantify global warming
and air temperatures, well, we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, look, we can solve global
warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody just switched to aspirated
shields and the problem will go away
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to make the earth
appear to be cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are a couple of comparison
shields in this data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multi-plate shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arne Young has for long made an aspirated
shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the Darth Vader shield because
of the way the helmet looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opens up to get sensors in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not widely used at all because it is
a very power-hungry fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a centrifugal blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to run that unless you
have massive solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our stations are places where we have
low power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Apogee's goal was to make an
accurate aspirated shield that is also
[SPEAKER_00]: very low power.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these were some of the shields we
compared it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then statics have a humidity probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back to Peter Sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Difference from the active shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the active shield is always cooler,
but this data is just what you might
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the wind speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the wind is three to four meters a
second, we're down in the errors of 0.1,
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.2 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the errors were much worse over snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need to make measurements over
snow, static shields have particular
[SPEAKER_00]: problems because they're designed to block
the radiation coming in from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not designed to block reflected
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those errors get to one,
one and a half C.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are multiple measurements over a
long period of time, all summarized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we come back down to the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is measurements in the backyard
at Campbell Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple types of shields, a sonic
anemometer to get wind speed, multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them have that small yellow bead
thermistor inside the shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all measuring an accurate
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the met one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are met spec shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the types of shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into all the brands,
but there's a lot of stuff on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this data right here is just the
temperature difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the variation of just the yellow
bead thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we get to the data from,
I can't remember, I think we ran this for
[SPEAKER_00]: about a year in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this graph on, let's see, you're
right, shows a similar thing that we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: at Peter Sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only now, this is not over snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just over grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we compared a small thermistor
inside the shield with a humidity probe in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we all do it, is a humidity
probe in that shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's thermally massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that heats up more than the yellow bead
thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now even when we got pretty
significant wind speeds, we still were
[SPEAKER_00]: down around 0.2 degrees C heating from
that humidity probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that this line flattens out
suggests there's some offset in that
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't even go to zero by eight or nine
meters a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the humidity probes confound the
problem because they're just big,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they have an accurate PRT in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: More data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this in what we call the
backyard at apogee instruments,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big grassy area where we just,
same as Campbell's, are set up to do
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous testing of products,
characterized long-term stability of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a picture taken from the roof of
apogee of this line of shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were pleased that the apogee shield
slightly outperformed the RM Young shield,
[SPEAKER_00]: even with a much smaller fan, almost a
tenth of the power for the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is solar radiation and heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're talking differences in
tenths of a degree C among types of
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirated shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air is getting small, but we're
trying to get down as close as we can to
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example of testing that we've
done on temperature sensors and aspirated
[SPEAKER_00]: shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aspirated shield and the apogee
shield, it has PWM modulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running full blast, it takes 80 milliamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember that RM Young is right around
500 milliamps, so it's a big drop from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we have found is you only need to
run the fan full blast if it's no wind and
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can turn the fan down, especially
at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn the fan down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the wind is blowing, you can turn the
fan down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun's setting, turn the fan down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can optimize power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, we have many stations
running that aspirated shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's aspirated shield from a relatively
small solar panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still takes a lot more than the data
logger, but it's much less than previous
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirated shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hasn't really caught on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the apogee had steady sales of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still feel like, man, if people knew
the errors they have, there'd be more
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in trying to do aspirated shield
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I think most people just
eliminate it right away because they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I don't have the power to run a fan
aspirated shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, solar panels and batteries,
you don't have to be that much bigger to
[SPEAKER_00]: run the aspirated shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sensors and shields, just for getting
an accurate measurement of temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the places that aspirated shields
have found an application is in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature monitoring in fruit orchards,
where if you know anything about fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: production, they live and die by late
spring frost, which can kill the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and wipe out their yield for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the temperatures start to get close
to freezing, they start wind machines,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start running water sprinklers to
keep their plants from freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Utah, the growers tell me those wind
machines cost $10,000 an hour to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's worth it because the value of the
crop is greater than the cost of the
[SPEAKER_00]: running their wind machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: $10,000 an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, if they could delay turning those on
for a half an hour, they paid for their
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to turn them on unless
they have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they need them, they got to run
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are they measuring temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a static shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, well, that's at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not solar loading on the shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really have to have an
aspirated shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the data in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we did tests in an orchard,
these are calm nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get radiation frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's calm and there's not wind to mix
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lag time on those static shields was
enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the temperature in those was like
a half an hour to reach the true air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, whereas an aspirated shield
was fast response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the air temperature right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growers, the fruit growers,
are increasingly using aspirated shields,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just to get more accurate
temperatures, but to get faster response
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a network in Cache Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a project here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I turn these lights back on,
Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can probably get them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to talk for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a project here in Cache Valley
called the Atmospheric Mixing Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's run through the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, it's been largely funded with
the gracious help of the instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know how many visits you guys
have been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably don't come in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we get inversions all the time in
January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold air settles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cold air sits there and it's
trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our emissions stay with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the air quality deteriorates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state of Utah is getting a black
eye for low air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're starting to put more money into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are interested in the magnitude of
atmospheric mixing during these
[SPEAKER_00]: inversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people think, oh, there's no
mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just trapped air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these sensors, we have seen large
eddies of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, the temperature jumps
2 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: As warmer air mixes with the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these patterns of air
mixing in the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would only see that with accurate
measurements of air temperature with a
[SPEAKER_00]: fast response shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that's been helpful
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given talks about this project,
Atmospheric Mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really of interest if you live
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want to have good air in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a fascinating project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using carbon dioxide as a tracer gas
to look at the atmospheric mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding some really fascinating
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more atmospheric mixing than we
used to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all because we've got good
instruments out there so we can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you to interrupt me if you had
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have comprehensive knowledge on
all instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to talk about instruments
that you're not interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you what things you're most
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a picture in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of my work at the university is
funded by the fruit growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Utah is not a major agricultural
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a major fruit growing state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're second in the nation for
tart cherries, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't forget that a few hundred
million dollars a year of fruit sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these guys need to do frost
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made this flat disc that's painted
black to get a low-cost way to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature on a cold night with
no wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we call that the leaf and bud
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has just a thermistor sticking out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you run the numbers from energy
balance numbers, surface temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've measured 9 degrees C colder than the
air temperature at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: 9 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is turf temperature now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our climate people,
we have a station on campus that measures
[SPEAKER_00]: this in real-time graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorite stories is one of
our elite climate scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce, something is wrong with your
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the turf is 9 degrees C colder
than the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of my colleagues jumped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, let me give you a lecture on
atmospheric physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with the sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cooling to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now a fruit grower doesn't really
care what the air temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care what their bud temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a low-cost way to estimate
bud temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often model it depending on wind speed
and, well, mostly wind speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sky, long wave radiation to the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we sell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that same note, this is something I use
in teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a box, let me draw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can draw and talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this analogy works because I've
seen my students use it to teach other
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's stuck with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on that exact time topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got pictures of doing this in my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a big insulated box.
[SPEAKER_00]: All insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom of this, we put a little
dish of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paint it black, black saucer with water in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take this at night, put it outside
under a clear sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's take July.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good warm July night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature over here is 20 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this insulation prevents this from
warming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be cellophane over the top or it
can just be open, but there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens to the temperature of the
water in that dish on a clear sky night,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the mountains here with
close to outer space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry air, very clear sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hook this up to your Campbell
scientific data logger with one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: precision thermistors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drill a tiny little hole, you measure
it and you get the, yeah, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CR 100,000 X over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You measure that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water starts to come in equilibrium
with the sky temperature because of
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is losing energy, shown here in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Losing energy by long wave radiation to
the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it loses it and it loses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sky temperature, well,
the temperature of outer space is zero
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skies is really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can't warm back up because it's got
all this insulation and there's not wind
[SPEAKER_00]: to blow warm air in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets colder and colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally the water freezes on a warm
summer night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make water freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I teach this, I show pictures of
me with this setup sitting there night
[SPEAKER_00]: with my computer and measuring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can make the water freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the sun comes up and you cover it and
you have a thermally, environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: cooled refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in some cases in the tropics,
with no electricity, you can use this to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep stuff cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a powerful example of what
radiation can do to surface temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: and why understanding radiation is
important to understanding surface
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures beyond air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into this a lot because of our
infrared sensor for surface temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this gradient from leaf to air,
mostly for agricultural irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: predicting transpiration rates of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long answer to the leaf and bud
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the leaf and bud sensor is a much
cheaper sensor than the infrared stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for fruit growers, they can buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sell them?
[SPEAKER_01]: In New Zealand, you wouldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to worry about freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've worked for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the fruit growers in Utah use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other measurements that you're stuck on?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't know about it, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say a few things about humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the next most important
parameter that we worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just now my broad experience
over doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in graduate school a long time
ago, capacitance chip sensors came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Visala was the first to do these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody was, wow, you know,
because we were really doing the wet bulb
[SPEAKER_00]: psychrometers and man, all these super
labor intensive ways to get humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And capacitance sensors came out and they
were a huge breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were not so stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get contaminated with some other gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go haywire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have multiple companies making
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coatings are much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensors are far more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we use capacitance humidity
sensors all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both Campbell Scientific and Apogee have
started selling capacitance type humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors from a company called EE
Electronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our tests with those over long-term
periods of time indicate impressive
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of those sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do we get better job new
relief in air temperatures, but
[SPEAKER_00]: capacitance humidity sensors have come a
long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they continue to come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensors getting better and cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things that drives this
whole enterprise is weather measurement is
[SPEAKER_00]: the progress worldwide that we have made
in better sensors and better electronics
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure those sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, now the new frontier is
just getting the data in the cloud and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it sent by wireless so you can see
all the data and better summarize it in
[SPEAKER_00]: real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My field is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weather is not many disciplines
where weather is more important than food
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a big thing for agricultural
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, now climate change,
effects of climate change continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: drive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's fun to see the new developments
in sensors every year, whether we build
[SPEAKER_00]: them and we sell them or somebody else
builds them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got to tell you a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an international show in Europe
each year, Met Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Meteorological Technology
International, MTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all the major equipment
manufacturers getting together and showing
[SPEAKER_00]: their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a company that organizes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Apogee's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is Campbell's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're many years in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to know the organizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they go, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't believe these instrument people,
these meteorologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are all talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a show that's an automotive show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people put curtains around their booth
because they're so confidential about what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just paranoid about their
competitors finding out some little
[SPEAKER_00]: secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you guys are just complimenting
each other on the new instruments you're
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's night and day different than the
automotive people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes this field so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so science driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're competing on good science,
not smoking mirrors and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also pushes people to make better
instruments, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about solar radiation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another key parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The classic, I have pictures in here of
what thermopile pyranometers look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were built by Epley for years and
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in graduate school,
it was whoa, you got an Epley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't visited Epley, but they cannot
have much of a science department because
[SPEAKER_00]: they haven't released an improved
pyranometer in a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the shape is still the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: White flying saucer with the glass dome
and a black body underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kipp and Zonen has been working on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right down the street is
Huxaflux, both in the same city,
[SPEAKER_00]: both making, competing with each other for
the best pyranometers in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a big market because of solar
photovoltaics, precisely measuring that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the instruments are still expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe 30 years, ago Lycor came out with
a silicon pyranometer, way cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's calibrated to sun and you get
close to the same accuracy for a fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is used worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that became a standard on lots of
weather stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many, probably 20 years ago,
Apogee also made a silicon pyranometer at
[SPEAKER_00]: lower cost than Lycor at the same type of
sensor to get solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are fine as long as you have a sunny
day in the same conditions that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they subsample the solar spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if any time you subsample and predict
the whole thing, you're okay as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: your calibration conditions don't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the tests Apogee has done is how
accurate are those sensors on cloudy days?
[SPEAKER_00]: The water vapor absorption bands mean that
there's more shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's all shortwave?
[SPEAKER_00]: That more shorter wavelength radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sensors can have up to a 14% error
on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of a spectral shift caused by
water vapor absorption in the clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been really underappreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Apogee started looking at approaches to
measure all the wavelengths without having
[SPEAKER_00]: to use the cost of the black body
pyranometer that is used by Kippensohn and
[SPEAKER_00]: Huxaflux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few years ago, so that we find
things and test and test and test,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole roof is, not the whole roof,
but most of the roof at Apogee is covered
[SPEAKER_00]: with test sensors as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built a staircase to go up there to
keep doing tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee developed a black body pyranometer
that's small, it's a blue color,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't subsample the spectrum
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measures the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't have that cloudy day error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close to the same accuracy as those
more expensive, larger black body
[SPEAKER_00]: pyranometers by Kippensohn and Huxaflux.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some on the other side of the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys will show them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sold here by Campbell Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another story, but we had a lot of
meetings to decide what color that should
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, Campbell's chose the color,
but it's a certain blue to be a trademark
[SPEAKER_00]: color of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, that's a unique blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, Campbell Scientific on the
front and you turn it around on the back
[SPEAKER_00]: and it says, in two point font,
it says, manufactured by Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make that and Campbell's sells it in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty big breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sensor is much lower cost,
much smaller, digital output, compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Delft Netherlands bigger sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another example of a continuing
march to get more cost effective
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, better measurements for
lower cost, fast response, all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation has certainly been a core
strength of Apogee, starting with quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors and pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once Apogee got a black body pyranometer,
that led to the development of a net
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're on the other side of the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wow, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my helper here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for remembering this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Net radiation is something that's so
expensive that we've almost always modeled
[SPEAKER_00]: it instead of try to measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some papers in the literature
about the errors you get when you try and
[SPEAKER_00]: model it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sensors are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not only expensive, but they're
heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this new technology, we could make
a much smaller net radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And net radiation means up and down short
wave and up and down long wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's four sensors in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you the full radiation energy
balance for a canopy, for precision
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements of all kinds of things,
including irrigation requirements of
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get reflected radiation,
you can't be sub-sampling the radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to measure it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these went into this sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, remember those channels on the
data logger?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got four sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have four differential channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've used up your whole data logger just
to measure net radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here comes SDI-12 output, Modbus output.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has SDI-12 output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those numbers are put into one
and sent to the data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to offer this at a
considerably lower cost than the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had lots and lots of test data on
this comparing them to Kippenzonen and
[SPEAKER_00]: Huxaflux pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another steady march of sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coupled with the digital output,
so it's easier to interface this with a
[SPEAKER_00]: data logger now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you build stuff, and it catches
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one that did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sales on this have been bigger than we
thought they would be, the worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what else do I want to say
about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that comes from radiation
measurement being a core expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The long-wave radiation is the same thing
as our infrared sensors, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: mangaring long-wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the up and down long waves come from
our expertise into a long wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, lots of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're testing, so FLE, they're old,
but they seem to be quite well respected
[SPEAKER_00]: by people I'm not familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does the FLEG sensors compare to,
say, FLEs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start by saying, if you get a good
reputation, if you get a bad reputation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a good reputation, hard to
change it, too, for the reasons you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in fact, are my EPLIs in the
museum, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of them is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple problems with EPLIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is really quite poor cosine response.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the low angle light, it's either under
measured or over measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's multiple papers in the
literature on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, man, if I was in charge of EPLI,
I'd be going to work on fixing that
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to my knowledge, they have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not released new sensors that
fix that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That causes errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a competitive market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get these numbers to 1%
or 2% a day, and now you got a 5% cosine
[SPEAKER_00]: error at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also had issues with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be accurate over a range of
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all you're trying to do is solar
radiation, not temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the big things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thermopile device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the big things that
Kippenzona and Huxaflux have made great
[SPEAKER_00]: progress on, making their measurements
more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on who you talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're talking to kind of
cutting-edge meteorologists, EPLI's sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of in the dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it depends how much you've looked at
the new improvements of sensors over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always think maybe they'll come
out with something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to my knowledge, they haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you had some network of EPLIs and
you wanted to have consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't recommend them for a new
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it is driven by the fierce
competition between Huxaflux and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kippenzona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're both in Delft in the
Netherlands, and I don't know how far
they've gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far apart?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two or three kilometers apart or
something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, point three kilometers apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got binoculars looking at each
other, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of my favorites is Huxaflux
comes out with an ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quest for global domination is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introducing the new Huxaflux.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of competition they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty fierce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they both make really good
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're high-end, so it leaves the
door open to come in at an intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All instruments, you know, you draw a
graph and see if I can draw this graph up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a really classic
instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a graph always looks something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really pay a lot of money to go
from here to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, those last few percent to
get really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of us has an unlimited supply of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always trying to pick the most
cost-effective sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go down in here and you get cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what you're doing,
there's a zone in there that's a real
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effective midpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's certainly served Apogee well as
identifying that for different markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could build something with this
accuracy for this price, it'll be very
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the case with this net
radiometers and pyranometers is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit some point in here where we're almost
as good at accuracy and half the cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it depends on the application,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings up customer support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, if you can't educate your customers,
you shouldn't be in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to help them make better
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach them the options and don't
inappropriately push your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would never say that the Apogee
pyranometers are better than Kippenzonen
[SPEAKER_00]: and Huxaflex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the test data to show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price is easy because you can look
that number up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the performance requires a lot of test
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, don't get me started on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People write these specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew could tell you this, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies exceed their specs
regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, Campbell Scientific is a
company that exceeds their specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you a dozen stories where we
tested specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in every case, the data loggers
exceeded the specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies...
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, they're absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't even come close to meeting the
specs they publish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lesser companies selling all kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more a company tests a product,
the better they can define the performance
[SPEAKER_00]: and the specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to get the sensor to
market when you're spending all that time
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is to help customers
understand specifications and what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: most appropriate sensor for their market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, any company that can educate
their customers has got customers for
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it that they learn from the
people in that company and they will come
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you try to... If you do
something wrong, you get to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those sorts of things, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we doing on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's too bad there's a door because
it's nice to have the workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole life is teaching, and I have the
great honor to teach some really smart
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are now working at
Campbell's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are working at Campbell's and
some of them are working at Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things that makes
the companies go, is access to the talent
[SPEAKER_00]: of the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of those people, they love living
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they turn down higher paying jobs and
stay here for work for the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I've learned about
teaching is you never teach anything when
[SPEAKER_00]: you stand up and give a lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the learning happens when you go
outside and apply the theory that you
[SPEAKER_00]: learned in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students come back all the time and they
say, oh, man, I learned more in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year after I graduated than I did in my
four years getting my bachelor's degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set you up for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that theory, boom, everything clicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The learning happened when they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they get to ask their own
questions and drill it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way we set up lots of time
to look at the instruments and ask
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to know our people that do the
customer support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you need help, you know who to
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be here and I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to interact with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to interacting with you
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we have dinner after this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great honor to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
