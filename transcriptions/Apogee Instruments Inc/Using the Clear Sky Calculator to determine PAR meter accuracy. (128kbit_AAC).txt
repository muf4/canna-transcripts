[SPEAKER_00]: Is your PAR meter no longer giving you
readings that you can trust?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing less than reliable results
than when you first set up your meter
[SPEAKER_00]: several months ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you replace your meter,
try these few steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, make sure that your meter is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blocking the optical path between the
source and the sensor can cause low
[SPEAKER_00]: readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dust, dirt, and other debris can be
cleaned from the sensor using a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-abrasive cloth or a cotton swab
sprinkled with deionized water or window
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium deposits from irrigation water can
leave a thin white film on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be removed using a diluted acid
such as vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you're cleaning your
sensor regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, you cleaned your sensor,
but the measurements still don't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out what they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The team at Apogee has created a tool that
allows you to see what PAR, EPAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: UV, and shortwave radiation measurements
should be under ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can see just how far off your
meter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the ClearSky Calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tool is down at clearskycalculator
.com and it works with all PAR meters,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just Apogee meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, the measurements on your meter
should be taken as close to solar noon at
[SPEAKER_00]: summer solstice in non-polluted skies,
minimal humidity, and the sensor perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware this calculator will give you an
ideal number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have less than ideal conditions,
be aware that your numbers may be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tool is not to be used for
calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its purpose is to identify if meter
readings are drastically out of spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use the calculator, take a measurement
from your meter and enter that measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: into the PPFD field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter your zip code, country, date,
and time, and then hit calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calculator will show you how far off
your meter is measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's off by more than 10%, a button
will appear with a contact Apogee for
[SPEAKER_00]: recalibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it's a mathematical model
with limitations, but if you still feel
[SPEAKER_00]: that your meter is out of spec,
then you can send it in for recalibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: After recalibration, you can get back to
confident data acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, over time, all PAR meters
will begin to drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, it's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factors such as age, usage, environmental
conditions can all affect the accuracy of
[SPEAKER_00]: every PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being familiar with the sensor's
specifications, operation, and
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements will help you recognize
errors before days or weeks worth of data
[SPEAKER_00]: become unreliable and unusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments has built a reputation
of not just creating accurate PAR meters,
[SPEAKER_00]: but of PAR meters that stay accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we offer an industry-leading
four-year warranty on all of our PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point, every PAR meter is past
its expected life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how bad is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to me straight, doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time of death, 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, if the unfortunate does occur,
Apogee will provide a discount on a
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, feel free to
leave them in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and have a good day.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
