[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Ben Crabb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do technical sales and support here at
Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today to talk to you about a set
of new coefficients that we have for our
[SPEAKER_00]: MC100 chlorophyll concentration meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have two different sets,
two new sets, two new species that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: measure accurately, cannabis and grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll briefly go over how this meter
takes measurements of absolute chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, and then we'll go into how
to get those new coefficients,
[SPEAKER_00]: select them, and start taking
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very briefly, the operation of this
meter is based on the transmittance of
[SPEAKER_00]: light at red and near-infrared wavelengths
through a plant leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This item has two LEDs in it, one of which
emits light in a red wavelength of 653
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one emits light in a
near-infrared wavelength of 931
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the red wavelength, the plants can use
that type of light for photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so most of that light gets absorbed
and used by the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light at the longer near-infrared
wavelengths can't be used by the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it will just pass through the leaf
and the leaf doesn't do much with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it gets reflected off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can derive this CCI value,
this chlorophyll concentration index or
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll content index, as the ratio of
transmission values at the near-infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths and the red wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this example shown, we have a
CCI value of about 7.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a nice relative indication,
but it's unitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the great advantages of this
meter is that it will convert that
[SPEAKER_00]: unitless measure into a measure of
absolute chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we do that is we follow a
methodology, a method outlined in this
[SPEAKER_00]: academic paper, in situ measurement of
leaf chlorophyll concentration analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: the optical slash absolute relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was published by Christopher Perry,
Mark Blanquist, Bruce Bugby in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read it at your leisure if
you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the paper, they correlate that CCI
value to the quantity of chlorophyll in
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf, which they derive using
laboratory techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do this for 22 or 23 different
species, all of which have coefficients
[SPEAKER_00]: loaded onto our meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a brief look at the results of
their paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis, we have the CCI values,
those unitless values.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the y-axis, we have chlorophyll
concentration measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: In absolute values of micromoles per meter
squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that there's a positive
relationship, but it's not perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of a curve to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little bit of difference
depending on the species that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these different colored lines
correlates to a different type of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the bottom panel, we have the
curve for the general set of coefficients
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could use if you're studying a
plant that is not included in this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another look at those type of
curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes out of our owner's manual,
and we just show wheat, rice, and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're similar, but not precisely
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to have a curve particular to
your species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this video is inspired by our new
cannabis coefficients as well as grape
[SPEAKER_00]: coefficients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a look at the new cannabis
coefficients in green compared to wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: and the general set of coefficients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that cannabis has a
different shape to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the same CCI value, CCI value is on
the x-axis down here and absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the same CCI value, it's about
almost a two times difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.8 times difference between cannabis and
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at the same chlorophyll
value, it's about a two and a half times
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in CCI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this new set of coefficients will
be great for our cannabis customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're at the part where I'll go
over very quickly how to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: coefficients, load them onto your meter,
select them, and take measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will download the coefficients from our
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will connect this to our computer using
a little USB cord it came with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll drag the new files onto the folder
that shows up from this MC100.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll disconnect it, then we'll navigate
to the coefficients on the screen here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can start taking
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just pushing down this arm with
the leaf in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
