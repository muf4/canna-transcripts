[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about quantum sensors,
or sometimes we call them PAR sensors,
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetically active radiation
sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look the same, but instead of being
designed to measure all of the short wave
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths from the sun or an electric
light, they only measure the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetically active wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically defined as 400 to 700
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same wavelengths that the human eye
sees are the same wavelengths that drive
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an often used measurement in plant
research because it tells us how much
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation is available or how many photons
are available to make photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is multiple radiation sources
available used to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing some here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun, lots of different electric lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, LEDs, light emitting diodes,
are becoming more and more common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually a photograph taken
from Bruce's lab at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got all these little growth
chambers, each one with a different
[SPEAKER_01]: colored LED or a different combination of
colored LEDs in them to see what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: effects different color treatments have on
plant growth and plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep pressing the wrong button.
[SPEAKER_01]: So LEDs are becoming more and more common
all the time, especially in research
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs are often narrow band, meaning they
only output a narrow range of wavelengths,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas radiation sources like the sun or
some of these electric lights are
[SPEAKER_01]: broadband.
[SPEAKER_01]: They output a lot of radiation across the
photosynthetically active range.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main point that I want to make
here is that accurate photosynthetically
[SPEAKER_01]: active radiation or PAR measurements are
required for a host of applications,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if we're interested in
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we start talking about the
sensors, here's just a few definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably have heard these terms before
and seen them defined, but it always helps
[SPEAKER_01]: to review a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already mentioned that
photosynthetically active radiation is the
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation that drives photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photon flux density is just the number of
photons that flow through a unit area per
[SPEAKER_01]: unit time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just counting photons,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we either count the micromoles of
photons per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an instantaneous unit that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we count the moles of photons per meter
squared per day on a daily time scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we characterize the flux of
photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The photosynthetic photon flux density,
PPFD, is just the photon flux density
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated over our photosynthetically
active range, so 400 to 700 nanometer
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelength range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we have a quantum sensor or a
PAR sensor, one of these guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the number that it's measuring
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put out this unit, so it measures
the micromoles of photons per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the incident photons on the
detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we integrate that number
over a whole day, we get the moles of
[SPEAKER_01]: photons per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yield photon flux density is kind of
like the photosynthetic photon flux
[SPEAKER_01]: density.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of just integrating over the
400 to 700 nanometer range to get yield
[SPEAKER_01]: photon flux, we actually weight the photon
flux by the plant response to photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we sum it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one will become a lot more clear
on my next slide, because I will show you
[SPEAKER_01]: a graph that illustrates the difference
between this one and this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a quantum sensor is this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the instrument that we use to
measure PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that we often call them
quantum sensors is because one photon is a
[SPEAKER_01]: single quantum of radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But quantum sensor can be kind of a
confusing term, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays you often hear them called PAR
sensors, because they are measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: PAR sensor and quantum sensor mean the
exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the graph that I mentioned when
I was describing the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic photon flux and yield
photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wavelength on the x-axis and then just
relative quantum yield, or the response to
[SPEAKER_01]: photons on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the green line is actually measured
data from a number of different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listed some of the publications here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Keith McCree at Texas A&M University
was the first to do this back in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then others followed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And found similar data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what he did is he took a leaf and he
measured the photosynthetic response,
[SPEAKER_01]: or basically how much carbon did that leaf
uptake at each wavelength of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he used a light with specific filters
over the top of it to give him really
[SPEAKER_01]: narrow wavelength ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just measured the carbon uptake of
single leaves as a function of wavelength.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found that the photosynthetic
response actually looked like the green
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant leaves respond a little bit
more to blue radiation than they do green
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're most sensitive or most
responsive to the red radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the data that McCree and others
measured for single leaves, we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember that it was in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was plants grown under controlled
conditions, in many cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they also measured field plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a low light environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it was single leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a more useful and universal definition
of photosynthetically active radiation is
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than trying to weight measurements
of PAR by this green line, we just assume
[SPEAKER_01]: that all the photons between 400 and 700
nanometers are equally efficient at making
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis happen in plant leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the universally accepted definition
of PAR is what we call this defined plant
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic response, where we just
give equal weight to all the photons
[SPEAKER_01]: within the 400 to 700 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't give any weight to photons
outside the 400 to 700 nanometer range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use that as our definition of
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so PAR sensors, these kind of devices,
should have a spectral response or a
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity that matches this black line
as close as they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are really a couple of
options for measuring PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to use a quantum sensor like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a broadband device, meaning it
gives you a single signal, one number.
[SPEAKER_01]: An analog device means it would output
voltage that represents the sum of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the radiation that's incident on this
detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it should be the sum of all of
the radiation between 400 and 700
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that number, that voltage that it
outputs, is weighted by the spectral
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity of the sensor itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purpose of the filter in front of
the photon detector is to try to give us
[SPEAKER_01]: the best match that we can to 400 to 700
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a single detector that
gives us an output that should be
[SPEAKER_01]: proportional to PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the spectral response of the sensor
is dependent on the transmission of the
[SPEAKER_01]: filter and the sensitivity of the
underlying detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternatively, rather than using a quantum
sensor for PAR measurement, we could use a
[SPEAKER_01]: spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are hyperspector.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spectral devices, meaning we're
getting signals at multiple wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you actually can get spectroradiometers
that give you a measurement at every
[SPEAKER_01]: single nanometer within the 400 to 700
nanometer range.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be quite fine resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes they give you a measurement at
every five nanometers, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is you're actually getting a
measurement at multiple positions across
[SPEAKER_01]: the wavelength range of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a quantum sensor only gives you
PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spectroradiometer gives you both PAR and
the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only do you get photosynthetically
active radiation, but you get the shape of
[SPEAKER_01]: the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some applications that might be
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here the detector array determines
the spectral response.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spectroradiometer is a, in practice,
it's a relative relatively simple device.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a prism or maybe a diffraction
grating where the light enters the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that prism or diffraction grating is
actually separating the light into the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somewhere behind that prism,
you have a whole array of detectors that
[SPEAKER_01]: measures the intensity of the individual
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get multiple signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like a relatively simple
device on paper, but in practice they can
[SPEAKER_01]: be quite complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only thing that really
determines the spectral response or the
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity of a spectroradiometer is how
well is it calibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can accurately calibrate each of the
wavelengths, then we have an accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: quantum sensor independent of the light
source that we're trying to measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's lots of different options
for quantum sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I'm showing you some of the more
common commercially available quantum
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how well their spectral sensitivity or
their response to photons matches our
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the black line is what we're trying to
match, because that's our definition of
[SPEAKER_01]: the photosynthetic photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the colored lines, the blue and
red lines, are the actual sensitivities of
[SPEAKER_01]: the different, some of the different
sensors that are available on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kippen-Zonen has a sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sky Instruments has a sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: LiCOR has a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The model LI190R has now been replaced by
a newer model from, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_01]: the LI190 has now been replaced by a newer
model from LiCOR called the LI190R.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Apogee we build a couple different
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SQ110 is the one that we've sold for
years and it's still available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the SQ500 is a new model that is a
better match to the photosynthetic photon
[SPEAKER_01]: flux weighting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having this information, we can
actually now make estimates of what kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of errors we can expect when we use these
sensors for different light sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning, Bruce talked a little bit about
how the solar spectrum can change for
[SPEAKER_01]: clear versus cloudy conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we calibrate these sensors in clear
conditions, for example, and we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: none of them have a perfect match to our
definition of photosynthesis, we can
[SPEAKER_01]: expect some errors when we try to use them
in cloudy conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, for example, if they were calibrated
in the laboratory under an electric light,
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens when we try to use them for
measurements under a different electric
[SPEAKER_01]: light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what happens when we take them out of
the laboratory and try to use them for
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements in sunlight?
[SPEAKER_01]: All we have to know, we need three pieces
of information basically to estimate
[SPEAKER_01]: spectral errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, we need to know the spectral
response of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that information here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to know the spectral output of the
radiation source that was used to
[SPEAKER_01]: calibrate the sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we need to know the spectral
output of the radiation source that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to better illustrate that, let's just
take an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see here's the spectral
response of the Apogee model SQ110.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the traditional Apogee quantum
sensor that's been available for several
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that it's not a great
match to our definition of photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we measure some of the UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as sensitive to the blue as it
needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it misses some of this red radiation
out here when we get close to 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this mismatch between the actual sensor
response to photons and our definition of
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic radiation is going to cause
spectral errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of an extreme example,
let's say we were measuring an LED that
[SPEAKER_01]: was a blue and red mix where the red peak
was like 660 or 670 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's a lot of output from
this LED that's beyond the sensitivity
[SPEAKER_01]: range of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the sensor's not going to count
those photons because it's not sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: to them and it will cause spectral error.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an equation we can use to
actually calculate spectral errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned previously,
the only bits of information that we need,
[SPEAKER_01]: this S is the spectral sensitivity of the
sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this example, it would be the blue
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The I calibration is the spectral output.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the light source we use to calibrate
the sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be an electric light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this I measurement is the
spectral output of the lamp that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be this LED for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm about to show you is error
calculations using this equation for all
[SPEAKER_01]: six of these quantum sensors that I have
spectral information for right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the table shows data where we use
sunlight on a clear day as the calibration
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of them have zero error under
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see what kind of errors they
have for a whole bunch of other light
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got sun spectrum on a cloudy day,
a sun spectrum that's reflected from a
[SPEAKER_01]: grass canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually, in addition to
measuring incoming radiation, some
[SPEAKER_01]: applications you might want to invert the
quantum sensor like this and measure
[SPEAKER_01]: reflected radiation from the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a measurement of incoming
radiation and a measurement of reflected
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation, it tells you how much of the
photosynthetic radiation is being absorbed
[SPEAKER_01]: by the plants at the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Bruce just mentioned in the
previous talk that if this were a silicon
[SPEAKER_01]: cell pyranometer, you can't invert it like
that and make measurements of the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's large spectral errors that
are associated with doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he showed a table of some of those
errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a quantum sensor, however,
one of these PAR sensors that's designed
[SPEAKER_01]: to measure photosynthetic radiation
instead of solar radiation, you can take
[SPEAKER_01]: it and invert it like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these numbers here reflected from
glass gives you an idea of what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: error you can expect when you invert a
quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes, and I'm going to talk about
this particular application in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more detail in a minute, we want to
put quantum sensors underneath plant
[SPEAKER_01]: canopies and measure how much of the
photosynthetic radiation is transmitted
[SPEAKER_01]: through the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the kind of errors you can
expect if you measure underneath plant
[SPEAKER_01]: canopies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is data for a wheat canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I failed to mention that all of
the numbers that you see here are
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages, not actual radiation units,
so not micromoles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_01]: second, but percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a whole list of electric
lights that people might use in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or a growth chamber
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple things that you can see by
looking at the data in this table is that
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them work quite well for most of
the radiation sources on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: except for the Apogee model SQ110.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these LEDs, you can see the errors
get pretty large.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because of the data I showed you on
the previous table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have an excellent match to the
definition of photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to be careful using quantum
sensors for certain radiation sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that they are going
to capture the photons that you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice of the other sensors,
some of the worst errors also tend to be
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a 3.8 and 3.6%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: A 3% over there that's an LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs are tricky to measure, so for those
of you that are working in greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring LEDs, sometimes the best option
for that might be a spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned when I was talking about
the differences between quantum sensors
[SPEAKER_01]: and spectroradiometers, if you're
spectroradiometer is calibrated accurately
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's measuring all the wavelengths
individually, then spectral error doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to worry about spectral
error with a spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main difference, so you might be
asking, well, if this is the case,
[SPEAKER_01]: why would I ever use a quantum sensor to
measure PAR?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't I just use a spectroradiometer
every time?
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is the price tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quantum sensors tend to be in the low
hundreds to maybe the mid hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of cost, spectroradiometers tend
to be an order of magnitude higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the thousands, the low
thousands to maybe even the mid to higher
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the real difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quantum sensors are often the measurement
of choice because they give you accuracy
[SPEAKER_01]: that's good enough for the application,
and they're much lower cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this is just a brief comparison of
everything we've covered up to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quantum sensors are subject to spectral
error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectroradiometers are not if they're
calibrated accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quantum sensors give you a broadband
measurement, meaning one number or one
[SPEAKER_01]: signal that's proportional to PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can only get PAR from a quantum
sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spectroradiometer, not only do you get
PAR, you get the spectrum if the spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: is required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just talked about the
differences in price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple more review points.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of commercial quantum sensors
available, and I showed at least six of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, and they're spectral errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of them have minimal errors,
less than 5% when measuring lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different light sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then remember, PAR is almost
universally reported as photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: photon flux density in units of
micromolecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can convert that to micromoles per
meter squared per second, but it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: converted to other units if the spectrum
is known.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that I put this point up
here is often we get people that contact
[SPEAKER_01]: us that they need measurements in units of
watts per meter squared or even units of
[SPEAKER_01]: lumens per meter squared lux on occasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: These units aren't often used in
environmental applications and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: science, but on occasion they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can convert PPFD measurements
from a quantum sensor to other units if
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce showed a table like this for apogee
pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's similar information for apogee
quantum sensors, just some specifications
[SPEAKER_01]: to give you an idea of the performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the directional response or the cosine
response for a quantum sensor is very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar to the cosine response.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a pyranometer, the temperature
response is also similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stability is a little bit better for
the quantum sensors that we tested,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the calibration uncertainty is listed
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's skip over that summary slide just
because we've pretty much discussed
[SPEAKER_01]: everything already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned I wanted to talk about a
specific application of intercepted
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show you something really quick
before we go through the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little brochure from Western
Sydney University that I picked up
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday here in the Hawkesbury
Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a part, I'll blow it up on the
document camera so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually a picture and a short
caption from the brochure that I found
[SPEAKER_01]: here at the institute yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, this photosynthetically
active radiation sensor measures light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity below the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are combined with sensors above the
canopy to estimate how much shading is
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring, which correlates to the amount
of leaf area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one application of these PAR
measurements is above canopy and below
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy measurements to try to estimate how
much radiation is being absorbed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant canopy and how much is being
transmitted to the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that information, not only does
it tell us how much of the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation are the plants absorbing,
but it also tells us something about the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf area in between the sensor that's
above the canopy and the sensor that's
[SPEAKER_01]: below the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this application is actually taking
place right here at this institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk a little bit about it for
just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's switch back over to the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I actually have a picture here of
what's called, hang on, it always does a
[SPEAKER_01]: little hiccup before it comes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a picture of what's called a line
quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And making a measurement of the radiation
underneath a corn canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I'm showing a crop canopy,
but you could do this for a pasture or an
[SPEAKER_01]: orchard or a forest, whatever you were
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a line quantum sensor is just like
this quantum sensor, except for there are
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple sensors along the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: This specific one has 10 sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each one of these circles that you see
here is a sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those 10 sensors are spread along a
bar that's approximately 70 centimeters
[SPEAKER_01]: long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that you want multiple
sensors when you make under canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements is that the, and you can see
it in this picture, the light environment
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath a plant canopy is not uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see these two sensors up here
are in a light fleck where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually getting a lot of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the rest of the sensors are in the
shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you make measurements of
radiation underneath the canopy with the
[SPEAKER_01]: line quantum sensor, remember that the
radiation is often non-uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works really well to measure with the
line quantum sensor because then you get
[SPEAKER_01]: an average along the length of the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And radiation under the canopy should be
measured in multiple locations because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's non-uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it often works best to make a
measurement in one location, move it,
[SPEAKER_01]: make a measurement in another location,
move it, make a measurement in another
[SPEAKER_01]: location, and average the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you get a pretty representative
idea of what the mean radiation
[SPEAKER_01]: environment is like underneath the plant
canopy and also how variable it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to give you an idea, the equations
are pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the intercepted radiation,
you just measure the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation above the canopy and below the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The transmittance is the below canopy
measurement divided by the above canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fraction intercepted is one
minus the transmittance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to have a quantum sensor
above the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a line quantum sensor below the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just plug the numbers in to
get intercepted radiation, transmittance,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the fraction of intercepted radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for a relatively sparse canopy like
this one here, the leaf area index might
[SPEAKER_01]: be roughly one meter squared of leaf area
per meter squared of ground area.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of the day on a sunny day,
the transmittance would be about 50%,
[SPEAKER_01]: where roughly half of the sunlight that
you're measuring above the canopy would
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get transmitted below the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to move to something like this,
where we have a much higher leaf area
[SPEAKER_01]: index, say something on the order of five
meter squared per meter squared,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the day on a sunny day,
the transmittance would be about an order
[SPEAKER_01]: of magnitude lower, closer to 5% of the
radiation above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get transmitted to the soil
below the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once we have this information,
once we have the transmittance,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can actually get some sense of the leaf
area index, if that's what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this shows you four different plots
of transmittance as a function of leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: area index.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this would be for a solar zenith angle
of 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 degrees on a relatively clear day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that we have four different
lines and they're spaced like that is not
[SPEAKER_01]: only does the leaf area influence the
transmittance, but the orientation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves can also have a big impact on the
transmittance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the green line would represent a
canopy where most of the leaves are
[SPEAKER_01]: positioned horizontally, whereas the red
line would represent a canopy where most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the leaves are positioned vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out that most plant canopies,
I'm not as familiar with forests,
[SPEAKER_01]: but crops tend to be somewhere near these
two black lines where you have a fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: even distribution of both horizontal and
vertical leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's what the data look like now
at a solar zenith angle of 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll toggle back once just so you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also shows you that not only does leaf
area and the position or the orientation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the leaves have a big influence on
transmittance, but so does the position of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we know something about the leaf
angle distribution, or if we can make
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements when all of the lines are
converged or close to one another,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can get a good idea of the leaf area
index of our canopy of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've actually been working on a
research project in an alfalfa canopy over
[SPEAKER_01]: the summer, and we wanted to get some idea
of the leaf area index as a function of
[SPEAKER_01]: the height of the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we made a couple measurements in
the recent past at different heights.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was here when the alfalfa was 70
centimeters tall, we got a transmission of
[SPEAKER_01]: about 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would correspond to a leaf area of
about 1.7 to 1.8 meters squared per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we made measurements later in the
growing season when the alfalfa was much
[SPEAKER_01]: taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 64 centimeters tall and we
got a transmittance that was an order of
[SPEAKER_01]: magnitude lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would correspond to a leaf area of
about 4.7 or 4.8 meters squared per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that these estimates of leaf
area, 1.8 for a 17 centimeter alfalfa and
[SPEAKER_01]: 4.7 for 64 centimeter alfalfa,
are very close to actual values.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to sample the leaves,
destructively sample the leaves and
[SPEAKER_01]: measure the leaf area, we would get very
similar numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can, if you're careful with the
measurements, use transmittance data from
[SPEAKER_01]: quantum sensors measuring above and below
the canopy to get some idea of leaf area
[SPEAKER_01]: and canopy architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So real quick, I mentioned reflected
radiation a minute ago, so I won't spend
[SPEAKER_01]: too much time on this slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also measure reflected
radiation using quantum sensors where you
[SPEAKER_01]: orient one up and one down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the one measuring the
reflectance, if you take the ratio of
[SPEAKER_01]: those two numbers, you get the
reflectance.
[SPEAKER_01]: One minus that number gives you the amount
of, or the fraction of the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation that was absorbed by the plant
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you an idea of how much radiation
is being absorbed by the plant canopy and
[SPEAKER_01]: used for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just a couple points here,
the sensor should be level for both the
[SPEAKER_01]: upward and downward measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: The downward, the upward measurement,
it's obvious why that one has to be level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce talked about this in his
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's tilted a little bit one way or the
other, you can actually get pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: significant errors on a sunny day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're tilted a little bit towards the
sun, it's actually going to read quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit higher than it should if it was level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it happens to be not level and
tilted a little bit away from the sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get a measurement that's a lot
lower than it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason it's important to make sure the
downward one is close to level as well is
[SPEAKER_01]: so that in a place like Logan,
Utah, where Bruce and I come from,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wouldn't matter that much because the
entire valley where we live is surrounded
[SPEAKER_01]: by tall mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in places where it's flat,
when the sun first comes up over the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon, you want to make sure that the
direct sunlight doesn't hit the diffuser.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's tilted a little bit one way or
the other, in the early morning or late
[SPEAKER_01]: evening hours, you might actually get some
direct sunlight hitting the sensor that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not reflected from the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just want to be careful that you
level both sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's all I had for the quantum
sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions about photosynthetically
active radiation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Measurements above canopy or below canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using reflective mulch to reflect
light back up into the bottom tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the ground is quite slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should the downward one be at right angles
to the ground, or should we measure it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that really depends on you and
what you want to quantify for your
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, in my opinion, and I'm not a
tree expert, you would want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: probably still a horizontal measurement
because the bottom of the tree canopy is
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly parallel to the ground,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right angle, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it depends on which
orientation you're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: quantifying the radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that there's a right or wrong
answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Bruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that people have long
predicted photosynthetic radiation from
[SPEAKER_00]: shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you measure one and you can predict the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark and I just wrote a book chapter for
American Society of Agronomy on shortwave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that chapter talks about the
challenges of predicting one from the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in more detail than we've been
through here, but that's a forthcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: chapter about ratios of radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a really good point that,
you know, historically weather stations
[SPEAKER_01]: have never had quantum sensors on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quantum sensors have really only been in
existence since I guess the early 1970s,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they've only really been in widespread
use for maybe the past few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not common that you would find
a weather station that has a pyranometer
[SPEAKER_01]: on it to give you solar radiation and the
quantum sensor on it to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there could be, you know, applications
where you need to take weather stations,
[SPEAKER_01]: weather data from a weather station.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the pieces of information that
you need is the photosynthetically active
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Bruce is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually estimate
photosynthetically active radiation from
[SPEAKER_01]: pyranometer measurements of solar
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in doing that,
again grab my card and send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can provide you with some information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The model that allows you to calculate
photosynthetic photon flux from solar
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation measurements is pretty simple,
but there's some coefficients in there
[SPEAKER_01]: that can introduce some error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the coefficients are also dependent on
the sky conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in that or want
more detail, I'll gladly talk to you or
[SPEAKER_01]: just see me afterwards or grab my card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other comments or questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple, just a couple slides that
I'll mention UV briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do those now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think lunch was supposed to be 1230,
so we're about right on schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just chat about UV real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I actually failed to mention one
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're anxiously awaiting to get to
UV, we'll get there in one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot this last point on my slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually measure reflected
radiation using a single sensor if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I said before is you would have one
mounted like this that's level,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a second one mounted like this
that was level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you would do it if you wanted
to continuously measure it over the course
[SPEAKER_01]: of a growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to do this
instantaneously, you can actually take
[SPEAKER_01]: your sensor and measure it in this
position and then flip it upside down and
[SPEAKER_01]: measure it in this position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be careful when you do that that
during the time interval that it's here to
[SPEAKER_01]: here that the radiation doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you'll get an incorrect number
because the incoming number changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a clear sunny day, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Measure here, flip it over and level it,
and measure here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a day when it's intermittently
cloudy, you have to be really careful
[SPEAKER_01]: doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably wouldn't recommend it because
the clouds can actually change the
[SPEAKER_01]: incoming radiation very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a sensor, and maybe we can
even do this at lunch if you're interested
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think it kind of is
intermittently cloudy to day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go plug this USB sensor into a
computer and you can watch how dynamic the
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation is on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes rapidly and sometimes by large
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's cloudy, especially
intermittently cloudy, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure here and then flip it over and
measure here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be confident the background or
the incoming radiation stays the same if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using the same sensor and then
invert it because the measurements are
[SPEAKER_01]: separated by time.
Music.
