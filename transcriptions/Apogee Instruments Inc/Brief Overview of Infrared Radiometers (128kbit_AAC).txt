[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments, and today we'd like to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a brief overview of how we measure
surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is non-contact surface
temperature, so it's done with Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joined in this effort by Mark
Blonquist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I have worked together on this for
many, many years to refine this
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a powerful measurement and yet quite
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I especially want to do in this
talk is describe what the Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments sensor does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is with the sensor compared to
much lower cost sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little one that you can buy these
for under $100.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference in research grade
and hobby grade?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a lot like taking a picture
with your cell phone camera, versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional grade camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you need accurate measurements,
you need research grade sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are seven things in here that I'm
going to quickly go through that establish
[SPEAKER_00]: a research grade sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one obviously is accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And accuracy isn't just a matter of simple
accuracy, because if this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the sensor and the
target, any sensor can typically get that
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sensor is 75 degrees Fahrenheit or
77 Fahrenheit or 25 C and the target is
[SPEAKER_00]: also 77 or 25 C, it's not that hard to
measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now try to measure a hot surface or a very
cold surface with a cheaper sensor and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have significant error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the temperature difference down
here, temp diff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to put plus 30 degrees C
and over here we're going to put minus 30
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees C and this is the error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a zero error.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a low cost or a hobby grade
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The error looks like that and these errors
up here can be five degrees C as these
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures reach the extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how good is an Apogee sensor?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee sensor comes in right along
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The accuracy specification for Apogee is
plus or minus 0.2 degrees C and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: over the entire temperature range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an enormous difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just do this and they say,
well this is almost as good as the Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but you haven't tested it in extreme
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accuracy is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these sensors, if we put a sensor
right here, have a cone-shaped field of
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Draw it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A low-cost sensor has an enormous field of
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sees the edges, it sees the sky,
it sees the ground, it averages
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really wanted to average
everything, that'd be fine, but typically
[SPEAKER_00]: what you really want to see is a small
area in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Apogee sensors have variable fields
of view, but they're typically much tinier
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the type of sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can pinpoint the temperature of a
spot rather than average a big area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes a big change in the signal and
it's one of the reasons that Apogee's
[SPEAKER_00]: worked hard to get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the Apogee sensors have a
rectangular field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's multiple options for field of
view, but that's a big difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: low-cost and research-grade sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, spectral sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a graph of long wave radiation and
that typically goes from about 4,000
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers, and there's a broken axis
here, all the way out to 100,000
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiation from a typical black body
looks something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A low-cost sensor integrates all of this,
which would be okay, except there are huge
[SPEAKER_00]: windows in here where water vapor in the
air absorbs radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a low-cost sensor partly measures the
air temperature and partly measures the
[SPEAKER_00]: target temperature, particularly as you
get farther away from the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this reason, Apogee sensors,
and I'm going to show this in green,
[SPEAKER_00]: measure only what's called the atmospheric
window, ATMOS window.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this range right here, water vapor does
not interfere with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air is transparent when you use a
research-grade Apogee sensor because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're limited to this window right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's a smaller signal,
so it's harder to measure, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important not to measure the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four, response time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is time here,
[SPEAKER_00]: signals can look like this, a cheaper
signal, and it's a lot of noise if and
[SPEAKER_00]: this might be plus one degree and minus
one degree and zero is right here in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this signal is bouncing around,
what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a running average, and I'll show
that in here in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have a running average that
looks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's much more accurate, but you have to
wait to get your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to leave it on there for several
seconds to average this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee sensors have much smaller noise
over time, so they don't need to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: running average.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make measurements over short time
intervals, much faster response time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many applications, that's critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a complex topic, but if this is a
surface, say the ground, not all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation coming off the ground is
emitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, for many surfaces, we'll say
90% is emitted, and this is a parameter
[SPEAKER_00]: called usually a lowercase e.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a surface like this, what happens to
the other 10%?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's averaging, in this room,
it'd be averaging the ceiling temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: with the floor temperature, and it's
weighted to the floor temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheaper sensors don't account for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee mathematically can account for this
and correct for problems with emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about this in a more
detailed seminar, but this can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: significant errors if it's not properly
corrected for in the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee sensors allow for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number six, durability.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sensor like this is not designed for
continuous outdoor field use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The apogee sensors are designed for year
after year measurements in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make the investment in a good
sensor, you sure want it to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want it to work reliably through
harsh weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seventh and final one is the
output of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get the signal accurately to a
data logger, so this is shielded twisted
[SPEAKER_00]: pair cable with multiple output options.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes with SDI-12 options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soon to come with Modbus options,
Bluetooth options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many ways to get the signal from
this to a data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheaper sensors read it on the sensor,
but that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are seven reasons that research
grade sensors give you better accuracy and
[SPEAKER_00]: better long-term stability than the much
lower cost sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
Good luck.
Good luck.
