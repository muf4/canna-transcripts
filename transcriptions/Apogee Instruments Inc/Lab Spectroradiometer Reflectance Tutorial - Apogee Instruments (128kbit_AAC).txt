[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is John Huber and in this
video we'll be going over a quick set of
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions on how to set up a laboratory
spectral radiometer for reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for these reflectance measurements
you're going to need a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need obviously your
spectral radiometer, the computer that
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll interface with, a reflectance
standard, a stable light source,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my case I am going to use a reflectance
probe with a flashlight built into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the unit's fiber optic cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as far as reflectance standards go,
I've got a sheet of spectral on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same material as our AS004
reflectance standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this material reflects all light within
the spectral radiometer's sensitivity
[SPEAKER_00]: range and so it'll work very well as a
light reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step to setting up your
spectral radiometer will be first to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you've got StellarNet SpectralWiz
installed and working on your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that you're going to want to make
sure your spectral radiometer is plugged
[SPEAKER_00]: in, which mine is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that the next step will be
to plug in the fiber optic cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll want to note the end that says
it plugs into the spectral radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a little arrow pointing to where
the spectral radiometer should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go ahead and plug that end
in first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're just using the fiber
optic cable for your reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, you'll want to position it
in a fixed position for the duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: your measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case I'm going to put it into this
reflectance probe here, which will also
[SPEAKER_00]: serve as my light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that you have a stable
light source throughout your measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got everything hooked up,
the next thing you'll want to do is start
[SPEAKER_00]: up SpectralWiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, we do recommend that you
run it as an administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go ahead and navigate to
its install directory on the C drive,
[SPEAKER_00]: Program Files, StellarNet, SpectralWiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the executable is this swd file.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to right click it and run it as
an administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing this makes sure the program has the
privileges that it needs to function
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise Windows is going to create some
false files in another directory that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll need to delete for the program to
work right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got StellarNet SpectralWiz
running, you're going to want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in scope mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So select view and scope mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you've got that set up,
you'll want to make sure your light source
[SPEAKER_00]: is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to turn the little flashlight
in my probe here on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to position your
fiber optic cable over your reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: standard target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you've got it positioned over the
target, your next step is to optimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: integration time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're optimizing the integration
time, your goal is to make sure that this
[SPEAKER_00]: graph here occupies as much of the Y axis
here as possible without cutting off at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now the graph is too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you what it looks like
when it's too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go view, now you go setup,
detector integration time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make the graph go higher,
you simply increase this integration time
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it go lower, you decrease it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to increase it by too much
just as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, the graph is cutting
off slightly at the top here, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: my integration time is too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to bring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go setup, detector integration
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bring it down a little bit to
1450 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your integration time is going to vary
depending on the brightness of your light
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brighter the light source,
the lower your integration time will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, this integration time
looks like it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's occupying a good portion of the Y
axis, but it's not being cut off at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to let it sit for a while
to make sure it's stable, which it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it's stable, your next step is to
obtain a dark scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key to obtaining a good dark scan
is just to make sure that there's no light
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into your spectral radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this procedure, I'm going to unplug
the fiber optic cable and then cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: opening port.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do this, you should see a
nice flat line at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK if there are some tiny bumps in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to flatten those out with the
dark scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I prefer to release old dark scans
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is optional, but usually it leads to
better dark scans overall in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to release an old dark scan,
you'll want to right click this button
[SPEAKER_00]: here with the dark scan icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you'll notice that a
small square forms in the lower left
[SPEAKER_00]: corner of the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the old dark scan has been
erased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're ready to save a new dark
scan, just left click the button here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the line is nice and flat
along the bottom, and the value down here
[SPEAKER_00]: is bouncing very close to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll vary by a bit, but it should always
remain close to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've got a good dark scan,
I'm going to plug the fiber optic cable
[SPEAKER_00]: back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to replace the probe
over their standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to make sure that our
integration time still looks good,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it still occupies most of the y-axis
here, so that's still a good integration
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got your dark scan and your
integration time set, the next thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do is go into transmission mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go View, Transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the next step after that is simply
to click this light reference button here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will establish your reflectance
standard as the standard for 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, you are now ready to
start taking reflectance measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to take a quick
measurement off of the black tabletop
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the black tabletop is
absorbing most of the visible spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is beginning to reflect the far red
spectrum beyond 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanometers, which we'd expect to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have a good spectrum,
and you're satisfied with it, and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to save it, you go up to File,
Save, Sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll pick a location to save your file
and give it a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call this one Test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this window comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to define your starting
wavelength, your ending wavelength,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your wavelength increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this file, I'm going to just keep the
starting and ending wavelengths and then
[SPEAKER_00]: change the wavelength increments to one
nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've done that, you click OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your spectrum is saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if you want to open your spectrum
up in a program like Microsoft Excel,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you need to do is open up Excel,
click File, Open, browse to the location
[SPEAKER_00]: where you saved your file, and then you
want to make sure that Excel is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for all files and not just Excel files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your file and open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to make sure it's
delimited by spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click Finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's our spectrum file.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that concludes the brief tutorial on
how to take a reflectance measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
