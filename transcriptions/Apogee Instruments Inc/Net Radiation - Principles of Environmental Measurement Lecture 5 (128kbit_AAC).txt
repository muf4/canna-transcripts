[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about net radiation,
specifically the four components and then
[SPEAKER_01]: selection among sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce will talk a bit about radiation
frost and non-destructive measurements of
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf chlorophyll and then I'll talk about
hyperspectory reflectance and if we get
[SPEAKER_01]: that far and if people are interested we
can speak a bit about soil oxygen and
[SPEAKER_01]: barometric pressure but we'll just see
where we're at after we get to the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the reflectance stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay yeah as long as interest is still
there people's eyes are open at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright so as before if you have any
questions please feel free to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that many slides this time I
might make use of the of the board and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of what we've covered already when we
talked about pyranometers and infrared
[SPEAKER_01]: radiometers relates directly to net
radiometers, the instruments that we use
[SPEAKER_01]: to measure net radiation and so we won't
talk maybe as much about principles of
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors in the in the net radiation
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So net radiation is just the difference
between incoming radiation at the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: and outgoing radiation at the surface and
there are both short wave and long wave
[SPEAKER_01]: components that we have to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I passed out a magnet if you don't have
one there's more down here and you're free
[SPEAKER_01]: to take one that has the exact same
picture that you that you see right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are typical values of the four
different components that make up net
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be representative of a clear
summer day over vegetation near solar noon
[SPEAKER_01]: so when the Sun is in the middle of the
sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the largest component of net radiation
is the incoming shortwave component 100
[SPEAKER_01]: watts per meter squared is a reasonable
value for midday in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the vegetation or soil whatever is at
the surface in the summertime usually it's
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation is a good absorber of shortwave
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a much smaller amount is being
reflected about 200 watts per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared is a good estimate for vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the difference between these two the
incoming shortwave minus the outgoing
[SPEAKER_01]: shortwave is net shortwave so we have a
positive value of 800 watts per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared net shortwave at the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a term that you're probably all
familiar with is albedo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the the broadband shortwave
reflectivity and so essentially it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: the ratio of these two numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our example would be 200 divided by
1000 so it's the reflected shortwave
[SPEAKER_01]: divided by the incoming shortwave.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be 0.2 or 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really reasonable value for green
vegetation when the Sun is in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we switch over to the longwave side we
also have an incoming longwave component
[SPEAKER_01]: and an emitted longwave component.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the sky is cloud free and a lot of
you are just outside with me pointing
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared sensors up and measuring the sky
was quite cold but we found that the
[SPEAKER_01]: clouds were a bit warmer than the blue
sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sky is emitting longwave radiation
towards the surface and the surface is
[SPEAKER_01]: emitting longwave radiation back towards
the sky but the reason the incoming
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation from the sky is lower than the
emitted radiation from the surface is the
[SPEAKER_01]: sky is colder than the ground surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it typically always is in the
summertime especially if the sky is clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's cloudy they can be pretty close
and these numbers can be a lot closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were to actually take the
measurements that we are making outside I
[SPEAKER_01]: think a lot of us were seeing like
negative 20 negative 30 Celsius for the
[SPEAKER_01]: sky temperature that we were measuring
with those infrared sensors and we put
[SPEAKER_01]: that temperature in the Stefan-Boltzmann
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just write that over here on the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in an early slide but just to
remind
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone so energy is equal to a constant
that we use a sigma times the absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature raised to the fourth power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were to take one of our
measurements outside we'll just say the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue sky was negative 30 Celsius and we
were to plug it into this equation we
[SPEAKER_01]: would get a number that's a lot lower than
300 watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is those infrared
radiometers we were using outside they're
[SPEAKER_01]: only measuring the wavelengths between 8
and 14 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember from the infrared
presentation that I gave this morning when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're trying to measure temperature we
have to have sensors that have a filter
[SPEAKER_01]: over them that only gives us 8 to 14
micron because that's the atmospheric
[SPEAKER_01]: window where the sensor can effectively
see through the atmosphere to the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're trying to measure the
temperature of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're trying to measure net
radiation we don't want the 8 to 14 micron
[SPEAKER_01]: filter on our long wave radiation sensors
because we're trying to measure all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation coming from either the
atmosphere or the land surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not that interested in the
temperature in other words and we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to see through the atmosphere and
measure the cold temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to actually capture the radiation
coming from the air molecules and the
[SPEAKER_01]: clouds and everything that's in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long wave sensors don't have an 8 to 14
micron sensor on them like the infrared
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature sensor does and that's why if
we were to plug in negative 30 Celsius
[SPEAKER_01]: here we would wouldn't get 300 watts per
meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what negative 30 Celsius
is when we plug it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: Stefan-Boltzmann equation but it's a lot
closer to like 150 or 200 watts per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said the sky when we're talking
about all of the long wave wavelengths the
[SPEAKER_01]: sky is still colder than the ground
surface and so there's less long wave
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in from the sky than what's being
emitted from the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this example the net long wave
radiation is negative 150 watts per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared and so net radiation then is just
the sum of these two numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Net short wave plus net long wave gives us
net radiation that's 650 watts per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared and essentially that's what our
equation here says.
[SPEAKER_01]: The symbol we use for short wave is short
wave SW and then subscript I for incoming,
[SPEAKER_01]: subscript O for outgoing, symbol for long
wave is LW, same subscripts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any ideas of what these values will look
like for the winter over snow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has the magnet but don't cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say it loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly right so you're going to get a lot
greater reflectance here because it's snow
[SPEAKER_01]: on the surface instead of vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The albedo of snow is often around 0.7 or
0.8 if the snow is kind of old and dirty
[SPEAKER_01]: or like 0.8 to even 0.9 if the snow is
fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really reflective.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does this one change?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there's going to be greater
reflected radiation but how does this one
[SPEAKER_01]: change in the winter?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah but you're cheating you've got the
magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: No I'm kidding I'm kidding it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all know that the seasons change
right and the reason the seasons change is
[SPEAKER_01]: because the Sun angles get much lower in
the winter versus summer and so this
[SPEAKER_01]: number gets a lot lower just because the
Sun is at a much lower angle it's winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this guy is lower we have less
overall short wave coming in but we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: much larger reflected component because we
have snow on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about these two?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they change in winter time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember these ones are dependent on
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah exactly it's colder in the winter
than it is in the summer so that the sky
[SPEAKER_01]: gets a little bit colder and this number
gets smaller but not a lot but the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: actually gets a lot colder and so this
number gets quite a bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now if we look at and everybody has the
magnet reasonable values for the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter in the middle of the day over a
snow covered surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incoming shortwave is only about 40% of
what it is in the summer 400 watts per
[SPEAKER_01]: meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reflected component is a lot bigger
because the snow has a high albedo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody that can do math in their head
what's 350 divided by 400 that's about
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.85 roughly I think yeah 0.875 right so
the albedo in this example is almost 90%
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a high reflectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can see the incoming long wave
from the sky does go down a little bit but
[SPEAKER_01]: not as much as the outgoing long wave from
the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially in the winter time the sky
temperature and the surface temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: are closer to the same value and they're
both cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our net shortwave here is positive 50
our net long wave there is negative 50 and
[SPEAKER_01]: so the net radiation is actually zero in
this example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is true of the middle of the
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about at night what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially the yellow arrows and the
yellow numbers go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have long wave at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we only have long wave at night that
means net radiation is a negative number
[SPEAKER_01]: at night and that's why it cools off a lot
at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: The surface is now losing energy to the
atmosphere rather than gaining energy as
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that we are interested in
measuring net radiation is it's a major
[SPEAKER_01]: driver of surface processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of just explained one heating and
cooling but another one is
[SPEAKER_01]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in many cases net radiation is the
biggest driver or the biggest contributor
[SPEAKER_01]: to evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vapor pressure deficit which Bruce talked
about a lot this morning is another one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the major drivers of evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of reasons that net
radiation could be applicable especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in environmental and ecological studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's a slide showing the surface
energy balance and here's a simple surface
[SPEAKER_01]: energy balance equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Net radiation is a major component and so
we won't consider the radiation terms in
[SPEAKER_01]: too much detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were on the previous slide but you've
got incoming short wave streams and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the outgoing the reflected short wave
streams and long wave radiation coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from clouds and sky whatever is in the sky
that has a temperature is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: emitting long wave radiation towards the
surface and then plants and soil whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: is at the surface is going to be emitting
radiation back towards the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The G term is the the soil heat flux so
the flux of energy into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: The H term is the sensible heat flux the
heat gain or loss due to conduction and
[SPEAKER_01]: convection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually is heat loss during the day
because often the surface is warmer than
[SPEAKER_01]: the air but not always the surface can be
colder than the air so there can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible heat flux towards the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the LE term is the the latent
heat loss which is the combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporation and transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are other terms like
photosynthesis would be a small
[SPEAKER_01]: contributor and there can be heat storage
in the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically heat storage doesn't happen in
crops but can in forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just defined those but here's the
real point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The available energy and we call the
difference between net radiation and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: heat flux as available energy because
that's everything that's available to do
[SPEAKER_01]: things like evaporate water or heat the
surface for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We often find when we make measurements of
all of these terms like at eddy covariance
[SPEAKER_01]: sites for example when we can measure
sensible heat flux and latent heat flux
[SPEAKER_01]: with gas analyzers and sonic anemometers
we often find that the available energy is
[SPEAKER_01]: not balanced by the heat fluxes at many
measurement sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be the energy coming in should
equal the energy going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the real point is net radiation
measurements have to be accurate for
[SPEAKER_01]: surface energy balance studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk a bit about net radiometers
and I'll also talk a little bit about net
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation modeling because earlier we were
talking many routine weather stations that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have like weather networks they're
going to have a pyranometer on there to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure the incoming shortwave radiation
but a lot of times they don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: other radiometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were talking about photosynthetic
radiation earlier they typically don't
[SPEAKER_01]: weather stations typically don't have PAR
sensors on them to measure the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetically active radiation and
they often don't have a net radiometer on
[SPEAKER_01]: there to measure net radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can model net radiation from incoming
shortwave radiation and I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: that in addition to measurements of net
radiation with net radiometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four kinds of net radiometers
and I'll start with the most complex and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'll move to the simplest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time you don't see too many of
the intermediate types of net radiometers
[SPEAKER_01]: usually there's four component instruments
which are the most complex and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: quite common or there's single component
instruments which are the simplest and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're quite common.
[SPEAKER_01]: A four component net radiometer has an
individual sensor for measuring the four
[SPEAKER_01]: components that we just described.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got an upward looking
pyranometer that measures the incoming
[SPEAKER_01]: shortwave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a downward looking pyranometer
that measures the reflected shortwave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got an upward looking pergeometer
that measures the incoming longwave and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a downward looking pergeometer
that measures the emitted longwave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyranometer is the name of the sensor for
shortwave radiation measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pergeometer, kind of a funny word,
is the name of the sensor for measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: the longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very similar instruments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them consist of a thermopile
detector and Bruce talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: thermopiles pyranometers earlier today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially it's a device that measures
the heat difference across the top surface
[SPEAKER_01]: and the bottom surface of the plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then over top of the thermopile there's a
black body absorber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the black body is just used to absorb
all of the incident radiation on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyranometers have a glass dome over top of
the thermopile and black body detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for the glass dome is twofold.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to give it accurate cosine or
angular response and the other is to block
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a pyranometer we're only interested
in the shortwave wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: The glass is only transmissive to
shortwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to put a glass dome over top of
the black body so that it blocks the
[SPEAKER_01]: longwave, lets the shortwave through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore the black body will only absorb
the shortwave and the thermopile will only
[SPEAKER_01]: measure the shortwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the downward looking pyranometer is the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just inverted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of them that's mounted upside
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pergeometer is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is instead of having a
glass dome it has a silicon dome over top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the black body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I've drawn here doesn't look
like a dome shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the pergeometers will have a
small dome shape, other times it'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: be a flat surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually a silicon window rather
than a dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that we use a silicon dome
is because it blocks the shortwave
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation and transmits the longwave
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pergeometer is designed to measure
longwave.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to block the shortwave and allow
only the longwave through so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: black body absorber can absorb it and the
thermopile can measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here again you've got one up,
one down to measure the short and
[SPEAKER_01]: longwave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some examples of this type of net
radiometer are the Huxaflux, that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both build four component instruments
that work very well and I'll show you some
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apogee Instruments also builds one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have a good demo to show
you but I will pass this around so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see what an instrument actually looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this sensor here with the white
diffuser on the top is the upward looking
[SPEAKER_01]: pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just said they typically have
glass domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one doesn't have a glass dome,
it has an acrylic diffuser which is also
[SPEAKER_01]: transmissive to the shortwave wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom pyranometer is a glass window,
that's this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two pergeometers have flat black
windows that are made of silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look the same up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to have a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: For these ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Huxaflux is probably, these numbers
are going to be in US dollars so I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what they would be in Australian
dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The equivalent one made in Australia is
about $6,000 or $7,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so yeah that's correct, Middleton
building ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you the designs of these
things haven't changed since I did my PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a plastic thing here and you've
got to pass air through the whole bit to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the dome up, keep the condensation
out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first one, I know this is not
a commotion to lift in an Apogee workshop
[SPEAKER_02]: though, this is the first one since I did
a PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever seen it become a realistic price
that will actually work in the field that
[SPEAKER_02]: you haven't almost seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the price of the Apogee one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it hasn't been officially
released.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I can say the price, Peter's the
one who sells it in Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the US list price is about $2,500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, but you also have to pay for
importation and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Kippen zoning unit is about $6,000 I
think, maybe a little higher because it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes with a heater and ventilator on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Huxaflux unit is closer to $5,000,
I think it's between $4,500 and $5,000 US
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you an idea of the price tag of
these sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a relative sense I'll compare the price
of all of the above because we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: put three more pictures like this one on
the slide here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next type is a net all wave radiometer
and this one is the simplest version.
[SPEAKER_01]: You basically have one thermal pile and
it's sandwiched between two black body
[SPEAKER_01]: absorbers, one on top and one on bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two polyethylene domes over top of
the absorbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you have is a thermal pile that's
just outputting a signal that's
[SPEAKER_01]: proportional to the temperature difference
between the top surface and the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: That temperature difference between the
top surface and the bottom surface is
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on the radiation incident on the
top and the radiation incident on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason this is called a net all wave
radiometer is that it's measuring each
[SPEAKER_01]: surface, the upward looking surface and
the downward looking surface, are
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring all of the wavelengths at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sensitive to short wave and long wave
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polyethylene actually transmits short wave
and long wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for the polyethylene domes is
just to basically be a weather barrier and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep rain and moisture and dust and dirt
off of the black body surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of these net all wave radiometers
have polyethylene domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the most common one, at least
historically, is this REBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: REBS stands for radiation and energy
balance systems, model Q star 7.1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an American made instrument from
the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used a lot, especially in past
decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it seems like the Kippenzone and
NR-Lite II is the most common type of
[SPEAKER_01]: these net all wave radiometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The REBS has the polyethylene domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kippenzone and NR-Lite II does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real challenge of polyethylene domes
is they're flimsy and you have to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them pressurized off in order for them to
not collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, polyethylene is better
at transmitting short wave than it is at
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitting long wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get different proportions of long
wave and short wave, say clear sky versus
[SPEAKER_01]: cloudy sky, for example, or over
vegetation versus over snow, it can really
[SPEAKER_01]: influence the accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The polyethylene domes, while they can
keep it clean and free of water,
[SPEAKER_01]: they also have their challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be replaced quite often
because they're flimsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birds like to peck holes in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kippenzone and NR-Lite, in doing away
with the polyethylene domes, they get
[SPEAKER_01]: around at least part of the problem of the
domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, when the surfaces get
wet, the radiation balance goes way out of
[SPEAKER_01]: whack and they don't yield accurate
measurements until they're dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ones, while they're the simplest and
the cheapest, also are the most prone to
[SPEAKER_01]: errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just talked about prices for all of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are probably $1,500 to $2,000
US, somewhere in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't spend nearly as much time on these
two intermediate types just because this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the only example of this type of
two-component instrument that I'm aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's no longer available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works a lot like this one, where you
have a single thermopile that's measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: the net difference between what's coming
in and what's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that we separate short wave and
long wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have two components.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is measuring net short wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is measuring net long wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a nice instrument when it was
available, but it didn't last very long on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other type is also kind of like that
one, but rather than being a net device
[SPEAKER_01]: that only gives you one signal that's
proportional to the difference between all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the incoming radiation and all of the
outgoing radiation, is that they separate
[SPEAKER_01]: the pi radiometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got an upward looking one that's
sensitive to both the incoming short wave
[SPEAKER_01]: and the incoming long wave, and then a
downward looking one that's sensitive to
[SPEAKER_01]: both the outgoing short wave and the
outgoing long wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good example of this one is the Philipp
Schenck model 8111.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a European instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it comes from Germany,
maybe Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is not a very widely used
instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Predominantly you'll see this or that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I had some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what they all look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Huxaflux in the kip and then the
Apogee that I passed around the room is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major advantages of a four component
net radiometer is that you get an
[SPEAKER_01]: individual measurement of each one of the
four components.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a major advantage because typically
that gives you higher accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say potentially here because four
individual sensors also means you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: four components that might cause problems
like if one of them isn't calibrated
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly that can be a problem or you've
got four of them that might get dirty for
[SPEAKER_01]: example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we already talked about price.
[SPEAKER_01]: These tend to be higher cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one design feature that I will
mention with regards to the Apogee is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it has an SDI-12 output.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get around this need for all of those
data logger channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this means is in the center box here
on the Apogee unit, there's a circuit
[SPEAKER_01]: board in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the outputs from the individual
radiometers are being measured by the
[SPEAKER_01]: analog to digital converter on that
internal circuit board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're just digitizing those signals
and outputting an SDI-12 measurement so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can plug it into one single
digital channel on your data logger and
[SPEAKER_01]: not have to tie up all of the analog
channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if we look at the net all wave
radiometers, here's the two examples that
[SPEAKER_01]: I listed in the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the polyethylene domes and that
one's the domeless model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, these domes, they're better at
transmitting short wave than they are long
[SPEAKER_01]: wave which can lead to errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't always stay inflated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they get a hole in them, they'll get
water condensing on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can cause big problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Domes need to be replaced periodically.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, because they're domeless,
they're exposed to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get wet and dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main advantages here are it only
requires one data logger channel to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, it's a single detector where the
signal that it's outputting is
[SPEAKER_01]: proportional to the difference between
everything that's coming in and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that only requires one analog
measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: These do tend to be smaller and lighter
weight so they can be easier to mount to
[SPEAKER_01]: the level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we already talked about price.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to be lower cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the major disadvantages, they have
fragile domes and they're domeless.
[SPEAKER_01]: This domeless guy requires a wind speed
correction because if the wind's blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: over top of it, it can change the energy
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have mismatched detectors,
that can be a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially what that means is you only
have a single sensor and you've got one
[SPEAKER_01]: detector surface on the top side of that
sensor or thermopile and one detector
[SPEAKER_01]: surface on the bottom side of that
thermopile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have the same sensitivity to
short wave and long wave and they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the same sensitivity to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, they're only accurate for the
conditions that they're calibrated to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the conditions are changing like they
do in a dynamic environment, then the
[SPEAKER_01]: mismatched detectors, so the upward
sensitivity doesn't match the downward
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity, can lead to errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to be higher maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you have to replace the domes
and all of the above combined lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: lower accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a summary slide and I'll
mention that a few years ago, before
[SPEAKER_01]: Apogee started building net radiometers,
we were interested in potentially selling
[SPEAKER_01]: net radiometers from other companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did an extensive field study where we
compared several different models of net
[SPEAKER_01]: radiometers for part of the growing season
over a uniform turf grass field in Logan,
[SPEAKER_01]: Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the citation to our work is here if
you're interested in getting the paper
[SPEAKER_01]: again, shoot me an email and I will send
you a PDF.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the major findings are that the four
component net radiometers did indeed
[SPEAKER_01]: provide the most accurate measurements,
but I put an if in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make sure that the radiometer
is level and you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: the individual sensors are clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The net all-wave radiometers were the
simplest, but they did have lower accuracy
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was due to lower sensitivity to
long wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last line I think is important,
we found that net radiometers were capable
[SPEAKER_01]: of measuring net radiation with better
accuracy than what's often reported in the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a few studies out there like
energy balance studies, especially at flux
[SPEAKER_01]: tower sites, that indicate net radiation
uncertainty is like 10 or 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you're measuring it with a four
component net radiometer that's well
[SPEAKER_01]: leveled and clean, then the uncertainty is
probably lower than what's usually
[SPEAKER_01]: reported in the literature for net
radiation measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions about measuring net
radiation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just take a minute, I don't have any
slides for this, but I think I can make
[SPEAKER_01]: use of the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not even need to make use of the
board, I think I can just explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that are interested in
modeling net radiation, again we can talk
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards or you can send me a follow-up
email and I can give you more detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those cases when you have weather data
and you need net radiation but the weather
[SPEAKER_01]: data did not include a net radiometer to
measure the net radiation, you can model
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important component that you need
is a measurement of the incoming shortwave
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation from a pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at your fridge magnet or
if you remember my first slide,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually the largest component of net
radiation is the incoming shortwave
[SPEAKER_01]: component from the Sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have that measurement, you have at
least a reasonable idea of net radiation
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can model the other components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically how it's done is then to take a
published value of albedo for the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's vegetation it's going to be pretty
low around 0.2 to maybe 0.25.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's snow it's going to be quite a bit
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Published values of albedo are fairly
accurate if the surface conditions don't
[SPEAKER_01]: change dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to do this when the
vegetation is always green, just
[SPEAKER_01]: estimating or taking a published value of
the albedo and calculating the reflected
[SPEAKER_01]: shortwave component that way works pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is if you're trying to do
this over the course of say a whole year
[SPEAKER_01]: when you might have snow or bare soil in
the winter time and then the crops start
[SPEAKER_01]: to come up and you have green vegetation
and soil mixture and then the crops fill
[SPEAKER_01]: in and you only have green vegetation for
the most of the growing season and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the crops a nest and they turn yellow and
then you harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The surface can be quite dynamic over the
course of a whole year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only use values of albedo if you
know what it is for the surface or have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good estimate of it and if it's not
changing significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the surface is changing a lot then you
have to change the albedo in your model.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that longwave is often estimated
is from measurements of air temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can predict longwave pretty well
from equations like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Stefan-Boltzmann equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emitted energy is proportional to a
constant times the fourth power of
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we know reasonably well what the fourth
power of temperature is for the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: then we can estimate longwave relatively
well, the components being emitted because
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that most surfaces are black
bodies, most land surfaces are black
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're working with plant canopies or
soil or snow, the emissivity right there
[SPEAKER_01]: in the equation, this number is going to
be close to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have a reasonable estimate of the
surface temperature we can estimate the
[SPEAKER_01]: emitted longwave component, so the part
that's going from the ground to the
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere from this equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: To estimate the incoming longwave
component we use the exact same equation
[SPEAKER_01]: and oftentimes we use the air temperature
as a proxy for the sky temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge with doing incoming longwave
radiation estimates is this number is the
[SPEAKER_01]: hard one and you were asking about that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ways to estimate the emissivity
for the atmosphere and that's where the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity measurement comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually empirical equations that
estimate atmospheric emissivity based on
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes air temperature but typically
the vapor pressure of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air can be kind of high because
atmospheric emissivity is not always that
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on the vapor pressure near the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vapor pressure that we measure at the
surface typically comes from a relative
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity probe that might be two meters
off the ground but the longwave radiation
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from the sky is coming from the
whole depth of atmosphere from two meters
[SPEAKER_01]: above the ground till way up in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the near surface vapor pressure is
reasonable estimate of the whole column of
[SPEAKER_01]: water in the atmosphere, then empirically
estimating atmospheric emissivity from
[SPEAKER_01]: near surface vapor pressure works okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the near surface vapor pressure is not
a good estimator of the whole column of
[SPEAKER_01]: water in the atmosphere, then the
empirical equations don't work that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ways to model net radiation if
it's not available but I would recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring it if you have the equipment to
do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in learning more
about how to model net radiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: please send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a bit of information in the
literature that's been published.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a really good study from about
2007 I think, maybe 2009 where some folks
[SPEAKER_01]: at USDA in the United States compared a
whole bunch of different incoming longwave
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation models and assessed the actual
accuracy relative to measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's all I have for net
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for watching.
