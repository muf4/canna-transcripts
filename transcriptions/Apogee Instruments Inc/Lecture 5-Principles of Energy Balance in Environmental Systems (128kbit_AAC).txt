[SPEAKER_00]: lecture number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we are finally moving past just
radiation into the next component of this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this outline we're at number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are complex lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we're half done but we're
really more like two-thirds or
[SPEAKER_00]: three-fourths done in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But transpiration all by itself,
as I said before we talked about doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that by subtraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't we just measure it directly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes, sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want to talk about is
how we can do transpiration as a direct
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first thing you run into when you,
we've simplified this thing because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got all this other stuff feeding into this
one number right here, is latent heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you hear those terms all the time and
it's easy to get them confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latent heat all always refers to
evaporation of water for cooling and
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible heat just means dry heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no water involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did we come up with these terms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't studied the etiology of them,
but sensible heat makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot objects cool, they get cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy to understand, so it's
sensible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latent heat the object sitting there and
you shine a much brighter light on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be sensible heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only changes temperature after the
water evaporates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water evaporates and then it cools so
it's latent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's after the fact, the cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps to keep these terms because you
get into this business and people quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: start throwing these terms around and you
want to keep up with the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these are governed by the exact
same basic principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flux is driving gradient by resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of latent heat, the flux is
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll put grams of water per meter
squared per second equals a dimensionless
[SPEAKER_00]: driving gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dG over resistance and the resistance
is the stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they closed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they open?
[SPEAKER_00]: How open are the stomates?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a ratio of these two things
that quantitatively determine
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then remember as soon as we do weight
of water through that 2.45 megajoules per
[SPEAKER_00]: liter that you're all remembering,
we get milliliters of water per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared per second or we get joules of
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensible heat, same thing, only we get
joules of cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the denominator here is delta T.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the temperature between the two
objects and similarly this is divided by
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only over here mostly this resistance is
how fast the wind is blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dominant factor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This resistance is how open the stomates
are to let the water vapor out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concepts are exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what we want to start with is this
driving gradient right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll erase that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me erase all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we calculate that driving gradient?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask most people they would say,
well duh, how easy is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people think this is relative
humidity on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the relative humidity is low stuff
evaporates faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's high evaporates slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gets back and forth for all kinds
of gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolute humidity is the absolute number
of water vapor molecules in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative is the ratio of how much water is
in the air divided by what it could hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the air is hot it can hold a lot of
water vapor and the relative humidity goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this room if we had a hundred water
vapor molecules and the humidity was 50%,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we heated up the room we would still
have a hundred water vapor molecules and
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity might be 10% because the air
could hold more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this distinction is critical in
intuitively understanding the driving
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way that I have seen to
explain this is a thing called the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychrometric chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you may have seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think maybe I don't have plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just I thought I had plenty you
could take two of these but one to write
[SPEAKER_00]: on one to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you type psychrometric chart on the
internet you're going to get hundreds and
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of versions of this chart in
metric units and old English units.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the standard chart for
standard temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The x-axis is air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes from minus 20 to plus 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've pretty much covered the
environmental range on this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind this little subsection right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on this for starters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows five parameters of water vapor
in the air and if you know any two of
[SPEAKER_00]: those five you can calculate the other
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't quite write on this screen but
I can draw it on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to simulate this and sometimes
the simulations good because it'll be more
[SPEAKER_00]: simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the basic chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these tick marks down here are air
temperature and almost always in practice
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the things you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you don't measure water vapor to
back calculate air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most the time you know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These curves here in the middle are
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these curve lines like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take an example where we know air
temperature and humidity and see what we
[SPEAKER_00]: can calculate from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say this room is 25 C and the
humidity is 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here this is Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go on this chart and find 30
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 25 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this important line is just a tiny bit
past the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tiny bit boldface and we go up,
up, up, up, up till we get to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there is the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you want to draw a dot where
those humidity and temperature intersect
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll draw it on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we go to the right in a straight
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me simplify this a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here and we find the tick mark on
the right hand side of the graph from this
[SPEAKER_00]: going right straight across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me see if I can do this right on
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 and 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go right straight across I'm getting
seven and I think that's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a little more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting seven and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them going right straight across.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what the units are of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolute humidity grams per kilogram of
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different unit than relative
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: At our elevation,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not on this chart, but at our
elevation at 1,500 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way this is a chart for our
elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for 1,500 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made this just for this class.
[SPEAKER_00]: One kilogram of air equals one cubic meter
of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also 7.5 grams per cubic meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only in Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea level, this is 1.2 kilograms per cubic
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This same chart is available for all
different elevations and they are very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I overlaid them on here, if you if you
looked at two you wouldn't be able to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lay them on top of each other you
can see little differences, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest differences is the density of the
air and this grams per kilogram is valid
[SPEAKER_00]: for all different elevations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much water vapor is in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we took a cubic meter of air and
condensed all the water out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: cubic meters pretty big, we'd only get 7.5
grams of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look carefully over here,
the second column is dew point
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I promised five things from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one, air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two is relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is absolute humidity, ABSHUM.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth one goes this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right from that point and it's where this
intersects, this curve right here and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you take that point and go down to the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature is listed both on this and
this, but this point right here is the dew
[SPEAKER_00]: point of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see, we're at number four,
dew point of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very big deal because this is
where water changes state from a gas to a
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are below the dew point,
the water is going to just keep condensing
[SPEAKER_00]: on that surface and actually until the
surface finally warms up, but that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: air conditioners work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a cold surface and the water
condenses, takes it out of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's above this point, water will never
condense on that surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we get for dew point here?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're following along 25 and 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, 30, looks like I'm getting about six,
seven maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six or seven degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that if we go straight across here?
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, maybe seven degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's call this six degrees C for
our example.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we take a can of soda or beer out
of the fridge and let it sit in this room?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the temperature of a refrigerator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, two, three, four degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is going to condense on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's below the dew point of the
air and after a few minutes it warms up
[SPEAKER_00]: and that water evaporates again and
there's no water condensing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the concept of dew point of the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get up in the morning of a cold winter
night and water is condensing on your
[SPEAKER_00]: windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because the window temperature is
below the dew point of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of leaves, they can get,
they can cool at night below the dew point
[SPEAKER_00]: and water condenses on leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bad news because bacteria go wild
when there's water condensed on leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our models make all these measurements
calculate dew point and particularly the
[SPEAKER_00]: dew point of the leaves and if water is
condensing, we send a red alert to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathologists and people and they
have disease forecasts based on the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of hours below the dew point of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's based on other measurements in a
calculated dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm going to come back to the value of
each of these parameters in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I promise five things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fifth one is shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tick marks on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: See these lines go in the opposite
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of everything, this we can go right up
here relative humidity is two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go right up here and this temperature
is the wet bulb temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these all go both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all, if you know this,
you go this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all double-ended arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what good is the wet bulb temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: This means the temperature that a wet
surface would get to in these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a wet dish rag, fully wet,
and it's evaporating like crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: how cold would it get?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if we can calculate wet bulb
from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 up to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go this way and it looks like the
wet bulb temperature is about 13.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13.5 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is a wet dish rag would
cool to 13.5 C and as long as it stayed
[SPEAKER_00]: wet, it would stay at this temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well-irrigated leaves could get to this
temperature too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they act like a wet dish rag,
they could cool to this and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature is 25 and a wet surface
would cool to roughly 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of cooling, but it's low
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can quickly run the model and say,
oh what would it be if it was 80% humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and all we have to do is go up to 80 up
here and now the wet bulb temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: something like 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much closer to air temperature and
the dew point is something like 21 if we
[SPEAKER_00]: move up here in this humidity line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the absolute humidity is a function of
both relative humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we want to calculate is not just
absolute humidity, but this driving
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient and the driving gradient is,
let me draw this right here in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of one stomate,
a giant stomate on the bottom of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we drew this the other day,
we had various cells out here and here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole leaf with all the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's two cells right here that are
called guard cells and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly like a port with ships going in
and out and these guard cells are always
[SPEAKER_00]: going back and forth to restrict the size
of this opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the driving gradient for humidity,
I'm going to put H, I could say AH,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me say AH, absolute humidity I inside
the leaf to absolute humidity in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is not difficult to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our instruments on it and usually
we're getting relative humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature going this way and inside the
data logger and we're calculating this
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know this one, how do we get
humidity inside the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that any leaf that is not wilted,
that is hydrated, is 100% relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be 99% but it's very close to
100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if we know leaf temperature,
and for this example let's say that the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf temperature, the air is 25,
we just did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say the leaf is 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: These happen to be at the exact same
temperature in this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can go from air temperature here
straight up to 100% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf is the same temperature so our
leaf right here, now EAF, is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go from the leaf over here and we
get a number for the absolute humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water vapor density inside that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can do that in this
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: well I'm right here, I can take the tick
mark right off of this, it's the same tick
[SPEAKER_00]: mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go over here straight across and I'm
getting 24.2 maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaf is 100% humidity, this line
right here is 100% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting 24.2 inside the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have, get rid of our 100%,
24.2 and the air is 7.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: This driving gradient is 24.2 minus 7.5
with units of grams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever this subtraction is,
exactly what is that 16 or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: 17, about 17 grams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the absolute of humidity inside
the leaf minus the absolute humidity air,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the driving gradient for
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what if the leaf starts to run out of
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit, it's not as well
hydrated, it can't keep up, it can't
[SPEAKER_00]: balance the energy by evaporating water,
the leaf gets hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the leaf gets three degrees
hotter than the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not wilted yet, it's just not,
the stalemates are starting to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can do 25, 26, 27, 28 degrees C,
still 100% humidity, now we're at 29
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the leaf if it heats up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hot leaf, not hot, warm leaf,
29 minus, and the air is still the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: 29 minus 7.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as the leaf gets hotter,
the driving gradient gets bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is possible for really wet leaves
to get below air temperature because that
[SPEAKER_00]: wet bulb, they might get all the way down
to the wet bulb, but even there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a gradient for transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this gradient for transpiration,
and I'm going to show this in red,
[SPEAKER_00]: is always this difference right here,
between 100% humidity in the leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever our point is here in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of computer programs to put
stuff in and calculate this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: free programs, psychometric programs,
you used to have to pay for them and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're free on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of those, you can use those all
day long and you don't see the graphical
[SPEAKER_00]: principles the way you get them with a
psychometric chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see the chart, you can understand
how these points move to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute humidity change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf cooling, air humidity, temperature
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the reason that absolute humidity
is such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I asked, we put a dish rag outside,
would that dish rag dry faster at 30
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees C and 80% humidity or at 5 degrees
C and 20% humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most people would say, well 20%
humidity, of course it's going to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 degrees C, 20%, there's our delta
humidity, 30 degrees C, we're off chart,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80%, we're over here, it's a bigger
gradient for drying at a warm temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: at 80% humidity than it is down here at a
low humidity and cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is real counterintuitive because
you got to think of the combination of air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity when we do
absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these principles, psychometric
principles, have been around for 100 years
[SPEAKER_00]: and this chart's been around for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worry that we're losing some of the
intuitive insights you can get from this
[SPEAKER_00]: chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have it and you see points on
this, you can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real simple, but to reiterate what
I just said, here's another handout that
[SPEAKER_00]: shows these points and two handouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just what I wrote on the board
with some formal definitions of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things and then a little diagram showing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get to teaching this to other
people, you can show them this page and
[SPEAKER_00]: then to further make sure you have it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did three worked out examples where you
have a couple different inputs and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the other parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, sometimes you know one,
sometimes you know another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how have we measured this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before we had computers and
electronic sensors, we had psychrometers
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a, you still can buy these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wet dry bulb psychrometer and it
doesn't take electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take a fast microprocessor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is two thermometers, one with a wet
shoelace over it and one with nothing and
[SPEAKER_00]: so nothing is dry bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the word bulb comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bulb of a thermometer,
a mercury or alcohol thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means air temperature and the wet
bulb means one that has a wick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference in temperature,
now we get two numbers and from this
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument we can calculate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: No computer, just one piece of paper and
this and we get the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's one key thing about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it pulls apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the accurate wet bulb temperature,
you have to have a fan blowing on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: fans take electricity and we don't really
want that so we do this and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: called sling psychrometers and I used to
see people with these in their back pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the people had carried around
slide rolls and they would whip this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: around and they'd aspirate it and now
let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell me the humidity of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 77, oh my this is in Fahrenheit,
but 77 is 25 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dry bulb is 25 and the wet bulb is
59 which is 15 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find 25 and wet bulb of 15 and tell me
the humidity of this room from your chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We guessed 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how close we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again that's these two lines here
intersecting and then the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this whole thing is nonlinear and
because this is all in the days before
[SPEAKER_00]: computers, this has a little slide rule on
it, tick marks and you can line up the wet
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry bulb and it will tell you the
humidity right on this in case you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just do this and these tick marks are
nonlinear because the relationships are
[SPEAKER_00]: nonlinear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a self-contained instrument to
do humidity and they come, boy you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: them big if you need precision work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was beginning in graduate school,
there were no good electronic humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would take thermocouples and we'd put a
shoelace on one and a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got wet bulb and dry bulb and that's
how we did humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a state-of-the-art measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the wet bulb would get dirty and you
had to clean it and it was complicated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's how we did humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being a collector of old instruments,
I've collected instruments to do this over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years and here's one of my beauties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should put this in the case here
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big reservoir, a wet wick and a dry wick
and a nonlinear slide rule to get humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: from the relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just slide the points around to
get humidity if you don't have a computer
[SPEAKER_00]: handy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then instructions on the back for owner's
manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: For how to use that instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people got better and we had
bimetallic strips for humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one with humidity and temperature
and the lines cross and this is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny miniature psychometric chart with the
needles are crossing and you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute humidity just from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of clever things that people
did in the days before we had computers
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course now slide rules are a
completely lost art, but you can still buy
[SPEAKER_00]: a psychometric slide rule where you get
wet and dry bulb and you put it in here
[SPEAKER_00]: and calculate the other humidity
parameters and calculate relative humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: from wet and dry bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is interesting because in the days
before computers, that's a linear kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: long, you could get a circular slide rule
and it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Line these two points up and line the tick
mark to get humidity and this you could
[SPEAKER_00]: carry in your back pocket for checking
humidity anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all fascinating instruments
based on the human ingenuity in the days
[SPEAKER_00]: before computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they dealt with nonlinear stuff like
this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the end of my instrument
demo on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's start putting numbers in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get this, let's see if we can put
numbers in this to get this because if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do this, we don't have to get it by
subtraction because we've shown with
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments we can do a pretty good job of
measuring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key for this is, this is leaf,
absolute humidity and air.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be accurate about this, we need to know
the leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do air temperature 100% minus air,
you can have significant errors in this
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do need to have leaf temperature in
this, but once we get this, then we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very accurate measurement of this driving
gradient, then the rest of it is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come back to this in a second
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me erase all of this because this
[SPEAKER_00]: by the way you can buy these specialized
for really cold temperatures and then
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion engineers buy them for really
hot temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: For like smoke stacks, they're way out
here, but this is the one for
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental engineers which we're
dealing with environmental temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a classic thing, a ratio of
driving gradient and resistance and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to have the units line up in this
thing if this is going to be a flux,
[SPEAKER_00]: an amount per unit area per unit time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has units grams per kilogram,
but it turns out every time you work this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you also have to have a correction for air
pressure because that changes the driving
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do, this is last 20 years,
is calculate a dimensionless driving
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would like to get this in a
dimensionless term that we can use to put
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers in this and to do that we have
this gradient right here expressed in W,
[SPEAKER_00]: water, vapor, pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of water in the air creates a
vapor pressure and we know that from PV,
[SPEAKER_00]: from beginning chemistry, if we know the
number of molecules in the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's directly proportional to those
pressure of those molecules in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see people talking about
humidity, you do not hear them talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, oh there was grams per kilogram in
the air, we talk about vapor pressure of
[SPEAKER_00]: the water in the air and this is a direct
relationship between number of molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: or weight and the pressure and the
pressure in SI units is kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would like to do is know the
absolute humidity expressed with units of
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure and that's why two things
on this, I think we can see them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here in addition to grams per
kilogram, which is intuitive, is vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure and that goes from zero and this
chart's three and a half, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this has units of kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a vapor pressure difference would be
the top number minus the bottom number,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the amount of water in the air
expressed as a vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that we can take this curve right
here, which is this same curve,
[SPEAKER_00]: only all it has on here is vapor pressure
and now this thing goes up to 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can you can calculate at some very
hot temperatures, really nonlinear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the equation to get this curve,
so we do this all in a computer and here
[SPEAKER_00]: is a table of values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do it by hand, examples looking
stuff up here and we'll convert our
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute humidity in grams per kilogram to
vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get, I'm going to estimate this,
well we don't even have to estimate,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do it pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, 30, right here, I go across,
I'm getting about one kilopascal,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the vapor pressure in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go up here, 25, cross and I get
3.12, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2 minus 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now converting units, we have 3.2 minus
1 and now the units are kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I didn't teach this right in the
beginning because a vapor pressure is not
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A weight per volume is intuitive,
but this converts to Pascals and here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the beauty of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water vapor pressure, our delta H in our
example, is 2.2
kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we would like to get a dimensionless
ratio that we can use at all elevations
[SPEAKER_00]: and all pressures, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ratio the pressure of the water in
the air to the total air pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We divide it by the total air pressure and
at our elevation, our average air
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, 2.2 divided by 86 kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This varies a little bit, high pressure
and low pressure, it might go from 85 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 87, it doesn't vary very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top of Mount Logan, I think it might be 60
kPa, but it varies a lot with elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: but high and low pressure fronts don't
change it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, somebody's going to have to do
this math for me, but it's what is it
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be, maybe 2.8, 2.2 divided by 86,
sorry, 0.0256.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go, 0.0256.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this doesn't have units, this is a
dimensionless ratio, kPa to kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the driving gradient for
photosynthesis regardless of elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've divided out by temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we got the same gradient,
there's an important point for living at
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we took these measurements and we
made them right out there at the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mount Logan and we got 2.2 kPa,
we did all our careful measurements and
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're at 60 kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that come out to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which place has faster transpiration
rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here everything's the same, right here
0.025, 0.036.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration is going to be significantly
faster at the top of Mount Logan than it
[SPEAKER_00]: is here in Logan for the exact same
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do this at sea level, it goes the
other direction, 2.2 and now sea level is
[SPEAKER_00]: 101 kPa average, so this is by 0.022,
so transpiration is less at sea level than
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes sense because water boils at
lower temperatures as you get a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration goes faster at lower
pressures too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our dimensionless driving
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the units for resistance are going to
be the same as the one over the units for
[SPEAKER_00]: flux, but when we express this now in all
the models, we don't use resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore even though I teach it that way
because it's a nice ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use conductance,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in electric terms it's just one over
the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the equations you see for driving
gradient for transpiration are,
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration equals delta H, it is a
dimensionless ratio, times G sub S,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower case G stands for model conductance
and the S is to model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is dimensionless, the units for
conductance are exactly the same as the
[SPEAKER_00]: units for transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might be grams per meter squared
per second, and this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensionless, times in this case grams
per meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: A unit for conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll talk about conductance in a
minute, but the key here is calculating
[SPEAKER_00]: this dimensionless number for
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you a worked out handout of
this, but I have a handout of typical
[SPEAKER_00]: values of these which helps because
obviously if this ratio goes up ten
[SPEAKER_00]: percent and the stomates don't change,
transpiration goes up ten percent and this
[SPEAKER_00]: we can measure with instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real hard to measure, but at least
we get this and we can start to estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration because all it is is two
numbers multiplied together.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have, oh so before I leave this,
yes here's the whole thing in saturation
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure and if you know this curve
and you know humidity and temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to do all these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads to equation to do it in a
computer in a spreadsheet and our data
[SPEAKER_00]: loggers are pre-programmed to do all this
stuff in them based on the endpoints
[SPEAKER_00]: because of these relationships,
but that's why we can do it all from that
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation vapor pressure curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical values, flux, driving gradient,
conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could line this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear better.
[SPEAKER_00]: HI inside the leaf, HA air, stomatal
conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some typical transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now transpiration is determined not by the
weight of the water, but by the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, so we go with moles of water
vapor rather than grams or milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are typical rates for a typical
well-watered leaf in three different units
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a range for those units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving gradients, we got two and this
here's typical and we calculated 0.0256,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's our typical gradient and
there's a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was zero, it'd mean a hundred
percent humidity, but this gradient can
[SPEAKER_00]: get enormous sometimes, really hot dry air
and here's typical units for stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far this whole thing is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we can nail this number,
we can't get transpiration until we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of this, so you can do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put in some typical values for
this and calculate this, which is over
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, by the way, is all for a single
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for a community of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly the same principles,
but the driving gradient is the average
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the leaves in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be at different temperatures,
but we average those temperatures and this
[SPEAKER_00]: GS is typically for a single leaf,
but we can also calculate conductance for
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple layers of leaves too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference for a canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't change, but this one does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me say a bit about stomatal
conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets a bit more squishy and I need
some room to show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of basic principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's G sub S for stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put zero here for closed,
completely closed and if we're going off
[SPEAKER_00]: of typical numbers, this can almost get to
one and when it's one the units are moles
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared per second, moles of
water vapor per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit does not have any physical
meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a number to make the units
cancel in this whole thing, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: driving gradient does and if this is
absolute humidity here, what happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: stomates?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to go from,
as long as we're going from zero,
[SPEAKER_00]: zero would be no air at all in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to put dry, humid and dry
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good enough for the principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomatal conductance, what does this look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the driving gradient changes a lot
but do the stomates change as it gets more
[SPEAKER_00]: humid?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out they do and as air gets more
dry, stomates close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I have zero here, that probably is
about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean if it's super dry, stomates are not
constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this is so complicated because
even if we get this driving gradient
[SPEAKER_00]: right, dang the stomates keep changing
because they're responding to humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: After decades of research, and part of
it's by Keith Mott, my colleague at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University, that's his whole research is
understanding what affects these stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dry air, I'm going to erase my
numbers here, these stomates dry up and
[SPEAKER_00]: they shrink and they effectively get
farther, nope sorry, the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dry air, they protect the inside
and they start to close so that to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: this humid in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be humid so the plant can grow,
otherwise it desiccates and it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the humidity gets higher and they
open up more because there's not such a
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient, it's easier to keep this
holding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not understand exactly what these
stomates perceive in here, but humidity is
[SPEAKER_00]: a big deal and they open and close to keep
the leaf hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the classic things you see is,
this is summer, lots of people are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: zucchini and squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's common to see a squash plant around
here in the middle of the day wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see them in your garden,
if you've ever done that and you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: dang it, my squash is melted and you water
it again, it still wilts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That process is called physiological
drought and it means that the squash keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: its stomates so open, the xylem can't keep
up, can't get water to the leaves fast
[SPEAKER_00]: enough and it wilts in the middle of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it wilts, then these close and
then it gets some more water and they
[SPEAKER_00]: open, but squash overdoes it, doesn't
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stomates fast enough to stay hydrated
and most plants are very carefully
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a basic relationship between
humidity and this is really this delta,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should really say driving gradient here,
and stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomates close at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, it conserves water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get CO2 in for photosynthesis
but there's no photosynthesis at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: they close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also know if we did, let's see if I
can draw another, if we also did CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration on this same graph and
stomatal conductance and now this is CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the leaf as the CO2, this is high
CO2 and this is low CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the CO2 gets low, the stomates open to
let more in and if you give them more CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know this from when we enrich plants
with CO2, they grow faster and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomates close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would they lose water?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got plenty of CO2, they start to
close their stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CO2 affects this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mostly is determined by
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the photosynthesis gets faster because
of that CO2, then it drives it over here
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've got to have open stomates to
get fast photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like breathing to get the CO2 in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at night photosynthesis stops and they
close their stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the day, the higher the sun,
they're trying to get the stomates open to
[SPEAKER_00]: get more CO2 so they can grow faster as
long as they can keep up with the water
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a nutshell, and I'm going to close
here, this is why direct measurements of
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration are so difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we can get driving gradient,
we've always got to be estimating this
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and these estimates are,
you can make nice measurements in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you measure resistance for
stomates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, we used to take microscopes and
look at the size of the stomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're more open here, measure that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do it now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure this and then we measure this
and we calculate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the remaining thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done this thousands of times,
rearranged this equation to get resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we start to make drive principles
like this for what the stomates do and
[SPEAKER_00]: after we get those principles,
what environmental conditions affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomates, then we take them to the field
and try and predict whole canopies from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of it is driving gradients are
not difficult and we know they're related
[SPEAKER_00]: to those and those we can measure and
calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calculate based on psychometric
principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the end of the transpiration part
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could find an outline here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just blew through this whole works right
here in transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow, lecture six, we'll talk about
conduction and convection, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same fluxes driving gradient over
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes pretty fast because it's the
same equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can really nail this because guess
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The resistance here does not involve
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just involves wind blowing and cooling
things and those are physical principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can nail heat transfer by
conduction and convection because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no biology, squishy biology of the
stomates opening and closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can get this and then again by
subtraction we can get transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see you tomorrow at one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
