[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we're talking about not
radiation or wind or reflectance but a
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement of gases in the air and
particularly oxygen and this is so
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful because gases are used to measure
metabolic rates of bacteria, of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: of people and particularly of course
oxygen and CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure photosynthesis by measuring CO2
changes but oxygen also changes and oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors are far cheaper than CO2 sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have for some time sold this oxygen
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of what it looks like
buried in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the common applications
putting it in soil to measure soil gas
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously if a plant is growing and it's
healthy and it's consuming oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil the oxygen goes down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one we want to understand how
low that is but number two the rate at
[SPEAKER_00]: which it goes down helps us tell the
respiration rate of the root system of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant which tells us something about
health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's both to monitor oxygen and to do
metabolic rate studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor fundamentally it's a galvanic
cell sensor so it causes a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction with the oxygen gas which creates
a tiny voltage and it's measured by a data
[SPEAKER_00]: logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the general physics of the
signal transduction of this, the changing
[SPEAKER_00]: of the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a screen on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we have a oxygen sensor
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter do you know if we have an oxygen
sensor here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could pass one around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps keep the water away from the
sensing tip but also to measure a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a few hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I can't remember the exact price
but they're not thousands so that means
[SPEAKER_00]: they're much more accessible to many more
people to have multiple sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have a couple example pictures
of this and then I want to talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one application in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used this quite a bit in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a Petri dish sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tip drill a tiny hole put the sensor
in there and we're measuring the change in
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen in this Petri dish which is an
indication of the metabolic rate of these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one in a jar, drill a hole,
put the sensor in the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this jar there's no respiration
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's metabolically inert but if we run the
temperature up and down we would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: get zeros in that jar and all kinds of
things are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity in the jar is changing which
dilutes the oxygen but we want to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate correction factors so we can
get a clean zero in a jar where there
[SPEAKER_00]: really isn't any respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a laboratory use of this but it
also has a similar uses in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to show this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the, I tell the students,
this is the most important equation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world to a biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is respiration going this way and
photosynthesis going this way and if we
[SPEAKER_00]: can measure the rate of oxygen depletion
or the rate of CO2 buildup we know the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic rate and that's as simple as
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One mole of oxygen disappearing means one
mole of carbon has been metabolized in
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can precisely calculate metabolism
and you can do that with either oxygen or
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the background of oxygen is much
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of it with the meter and
the sensor on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now to come full circle in the very
first talk I talked about relative and
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the water vapor in air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same principle applies to all the
gases in air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have relative measurements which are
listed here and we have absolute units
[SPEAKER_00]: listed on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative, not surprisingly, it's percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same exact concept as relative
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can call that mole fraction,
the pressure of oxygen divided by total
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another measure of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, in the case of humidity,
the sensors measure relative units and we
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated absolute units.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the sensors is measuring the
absolute units and we convert to relative
[SPEAKER_00]: units.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these units are exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moles or mass of the gas per unit
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go through a couple of examples
of how this affects us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this all comes from what we all
learned in even high school chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: PV equals nRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure and volume equals the moles times
ideal gas constant times absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're making these measurements,
you get good at making those conversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can calculate metabolic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's sensors respond to absolute and we
calibrate it in relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barometric pressure affects the
concentration of gas in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to measure pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to measure it electronically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about our sensor,
but easy to measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the pressure changes and gets higher
pressure, that gas gets more dense and you
[SPEAKER_00]: conclude that there's respiration,
but there's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a change in pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a great way to show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barometric pressure is the red line as we
go up the top of Mount Everest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the unit over here is concentration of
gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another test question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtually everybody needs compressed
oxygen to climb Mount Everest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percent oxygen at sea level is 20.95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the percent oxygen on the top of
Mount Everest?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's 20.95%, why we need oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, low pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The density of oxygen molecules is way
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an example of the correction
for pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're measuring this, we often
measure pressure with it so we can correct
[SPEAKER_00]: for differences in pressure and sort out
metabolism from everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure doesn't change that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure fronts, low pressure fronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high altitude pressure,
but still pressure from highs to lows only
[SPEAKER_00]: changes the density of air about 1% and
maybe 2% on extreme events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our pressures, even though they have a
huge effect on our weather, only have a
[SPEAKER_00]: small effect on the density of gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we measure and correct for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we put this sensor in soil and we
don't want to measure the changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is very close to 100% humidity all
the time, because it's all these wet
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces all in equilibrium with the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you put a sensor in soil
like this, it's got a tiny gore-tex
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane that's gas permeable,
but it doesn't let water into the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put that in soil and you just leave
it, sooner or later it gets condensation
[SPEAKER_00]: on the membrane, because 100% humidity and
the soil temperature is cycling,
[SPEAKER_00]: well the sensor stops working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The membrane has got water on it,
gas can't come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we heat the sensor just a little bit,
just 1 degree C above the background,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that prevents condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough to change the metabolism,
but it is enough to keep the condensation
[SPEAKER_00]: off the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other factor reason water vapor is a
big deal is water vapor is maybe 3% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules in the air, but as the humidity
and temperature go up and down,
[SPEAKER_00]: the oxygen gets diluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: These water vapor molecules come in,
and again it's apparent respiration only
[SPEAKER_00]: because of dilution of the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't go through all the details of
this, but you have to correct for the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the soil to get the
absolute oxygen concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is happening in the background in
software of the sensor to sort out what
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of the change in signal is true
metabolism by plant roots, and what
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction is just apparent caused by
changes in the gas composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously if there's this thing in air,
and it gave us a 21%, and then we put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in 100% humidity, it starts to read lower
because of all the water vapor molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: diluting the oxygen molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is, same thing, and that's how we
do this test and the corrections for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally the third thing is
temperature, PVNRT, this is absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin temperature, but as the temperature
goes up and down, it also changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: density of the air and the oxygen in the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a temperature effect on
electronics of the sensor, we had to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct for, and then gas liquid
partitioning, the amount of gas in
[SPEAKER_00]: solution and the amount in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's enough, the temperature and the
apparent change in reading, this is at 19
[SPEAKER_00]: to 22 degrees, it's a big effect of
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also the, this red line is the
effect on the electronics, and fortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty flat in here from about 15 to
35 C, but at hot and cold temperatures we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to correct for temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature effects almost every single
sensor we have, there's hardly any sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't have some temperature
interaction, and we're always measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: those and correcting for them in software
or trying to build sensors that are so
[SPEAKER_00]: robust they have a minimal temperature
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a couple slides since the final
slides, I'm going to close with people
[SPEAKER_00]: have suggested sensors we might build,
and as a company we're constantly thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's our next sensor we're going to
work on, and how do we decide what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors to work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, it's not brain surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many are we going to sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people would buy a sensor like
this if we build it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's ten, we probably won't build the
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a hundred, then we decide how much
R&D will it take to make the first one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a ratio of investment costs for R
&D to the number sold, and when that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable we decide to work on the sensor,
but it's also how much R&D will it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long we've been working on that net
radiometer?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of money invested in making
the first one, and so we're just now
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hold your breath as a company and
hope people will buy the stuff that you
[SPEAKER_00]: build, otherwise you're going to be out of
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a sensor that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some preliminary testing,
and I could make a joke and say don't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: our competitors about this, but even if
you told them they'd say well that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard sensor to build, we're not going to
make it because it's too much of a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can make a sensor in soil that both
measures carbon dioxide and oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: together, we can get what's called
respiratory quotient, and that tells us
[SPEAKER_00]: what materials are being metabolized by
the bacteria in the soils, and I'll give
[SPEAKER_00]: you some examples of respiratory quotient,
but here's an example of a bucket and some
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen sensors and a CO2 sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that equation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this goes that way, this is one,
that's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the respiratory quotient is
one, but what if the bacteria were
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizing lignin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lignin is CH2 with hardly any oxygen,
or fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fats hardly have any oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Substrates change in the ratio of CH2O,
and that changes the ratio of CO2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, and with such a sensor we can tell
what's being metabolized in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the advantage of measuring CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so little in the background it's
easy to measure a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean this is just 0.04% CO2 in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can easily measure change.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge background, so it's hard to
measure tiny changes in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to measure tiny changes in CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time we do these metabolic
measurements we have bicarbonate effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's a whole other lecture which I'm
not going to talk about, but CO2 goes in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out of solution, and it's not
metabolism, and we've got to correct for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then oxygen is also the sensors,
much lower cost, although we're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with some CO2 sensors now that are we
think they're going to be down around $300
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this, so the cost of CO2 sensors is
coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would normally be one-to-one,
but look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this respiratory quotient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbohydrates, one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteins, 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fats, 0.6, and lignin, 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could begin to start to see what's
being degraded, what type of material is
[SPEAKER_00]: being degraded, if we can develop this
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think this would sell a lot,
and it's one we're slowly working toward
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that, is it Wendy Silver?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that sensor coming along?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's really anxious to buy them as soon
as you announce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another huge deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that we put ammonium on,
even in an ecosystem the degradation makes
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium, and the bacteria gradually
oxidize this to nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This respiratory quotient uses two oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can begin to tell what forms of
nitrogen the bacteria are utilizing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we don't like to say what
we're working on because people get so
[SPEAKER_00]: excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it to happen next year,
and it's way down the road, and we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: big problem as our company and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you say when a sensor is going to
be ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people get anxious to buy it,
and sometimes you think it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: ready next month, and it still takes six
more months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep working on refining the
technologies, but this is one that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early idea stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of my favorite slides,
but I'm going to conclude with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this gets you excited about making
more measurements with more kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a joy to collect data, and you know
how the world is supposed to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you try and measure it and see if
it really works like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And linking back to those very first
quotes I showed, if theory and measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: don't agree, you got a red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amazing thing is the theory is
wrong sometimes, and your measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: rock solid, and you can get a Nobel Prize
for overturning some things we thought we
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that we really don't know so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after all, that's what re-search is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take stuff we thought we knew and see if
we really know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think we know something and we're
pretty sure we know it and we're wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the worst problems of all of
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with measurements getting better and
better and better, we can revisit some
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we thought we knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you get an opportunity to use
these instruments in your research and all
[SPEAKER_00]: your endeavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look forward to the potential of
working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Thank you.
