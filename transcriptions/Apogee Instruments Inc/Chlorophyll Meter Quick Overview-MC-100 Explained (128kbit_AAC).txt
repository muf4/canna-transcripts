[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments, and today I'd like to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about chlorophyll meters, especially the
non-destructive chlorophyll meters that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very widely used by a number of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through a little bit of the
history of it, how they work, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: advances that have been made over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the 1980s, Minolta came out with
this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was made by the Scientific Products
Analysis Division at Minolta, and they use
[SPEAKER_00]: their acronym, call it a SPAD meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people have begun to think SPAD
is synonymous with chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an acronym for a company,
but that was the first meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some years later, OptiSciences came
out with this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some advantages over the Minolta
meter, a little bigger area to average
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, and then recently Apogee
Instruments came out with this meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has some fundamental advances over
the other types of research-grade meters
[SPEAKER_00]: for chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at what those
differences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is, if we draw a leaf,
it's full of cells, and these cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: full of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we shine a light on this leaf,
and we put a detector down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get the transmitted light through
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty easy to do, and it gets us
the amount of cellulose in the leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of chlorophyll in the leaf,
both together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll is in here in little
packets inside these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to really be able to measure this,
we take another wavelength of light and
[SPEAKER_00]: another detector down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is red light, and this is
near-infrared light, NIR.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all on the Apogee website,
the details of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, by subtraction, we can get at the
amount of chlorophyll in this leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the electrical output of these two
detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make a graph of this difference,
and we put transmission down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratio of these wavelengths,
and we put chlorophyll up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to abbreviate that just CHL
for chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be lovely if we got a nice
straight line, and the transmission was
[SPEAKER_00]: directly related to chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have a meter that told us
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the distribution of
chlorophyll in a leaf is so clumped up
[SPEAKER_00]: that the light goes in many directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't come straight through the leaf,
and when we make this graph, it's highly
[SPEAKER_00]: nonlinear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fundamental characteristic of all
of these optical meters to get this
[SPEAKER_00]: nonlinear relationship between
transmission and chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you what happens with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put tick marks in this graph now,
and we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we make a
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement here, and we have that much
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call that amount 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we make another measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out here at 5, and you would think the
chlorophyll went up by a factor of 2.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in fact, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: This only doubles, so the transmission is
not a direct indicator of the chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has led to lots of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: People write papers, and they say the SPAD
number went from 2 to 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, my chlorophyll doubled,
and that is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll did not double.
[SPEAKER_00]: This index doubled, so the SPAD Minolta
meter that reads in SPAD units only gives
[SPEAKER_00]: an index that's nonlinearly related to
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OptiSciences meter also gives an index
that's nonlinearly related to chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of these problems, and because of
the need to really measure chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee instruments built on the research
that developed characteristic lines like
[SPEAKER_00]: this for each species of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one line for wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another line for corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a line for rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all take the same basic shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have slightly different
curvatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this equation, you can convert
transmission into actual chlorophyll in
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is a graph where we have
chlorophyll here, actual chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: measured by extracting the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit down here is now optical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship is a straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can very accurately measure chlorophyll
in the leaf with the appropriate software
[SPEAKER_00]: in the meter to convert this family of
curved lines into straight lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of the Apogee meter in
terms of what it does to get chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: This took a lot of work, a lot of
measurements of chlorophyll and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-destructive chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a video that shows the techniques
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a family of curves in there for 22
species and it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting a curve in there for
potatoes and other species now so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: establish this linear relationship between
what the optical meter measures and the
[SPEAKER_00]: true chlorophyll in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nutshell, that's the advance in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sufficiently big advance that
Apogee patented this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a patent pending on this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It now allows researchers to get
measurements of chlorophyll without having
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill the leaf, without having to
extract the leaf and measure it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrophotometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nutshell of the advances in these
measurements over the last 30 years.
Thank you.
you
