[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith and I do
technical sales and support here at Apigee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments and today we're going to talk
about choosing the right infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer for you, going through all the
options of infrared radiometers that
[SPEAKER_00]: Apigee Instruments has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're going to cover all the field of
view options, we're going to cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the SI100, SI400,
and SIF series, and then we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through a demonstration of using our field
of view calculators that we have available
[SPEAKER_00]: as an app and on the spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first thing, the SI100 and SIF100
series are both analog, so that means that
[SPEAKER_00]: they both require two channels in order to
read them, a differential channel to read
[SPEAKER_00]: the millivolt output from the thermopile,
and then a single-ended channel in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to read the sensor body temperature,
which is the thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those thermistors are usually
measured with half-bridge measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the difference between the SI100
and SIF 100 is that the SIF100 is a fast
[SPEAKER_00]: response, has a 0.2 second response time,
whereas the SIF100 has a 0.6 second
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see how that affects the
signal size, it being a much smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: signal between 5 and 15 microvolts per
degree C on the SIF series, whereas the
[SPEAKER_00]: SIF100 is between 20 and 60 microvolts per
degree C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the SIF100 is ideal for static
stations on traditional data loggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your SIF100 series is ideal if you're on a
moving platform of some sort doing
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements connected to data loggers
that have that high resolution that can
[SPEAKER_00]: read that small signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SIF400 series is all completely
digital using the SDI12 protocol,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's ideal for your static stations
that require multiple sensors with a
[SPEAKER_00]: logger that can read that digital SDI12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, in each one of those, we have the
different field of view options.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the SIF100 and SIF400 series,
we have four field of view options from
[SPEAKER_00]: our narrowest 14-degree half-angle field
of view up to our horizontal field of
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we report that in half-angles,
and if you want more information,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can click there on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, due to the small signal
size, we only have three of those field of
[SPEAKER_00]: view options available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've put together this table to kind
of explain a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the largest field of view,
the 22-degree field of view, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: SIF111, SIF411, SIF111, and MI210,
the MI referring to the infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer connected to the handheld meter
that gives you that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can look there to find your
corresponding field of view for which
[SPEAKER_00]: model it corresponds with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great illustration showing
that same concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the SIF111 is equal to the 22-degree
field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in this particular
application where you're doing crop
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, the SIF111 may not be ideal
because it's seeing much more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seeing the trees and the mountains
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the horizontal is seeing the most
amount of the crop and just the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: without anything behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go through this next on the
field of view calculator demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the field of view calculator is
available as an app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for Apogee Instruments in your
app store and you'll be able to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few other things we have to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's also available on our
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is the link right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that and we'll just go to
the website right now and go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just come here to apogeeinstruments
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here we are on the web page,
on the home page.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come over here to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will click there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the far side over here is
infrared radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll click here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is a lot of information on this
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the frequently asked questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you have questions yourself,
if this is going to fit for your
[SPEAKER_00]: application, I would come look through
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of helpful articles and
links on trying to get that to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one there being field of view
explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that on an earlier slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the link that you want to look
through if you want to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: information on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to click on the second one
here, field of view and canopy fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: calculators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just open this up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to say viewing angle and
viewing height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's just take for an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we wanted to do a 10 meter by 10
meter plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to measure the crop canopy
inside this 10 meter by 10 meter plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we want to maximize our field of view
to get as much of that in there as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's start with the SI111,
which is equivalent to that 22 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just say that our viewing angle
is 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our viewing height is 1.5 meters above
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we calculate, it gives over here
and says our field of view is seeing 122.8
[SPEAKER_00]: meters squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, which is good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells us the total surface area it's
seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't really know how that's
allocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, to get those details, we need to
look at the Excel sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, that's right here, this link here,
Excel sheet program to calculate target
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, download that and then open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've done that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's that Excel sheet, what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've pre-entered in these values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've chosen the SI111, which is
equivalent to the 22 degree field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 degrees is our angle from the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 1.5 meters above the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives us that same 122.82.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we scroll down, then we'll see those
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, again, we're trying to look
at a 10 meter by 10 meter plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: is our example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we want to know what our length is
from A to D, what our field of view is
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we come down here, we see right
here it says 27.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to cut that down to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's come back up and let's adjust
the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's adjust this to 63 and be 1 meter
above the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've significantly lowered this from
122 to 24.2, but let's see how that
[SPEAKER_00]: allocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our A to D is right here, 10.56.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's pretty close to our 10 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our C to F or B would be our
widest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we come down here and it's 1.46.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we need to double that so we have the
full width, and that would be 3 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, essentially, we're at 3 meters wide
and just over 10 meters long, if we were
[SPEAKER_00]: to use the SI111 in that application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look at what it would look like
with the horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we come over here and do the SI1H1,
and let's go back to our original numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing 65 and 1.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 65 degrees, with our height being
1.5 meters above the crop canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we come down here,
we can get our details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we want to know first what is our
length that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we need to know G2 to G1,
and that's equal to V right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says it's 5.14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's less than our 10 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could possibly maximize that some more,
but that's less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's figure out our widest part,
our G2 to F times 2 is equivalent right
[SPEAKER_00]: here to 8.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's not maximized either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's less than our 10 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can come back up here and adjust
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's actually just adjust it to 2
meters above the crop, leaving the angle
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've almost doubled our surface area
from 27 to 48 meters squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll come down here and look at
V.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now 6.85 meters long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still within that 10 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then our width which is G2 to F is
here, 10.73.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're just over that 10 meters,
but we're pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could obviously dial that in to
maximize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see in this example of our 10
meter by 10 meter square plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the horizontal does a lot better covering
more surface area and maximizing that
[SPEAKER_00]: field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you can see in these examples,
we were doing pretty specific angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in order to get those angles,
I highly recommend using some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: angle locator, angle finder, so you can
get that right on 62 degrees or 65
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We resell these, but you can of course buy
your own or find your own anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so you can get those angles exactly
where you want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that concludes our video today on the
infrared radiometer, choosing the right
[SPEAKER_00]: one for you.

comment below and we'll get right back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you on those.
