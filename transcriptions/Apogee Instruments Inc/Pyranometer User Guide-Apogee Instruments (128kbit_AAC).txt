[SPEAKER_00]: Today we'll be talking about the proper
installation and maintenance of your
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee pyranometer to ensure its
performance for as many years as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee's pyranometers are built tough but
they are precision instruments so
[SPEAKER_00]: following these tips will ensure the best
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: First when choosing a location to mount
your pyranometer make sure it's in a spot
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a full unobstructed view of the
Sun throughout the entire day and even
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire year for long-term
deployment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Periodic shading of the sensor from nearby
objects will affect the accuracy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are mounting the sensor on a
weather station it's best to mount it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest point on the tower or at least
on the south side of the tower in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern hemisphere or on the north side
of the tower if you are in the southern
[SPEAKER_00]: hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: For global horizontal irradiance
measurements be sure to mount the sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly level.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make mounting easier Apogee carries a
line of mounting hardware that is designed
[SPEAKER_00]: to fit perfectly with our sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee AL100 leveling plate is a
stable platform for the sensor and has
[SPEAKER_00]: three adjustment screws and an integrated
bubble level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensor is mounted directly to the
plate by threading the included nylon
[SPEAKER_00]: mounting screw through the center hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: To mount the leveling plate to a cross arm
we recommend the Apogee AM110 sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: mounting bracket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pre-drilled to mate with the
leveling plate and comes with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardware needed to mount it firmly to mass
or pipes up to two inches in diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When using our pyranometers to monitor
solar panel performance you may opt for a
[SPEAKER_00]: plane of array mounting configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the sensor is on the same plane as
the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the AL100 leveling plate and AM110
mounting bracket can be used to mount the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor securely.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you can use your own hardware as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you mount your sensor you'll need to
wire it to the data logger or controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this demonstration we'll be using a
CR1000 data logger from Campbell
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wiring should be similar for most data
loggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few different configurations
that you will need to use depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which model of pyranometer you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The output of the SP110 and SP230 are
considered self-powered and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: monitored using a differential or
single-ended channel measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: When wiring to a differential channel
simply wire the sensors red wire to the
[SPEAKER_00]: high and the black wire to the low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensors clear shield wire should be
wired to the data loggers analog ground
[SPEAKER_00]: for cable screening of electromagnetic
interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: For single-ended measurements wire the
sensors red wire to the single-ended
[SPEAKER_00]: channel and then the black and clear wire
should be wired to the analog ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wiring the heater circuit of the SP230
will require a 12 volt DC power supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect the white wire of the plus 12 volt
DC signal and the green wire to the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative or ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP212 and SP215 provide an amplified
voltage output and therefore require an
[SPEAKER_00]: input voltage in order to operate
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to check the sensor manual for
the proper input voltage range for each
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect the sensors white wire to the
positive voltage signal and the clear wire
[SPEAKER_00]: to the negative or ground of the power
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensors green wire is the output and
should be wired to the single-ended
[SPEAKER_00]: channel or the voltage input to a
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP214 provides a 4 to 20 milliamp
output and requires an input voltage range
[SPEAKER_00]: of 5 to 36 volts DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: To power the sensor connect the red wire
to the positive voltage signal and the
[SPEAKER_00]: black wire to the negative or ground of
the power source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clear shield wire should be connected
to an analog ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next wire the white wire to the
controller's 4 to 20 milliamp input and
[SPEAKER_00]: the green wire to the input ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining your Apogee pyranometer is a
two-part process of making sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: optical path remains clean and
occasionally checking that your
[SPEAKER_00]: pyranometer's calibration is still
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the dome shape of our
pyranometers keeping the sensor head clean
[SPEAKER_00]: is a relatively easy job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sensor does become dirty the next
range should automatically clean the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor or you can simply rinse the sensor
with water or even a little window
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sensor becomes encrusted with
mineral deposits we recommend that you
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it with vinegar and a soft cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lens is made from acrylic so avoid
using cleaners or tools that are abrasive
[SPEAKER_00]: and can scratch the lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step in your maintenance routine
is occasionally checking that your sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: is calibrated properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee pyranometers have a long-term drift
rate of less than 3% per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many applications this slight yearly
drift is insignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However accuracy is important so in
general we recommend that you send your
[SPEAKER_00]: pyranometer to us for recalibration every
two to three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However most pyranometers will drift much
less than the 3% a year so you may be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to forego calibration for a longer period
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are curious and don't have access
to a reference pyranometer Apogee has
[SPEAKER_00]: developed a website called the clear sky
calculator that can provide you with an
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated amount of solar radiation
falling on a horizontal surface at any
[SPEAKER_00]: time of day in any location of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to clearskycalculator.com and
enter your exact coordinates and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other parameters to get an accurate
reference measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pyranometer reads too far off it
may be time to send in the sensor for
[SPEAKER_00]: recalibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all there is to mounting and
maintaining your pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However here are a few more little tips
and troubleshooting issues you might find
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the simplest problems we see is
people failing to remove the green
[SPEAKER_00]: protective cap from the pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green cap is designed for protection
of the lens when you are transporting or
[SPEAKER_00]: storing your pyranometer but needs to be
removed when you are taking reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick and easy check of sensor
functionality can be determined using a
[SPEAKER_00]: voltmeter with millivolt resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect the positive lead of the voltmeter
to the red wire from the sensor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative lead or common to the black wire
from the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct the sensor's diffuser toward a
light source and verify the sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: provides a signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blocking all radiation from the sensor
should force the sensor signal to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally if you have any questions about
your Apogee pyranometer you can find a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of information on our website or feel free
to contact our tech support department.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the techs are highly trained and
willing to help answer any questions.
