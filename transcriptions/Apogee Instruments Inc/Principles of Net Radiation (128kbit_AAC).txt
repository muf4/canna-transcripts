[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments and in today's video we'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about net radiation and I want to
talk about the evolution of measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: and models to get to this key parameter
and particularly the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments and I'm going to show you in a
few minutes some of the instruments that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've used to measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's why it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about it all the time but not
everybody has a good understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really want to know is how much to
irrigate crops and there's no sensor to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the flux of water vapor coming out
of a crop directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always use indirect measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most time-honored and classic
measurements is to measure all the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the energy balance model and
measure all the parameters around it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then by subtraction get at transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what the model looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Rn which is the thing we're
talking about equals lambda Et
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration plus h is sensible heat
flux plus g is soil heat flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are classic symbols.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to know them to understand
net radiation except we can do a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable job of measuring this and this
and if we can measure net radiation by
[SPEAKER_00]: subtraction we can calculate the
irrigation needs of a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this exact same simple model is used
to determine global warming as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So net radiation is the key driver so we
really need accurate measurements of that
[SPEAKER_00]: both for global warming issues and for
crop irrigation needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at the
state-of-the-art of this about 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2005 the American Society for Civil
Engineers came out with this book,
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop Evapotranspiration and this whole
book is about the details of calculating
[SPEAKER_00]: that equation I just drew up there and in
the beginning of the book it makes this
[SPEAKER_00]: statement, net radiation is difficult to
measure so we recommend, this is a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: society, we recommend modeling net
radiation from shortwave radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure, and air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This prediction is highly accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measure, we model a lot of things in
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We model the things we have trouble
measuring but we co-evolve measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: and models to get the most accurate
analysis of everything we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look in a minute at where we've
come since this statement was written in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of instruments to measure net
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's worth talking about the person
that was the editor of this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my friend and colleague Rick Allen
who was at Utah State University when he
[SPEAKER_00]: did all this work and he felt strongly
about this because he saw a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: making bad measurements and he said you
should model it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model for this is not all that
trivial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is, four components, some
assumptions for these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into this model but
you can easily look at it in the book or
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pause on this slide and see all
the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model's got plenty of challenges as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's switch to measurements from the
model and for this we fast forward four
[SPEAKER_00]: years to 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a massive field study of all the
state-of-the-art net radiometers at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and ran them for all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully cleaned the domes on a daily
basis, leveled them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's all the instruments on our rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five different
types of instruments, three replicates of
[SPEAKER_00]: each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the models and the number of
outputs of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before we get into the number of
outputs, let's take a look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before I even show you these,
we were studying radiation well before
[SPEAKER_00]: this with state-of-the-art instruments at
the time and let me show you a very
[SPEAKER_00]: classic instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is in our museum now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't use it in the study but
instruments, precision instruments,
[SPEAKER_00]: used to come in wood boxes and this is a
Swiss Teco net radiometer made by a Swiss
[SPEAKER_00]: company that was state-of-the-art for many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to have a pump and inflate the domes
but it attempted to do short wave and long
[SPEAKER_00]: wave measurements and it's a gorgeous
instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's since been replaced by several other
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start at the low end.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our instruments was this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a radiation and energy balance
systems model Q7.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attempts to get at radiation by,
and all of these are nets so they have an
[SPEAKER_00]: incoming and an outgoing, just by one
simple black body that attempts to balance
[SPEAKER_00]: short and long wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the lowest cost of these
instruments in the study and we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at how this did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one up is a Kippensohn and NR
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these fine plates on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This again is similar, doing net and long
wave radiation with one single output from
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sensitive to wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind cools it so there's a wind correction
for this which we used in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we keep going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Huxaflux that you can see the
on the screen but now look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four separate sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short wave in, short wave out,
long wave in, long wave out, four outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a considerable step up from these
other instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally the most expensive
instrument of all is this Kippensohn CNR-1
[SPEAKER_00]: which is shown in our pictures Oh,
we've got the CNR-1 in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CNR-1 is the predecessor to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big and heavy instrument right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came out after this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a similar instrument, same company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slight upgrade from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it has four outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two on the bottom, two on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how'd this come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are ranked from the bottom to
the top in increasing order of price and
[SPEAKER_00]: not terribly surprisingly the accuracy
went up with the increasing price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of like you get what you pay
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the absolutely clear things we
found out about this was these instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: that had four outputs were fundamentally
more accurate than the ones that only had
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember these instruments that just have
two sides I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just give you one number and they
attempt to separate short wave fluxes and
[SPEAKER_00]: long wave fluxes and that's very
challenging to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to measure them separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put on this a green box
around this because the two most expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: ones with four outputs were also the most
accurate in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a lot of data very carefully
analyzed with multiple outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mark Blondquist who was the Apogee
chief scientist that I've worked with for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time on this out here polishing and
leveling these instruments in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the summer we published
this in Agriculture and Forest
[SPEAKER_00]: Meteorology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to this paper and see all
the details of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the separate pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a nutshell the thing we came away
with from this was four-way instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: are better than the lesser instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said models might be better than
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at what we found from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the instruments in this study were
more accurate than the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fundamentally disprove that
statement that if the instruments are
[SPEAKER_00]: level and clean they're more accurate than
the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ought to be measuring net radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more expensive instruments were a lot
more accurate and how far off were they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a simple graph out of many that we
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model was 10% high compared to
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the measurements so 10% high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that's not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to overwater 10%,
waste 10% to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is a really precious resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider a 10% error in this model to be
pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since this paper came out we have seen
an enormous number of people switch to
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring this from modeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also published in another paper
in agricultural water management that
[SPEAKER_00]: really made the point that the
measurements are better than the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our colleague Rick Allen was on record
saying the model is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Allen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became a co-author with us in this
paper to make a very clear statement that
[SPEAKER_00]: the instruments are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that led to using instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we fast forward a few more years and
because Apogee instruments has a long
[SPEAKER_00]: history of measuring these parameters,
Apogee started working on a new design for
[SPEAKER_00]: a net radiometer that incorporated four
components into a single instrument and
[SPEAKER_00]: has an intermediate price.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the design that Apogee has just
recently released after four years of
[SPEAKER_00]: refinement and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a four component radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short wave in, short wave out,
long wave in, long wave out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would take up, all of these
instruments take up a lot of channels on a
[SPEAKER_00]: data acquisition system and which are
precious channels that can be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this we made the output SDI-12 and
it only takes up an SDI-12 channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have multiple sensors in the same
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we consider this a pretty fundamental
breakthrough in the world of measuring net
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small, easy to level and has,
I'm going to show you a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: has very comparable accuracy to the
highest end instruments that cost
[SPEAKER_00]: considerably more.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges of measuring
radiation is condensation on sensors and
[SPEAKER_00]: snow on sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that reason, the Huxaflux has a heater
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one and a half watt heater so it's
very significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a big solar panel to run
this heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kippenzonen also, for extra money,
has this shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both of these high-end instruments
have heaters to try and keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument cleaned so you make accurate
measurements in all weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Apogee, because it's smaller,
has tiny heaters in each of these four
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors to keep the domes clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at what that looks like when we
put these heaters in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a winter day a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frost in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't even snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just frost covering everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heaters are clean and this is just a
fraction of the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can easily be run from solar-powered
weather stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of pictures of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the same sensor, different angle
showing the frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part doesn't need to be heated here
but these are nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was another advance of being able
to heat this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How accurate is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have deployed this in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell this is Utah because we have
mountains in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a big alfalfa field, over 15 months,
over a year, we compared them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: high-end Kippenzonen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most expensive of all the
instruments and we had three triplicate
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee net radiometers on this tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the winter, through the summer,
comparing the accuracy, here's the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Kippenzonen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 months in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them track the Kippenzonen very
accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few scattered points in here and
this is because something got on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it got on the reference sensor
and caused problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This didn't have the heated shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are times when this had an error
but the point of this is we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: pleased with this accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been over a year since we've done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the take-home messages from all of this
now are it's cost-effective to measure net
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation and as opposed to modeling it on
all stations and in the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effectiveness, we feel that this
Apogee net radiometer really fits a niche
[SPEAKER_00]: for very high accuracy and yet moderate
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you again in another
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
