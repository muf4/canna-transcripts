[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're excited to bring you the
results of some new research we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the Crop Physiology Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about light
pollution and how sensitive is cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: very low levels of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, right out of the gate, I can tell you
that our research shows that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely sensitive, but it is not as
sensitive as most people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show you how to measure the
light and interpret the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the terms that we have used is
reagent grade darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our laboratories are full of reagent grade
chemicals, which means they're very pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the contaminants aren't really zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just extremely low contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what reagent grade means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of darkness, how dark is
dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we really get to zero?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we really count photons, we're going to
talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the tolerance limits for
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the people that are doing the work on
this are Paul Kusuma, who has been in this
[SPEAKER_00]: lab for five years doing a PhD,
and we're very proud to announce just last
[SPEAKER_00]: week he finished, and now he's a
postdoctoral fellow at Wageningen
[SPEAKER_00]: University in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a lot of this work, and also
Mitchell Westmoreland, who you know
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's given you lots of lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two guys have been taking careful
measurements of multiple species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just testing cannabis,
but some other crop plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we take a look at this,
look at this title.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem seeing this title against a
black background, but now if the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to come up, this is early dawn,
how many nanomoles of light is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun's getting brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point do plants detect it's
bright?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is still night, but this is light
pollution, and now you can't even read the
[SPEAKER_00]: title because of the light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neighbors worldwide complain about our
greenhouses polluting their neighborhoods
[SPEAKER_00]: with light, but this is a two-edged sword
because their yard lights and their
[SPEAKER_00]: security lights pollute our greenhouses
with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to understand and be able to
measure these low light levels so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see when we're getting into trouble with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a dark sky organization,
darksky.org, that studies the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: very low levels of light on a wide range
of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of stories of turtles getting
confused by light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out there's good evidence that
many of the wildlife in our national parks
[SPEAKER_00]: are more sensitive to light than our
plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can sleep with lights on,
some people have to have it completely
[SPEAKER_00]: dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of interactions with
reagent-grade darkness and biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our license plate, Delicate Arch at
Arches National Park, a source of great
[SPEAKER_00]: national pride here in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is artificially lit up to get
this photograph, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: See this aurora back here?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the city of Moab in the background
with light pollution to the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are common kinds of slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would have been taken with a very
long shutter speed so we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: starlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our instruments now have to have the
equivalent of a very long shutter speed to
[SPEAKER_00]: rigorously quantify these very trace
levels of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work, you can go back in the
literature to see what the other studies
[SPEAKER_00]: have been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things that we try
to do, good scholarship.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you study, look for cannabis,
you get to a book by Daphne Vince Proulx,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1975, and it's the sensitivity of seven
species to light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now threshold value for an inhibition of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the seven species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even back then, they were studying
cannabis, not because of anything
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an interesting botanical species
that was sensitive to low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers are in lux, but they range
from 0.1 to 21.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all species that are all
sensitive to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the original references they came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book is a great piece of research on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank Royal Hines for doing
some of the early scholarship on this to
[SPEAKER_00]: find this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's convert from lux to micromoles
per meter squared per second of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not lux that triggers this,
it's numbers of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And assuming this is reflected sunlight
off the moon, we can make a conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: To units that we're more familiar with
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it is, same species, but now
micromoles per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you see is all these
numbers are below one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember full sun is like 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is low, low levels of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most normal meters have trouble even
measuring this low level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden mums are real common commercial
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pull black cloth on garden mums to get
them dark enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Kalanchoe and other floriculture
species look at poinsettia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have long considered poinsettia to be
our most sensitive commercial species to
[SPEAKER_00]: light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, based on this data,
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four times more sensitive than mums
and Kalanchoe per 0.1 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning glory, not a commercial species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on this data, 1975, that's far more
sensitive than even poinsettias to light
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybeans are also really sensitive,
but this gives me the chance to point out
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've studied soybeans a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the decades of repeated breeding
of soybeans, the sensitivity of soybeans
[SPEAKER_00]: to low light has been bred out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our modern cultivators of soybeans can
tolerate now a lot more light pollution
[SPEAKER_00]: than their early predecessors of 50 years
ago or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows you that you can use breeding
to shift the sensitivity to light
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution, but that's a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do these levels compare to what we
get from a full moon?
[SPEAKER_00]: A full moon's very bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk outside and a full moon on a
clear night and wow, it seems really
[SPEAKER_00]: bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at what full moon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study we did in 2018 with some
precision sensors on the roof of Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments, clear sky, moonrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to a peak, moon set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peak was 1.6 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's 0.16 nanomoles over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the pin on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark blue, 0.16.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be 0.0016 micromoles per meter
squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get into this business, we have to
shift our thinking from micromoles to
[SPEAKER_00]: nanomoles because the light pollution
levels get so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that graph just against a dark
sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a picture of the Apogee light
pollution detector that people are using
[SPEAKER_00]: now to detect these nanomoles of light
pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back with that 1.6 to our
original graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can put that on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we round that up to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a harvest moon, if some things can
make the moon extra bright, so instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.0016, round it to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look, these levels are almost as high
as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.06 is three times as high as full moon,
but it's close to full moon causing a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This data is from these references
reported in 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means all these studies were in the
50s and 60s on these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: How good is this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, Jim Faust at Clemson
University has recently done some very
[SPEAKER_00]: rigorous studies on the effect of light
pollution in poinsettia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we look at cannabis, let's see how
good his data is for poinsettia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's his studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Professor Faust looking at his
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a light gradient study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down here it was very dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poinsettia bracts turned red like they
should, but as he got to more light over
[SPEAKER_00]: here, there's light pollution and these
are intermediate levels of light in his
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we repeated this several times on
several cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's his data.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, micromoles, and this is days
to anthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this line right here means they turned
red quickly up to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the light pollution got worse,
it took longer and longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up at this point over here, it took over a
hundred days to turn red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a serious problem with the light
pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put some data on here, 0.04.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, let's put it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 40 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 nanomoles that the poinsettia started
to detect this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dots are two different poinsettia
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: In his work, he didn't see species
variability in poinsettia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything below that is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything below 40 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember full moon was two nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So full moon is way down here on this
graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here, 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is 400 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that completely inhibited the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep track of this number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the line starts to change
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to our screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number is 100 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it up here.
Nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Faust found they started to detect
light pollution at 40 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he found was that they were even
more sensitive than those early studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 is a lower number than 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming in close to full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could cannabis detect the full moon?
[SPEAKER_00]: We set out to study that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done replicate studies now with
cannabis, with precision levels of light
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do these studies, we turn the
light pollution on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tiny LEDs and run it continuously
through the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the level that would start to
affect poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that took more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is flower diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100 means they got big flowers quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we increased the light pollution up to
10, no effect in either Trump or Cherry,
[SPEAKER_00]: two cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry was more sensitive than Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we went to 20, we saw the flowers were
just smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plants were fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers just developed more slowly and
quite a bit more slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's half of what this, and it only took
20 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump's a little more tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took a little bit longer to fill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But based on this data, we now conclude
that 10 nanomoles or lower is dark enough
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we don't get an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: On flowering and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our reference full moon as two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our full moon reference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even full moon is not even close to bright
enough to trigger an issue in flowering in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a key thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to help you get a sense of light
levels and what full moonlight really is,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna do a little experiment here in
the lab to show you light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's start with, this is a standard
light meter that we would use to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: light for crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sunlight goes to 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably can't read this here,
but can we read that if I put it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a well lit office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got lights in here so everything's well
lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if we turn this to the floor like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already getting zero turning it down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we're talking nanomoles below
detectable limits on this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're gonna do now is turn the
lights out and show you what nanomoles
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an important rule of thumb,
and I hope you remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a book, even with large print
out on a night with full moon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the brightest full moon and the pie in the
sky, very clear skies, take it out and try
[SPEAKER_00]: and read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought Charlotte's Web,
a children's book because it's got big
[SPEAKER_00]: print, easy to read here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a night with full moon, even with a
dark adapted office, the pie, you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: read the print in a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your greenhouse is so dark you can't
read a book with big print, you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna trigger the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one LED in the corner,
that's not enough to read a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna trigger the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice rule of thumb for how dark
you are in a greenhouse or dark room
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's try some experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn out these lights and measure
nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are with all of our studio
lights turned off, but with a dimmable LED
[SPEAKER_00]: in the back of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we took our standard light meter to
do this, there's a light enough to shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: this video, it's zeros.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some number less than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clearly not really zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too low to detect one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go to our light pollution detector,
which is a thousand times more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this reads out in nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has Bluetooth, so it's reading on my
phone right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I hold this here, I'm getting 70
nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is plenty of light pollution to
cause problems, at least with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I take my Charlotte's Web book,
I have no problem reading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading it all with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now what if we go darker?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna try to get this even less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've reduced this to 37 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is still enough light pollution
to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can still read my book without a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to wait now to let my eyes adapt,
but I can still read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can get it even darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're down 17, 13, nine, seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we're down at a light level
that cannabis wouldn't detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm gonna even turn this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at four nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis wouldn't detect this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the book, and if I let my eyes
adapt, I can just barely read this book in
[SPEAKER_00]: this light at four nanomoles of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I wouldn't wanna read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even, yeah, I have to have dark
adapted eyes to see the print.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is four nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is measured with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is pointed right at the light
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a sense of how dark is
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're bringing the light up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this, 40 nanomoles, 70 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are light levels that would trigger
problems, but this is a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can read this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read this thing from your computer
screen where you're sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we're giving this, now we're going
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hold this up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 60 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going down 40 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 20 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 nanomoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of light pollution we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that little red LED there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way that's enough to cause a
problem with cannabis flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be brighter than it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line is our eyes are
exquisitely sensitive to low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our irises open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can detect light pollution extremely
well, but you have to measure it to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a problem with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go back to full light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're back to full light in the studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these tests, we were able to run
the light all the way up to 50 and above
[SPEAKER_00]: and back down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see once again, this zone
right here below 10 is what we consider
[SPEAKER_00]: safe for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, our eyes are so sensitive,
we can detect one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, down here, but you got to measure
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have light pollution in one spot
and 10 feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one crack of light could affect one
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see strange things happening with a
plant in a corner, it doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it was light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, you've got to measure the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to this full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our data here suggest this would be six
nanomoles from 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our data indicate that this number is
closer to 10 for the most sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: species detecting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one other thing we have done is
interactions with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have found, I'm not going to go
into this in detail, but this is nanomoles
[SPEAKER_00]: of light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slope of the line is steeper for cool
night temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there's an interaction with
night temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants appear to be more sensitive to
light pollution when the nights are cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: than when they're warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an area of active study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this is going to shift the
wildly shift the data, but it might shift
[SPEAKER_00]: it from 10 down to seven for detection
limits if the nights are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the average cannabis is somewhere
right in the middle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's neither a warm night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The warm nights in this, I think,
were 28 degrees and the cool nights were
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere in the 80s and in the 60s at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a big range, but it might
interact with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, how does it interact with
color?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our studies were done with pure red
light, which is the most potent source of
[SPEAKER_00]: light for phytochrome and for triggering
light responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're comfortable saying 10 is
a safe limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study of the growth of the
flowers with time after the start of short
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a micrometer and measured the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first thing you want to look at
is the control, completely dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flowers got big at this rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue light at the same intensity as all
the others had no effect on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that red has an effect,
but in this study, look at green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light was just as potent as red
light for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say green lights are safe lights for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study, the green light was just as
potent as red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of a cross section of a
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bottom of that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red very
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those colors don't penetrate,
but chlorophyll reflects green and the
[SPEAKER_00]: green hits and penetrates deep into the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is part of the reason that green
light is not as safe as we might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't go out here running around
saying, Dr. Budby says that green light's
[SPEAKER_00]: not safe at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our eyes are so sensitive to green,
we can see plants with one one hundredth
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of green light as we can with
blue or red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still, if you've got to have a light,
it's still the best color of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is not completely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some outfits have green lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, that's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't have any lights on at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it interacts with color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at what we call reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we give the plants a bright flash
versus a low steady level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're studying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some other crops, there is reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is related to the cumulative dose of
light at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should now be talking about night light
integral for light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our studies were done with steady
state light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're studying, starting to study
what happens if we give them bright light
[SPEAKER_00]: for a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new frontier and cannabis is a
wonderful botanical species for this
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is so sensitive to low levels
of light at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff, this work led to this paper by
Paul Kusuma published in Frontiers and
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Science, Improving the Predictive
Value of Phytochrome Photoequilibria
[SPEAKER_00]: Consideration of Spectral Distortion in a
Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have found is our prediction of
phytochrome needs to change too because
[SPEAKER_00]: again, because of green light penetrating
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So effectively, phytochrome is the
molecule that triggers plants to get tall
[SPEAKER_00]: and short, triggers perception of shade
and our understanding of how colors affect
[SPEAKER_00]: that is been inadequate in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important consideration in all this is
does light pollution cause hermaphrodites
[SPEAKER_00]: and hermaphroditic flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of observation suggesting
that it does and there certainly is the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a statistical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you're in the safe zone,
we don't have any evidence that it causes
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things affect hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actively studying that and we'll
talk more about that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: One final thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is human vision and how our
perception of color changes as the light
[SPEAKER_00]: gets dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the photopic curve and that
means how we see colors of light when an
[SPEAKER_00]: area is well lit and the peak here is
right in the middle of the green light and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at green lights at least 10 times
more sensitive than red and blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look what happens when the lights dim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our rods and cones adjust and this is
called the Purkin effect and this shifts
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's called the scotopic curve in low
light and now we can see blues and greens
[SPEAKER_00]: better, but look at the reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't see red colors in low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a geranium flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low light, it's less red and even lower
light, you see the flower, but it's gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a function of shifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this slide in here because I think
we're going to see something like this for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They perceive colors differently in very
low light than they do in high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the cutting edge research
that we're doing on light pollution now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep publishing papers and share the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, measure the light so you're
below, so you're into the safe threshold
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you in a next episode.
