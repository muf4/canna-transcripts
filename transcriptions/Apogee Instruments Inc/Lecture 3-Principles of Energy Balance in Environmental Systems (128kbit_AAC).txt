[SPEAKER_00]: and I welcome everyone back to lecture
number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about long wave today
and then hopefully I made an outline here
[SPEAKER_00]: today of the objective for the next 50
minutes or so to get to total net
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I start and then so we're somewhere
in here we get these two years ago I made
[SPEAKER_00]: a small error and people say there are no
small errors, there's no small typos,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's typos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday when I did this we have a
thousand in and 50% reflected so 50% was
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed so the short wave in was 500
that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reflection right here is a hundred
and I said well we have a hundred that
[SPEAKER_00]: means 600 watts are absorbed but some
people correctly said wait a minute this
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred is also times one minus the albedo
and so this really is 50 and the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: answer is 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not 600, 550 thank you this is over here
500 plus 50, 550 and this 50 is quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of energy so it's not really a small
error but it's also it's important that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is correct because sometimes this
reflection is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get something on the south side of
a building this reflected energy can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more than 10% in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example it's not so big but it
depends on the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this diagram up here with
arrows in and arrows out and this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty messy diagram but it's useful to
have diagrams like this because it helps
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep track of the inputs and the
outputs so some years ago we made this
[SPEAKER_00]: diagram and I have this as a handout the
inputs and the outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go up just slightly to see the
whole works there it is and all this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: nicer diagram of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the sun's on the right hand side
now but solar in with this arrow we've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about this is sky radiation coming
in here which we didn't talk about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's solar in, some bounces off,
here's reflected same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These big fat curvy lines we're going to
talk about today long wave radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: calculating these and then of course we
get outgoing transpiration, conduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: convection and here's some long wave
components here coming into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long wave means the wavelengths are long
and so we draw those with curvy lines and
[SPEAKER_00]: short wave is the wavelength are short so
we draw those with straight lines and then
[SPEAKER_00]: finally here's soil heat flux when we
calculate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a diagram to keep the component
straight and then the goal then in a
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative sense is put numbers on the
arrows and add them up make sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: balances.
[SPEAKER_00]: This issue of a diagram is something that
everybody that teaches this make some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of their own diagram of their own and here
is Park Nobel's diagram of exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing out of this chapter that we're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly different arrows and it's in some
ways these real fat arrows for infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation kind of over emphasize if you
scale these to the rough size of their
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers the biggest arrow in here would be
direct radiation right there coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: the system that's ultimately what drives
the whole thing but these are diagrams to
[SPEAKER_00]: help people see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the one I love so I read this
stuff every time a new textbooks comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: I read the chapter on radiation and I
think all that's a nice diagram and this
[SPEAKER_00]: explains it a little better and you know I
keep thinking of other ways to teach it
[SPEAKER_00]: but one of my favorites is the textbook
that we use on campus animal physiology
[SPEAKER_00]: the third edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you turn to chapter 16 animal
energetics and temperature relations and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not just metabolism because
respiration is big in animals much bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than people but so is all the fluxes of
longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you turn the page to this author's
diagram this I just love this hippopotamus
[SPEAKER_00]: with the exact same arrows reflected he's
got a little tiny bit of evaporation
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared thermal radiation so the point to
this is everybody's got their diagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get these principles you start
applying them to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hot tool laid out in the Sun and how hot
it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even calculate how fast your
laundry will dry on the clothesline
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the wind speed and solar
radiation from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we left off oh I have one more
diagram I want to show you before we get
[SPEAKER_00]: there a couple from the book to link this
to the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here was my picture yesterday of shortwave
and all the components and then this big
[SPEAKER_00]: clump of thermal longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Park Nobel has that diagram as well in
the book only I like my diagram a little
[SPEAKER_00]: better than his because he shows the same
thing but he has it on a log scale and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not a big fan of log scales for teaching
because they distort things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at his infrared radiation by the
leaf it looks like this sharp peak and if
[SPEAKER_00]: this was not a log scale it looks like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same data direct solar and he
has some reflected skylight in here and he
[SPEAKER_00]: also shows wave number wavelength is
simpler but it's still relative fluxes and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at it long enough it's the
exact same diagram just the log scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has this diagram which was on the
bottom of one of the handouts for this
[SPEAKER_00]: Stefan Boltzmann equation radiation
emitted in watts per meter squared and
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: An important thing about this this is a
nice big diagram but if you put a pencil
[SPEAKER_00]: on here and you put a ruler on here and
you put 25 degrees you're pretty close to
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 watts per meter squared which is
useful to remember because we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a thousand here but we're talking
about fluxes of 400 in long wave so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not trivial fluxes at room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would all be terrific if we just
calculated temperature, we multiplied it
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Stefan Boltzmann constant and we
could get our long wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of long wave radiation not
everything is a perfect black body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything is perfectly black and
radiates a black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shiny objects do not emit long wave
radiation very well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get an additional symbol in here
it's lowercase e called emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity is one for a perfect black body
and the opposite extreme is a piece of tin
[SPEAKER_00]: foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best common thing I can think of that
has a low emissivity and somewhere right
[SPEAKER_00]: here I have a piece of tin foil to
emphasize this point and here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have two things that are confusing,
albedo which refers to short wave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, reflectance of short wave and
then this thing emissivity which only
[SPEAKER_00]: refers to long wave radiation and again
long wave is warm objects, all objects
[SPEAKER_00]: that are less hot than the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our environment the only thing that's
any significant source of short wave is
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun and then all the terrestrial objects
are all back and forth long wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put this up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to erase this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three objects and my goal is that ten
years from now you'll still remember this
[SPEAKER_00]: little demonstration and it'll stick in
your head and you'll have it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tin foil aluminum foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's my marker?
Albedo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty reflective of short wave radiation
so we might say and it depends on how
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect the tin foil is if it's got
crinkles but if it's pretty perfect it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have an albedo of 0.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can look this up in a book to see
exactly what people claim for this but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's do just doing albedos for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albedo 0.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might even be blacker than that but 0.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we do white paper and instead of
drawing a square I'm putting actual white
[SPEAKER_00]: paper up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's white paper and if this was a test
question hundred percent people would get
[SPEAKER_00]: this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The albedo of this is about 0.9 plus or
minus 0.05 or something for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay now let's do right below this giving
ourselves plenty of room to see it
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely different concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is emitted from the surface so this
as the surface gets warm it's the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to give off long wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A black body this depending on how black
it is this might be 0.9 for the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: give off not white paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think white paper would be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well hardy can emit right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the opposite of black.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: White paper might be 0.85 maybe even 0.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: A white surface is a fine emitter similar
to black but now let's take a shiny
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of polished metal that's shiny
the emissivity of aluminum foil 0.03.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a clean piece of aluminum foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shiny surfaces are poor emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean for energy balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was hot and again let's imagine
we're on the moon where there's no air
[SPEAKER_00]: because it simplifies it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put this on a stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lay it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take forever for this to cool off
by emitted radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a block of metal now right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take another block of metal that's
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat it up exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lay it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cools off right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with white.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cool off right away because they can
emit that radiation into space into other
[SPEAKER_00]: objects on the ground and the moon
simplifies it because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration, conduction, and convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little diagram helps to emphasize
the differences in emissivity and now we
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to sacrifice part of this leaf
right here to science because the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: we're after is leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant just gave part of its life for
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical albedo of a leaf and I'll put this
one in green 0.25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in greens in between black and white
but has a much lower albedo than white
[SPEAKER_00]: paper would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not completely intuitive from this but the
typical value we use for leaf is 0.96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves emit, effectively emit radiation
which also means they can effectively cool
[SPEAKER_00]: off when they, as soon as they get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth putting on here one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to erase this.
This.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is blue right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to put a blue square
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's full of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water has an emissivity
[SPEAKER_00]: of about 0.96, maybe even 0.98.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why biological objects that are
full of water like our skin have very high
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that are hydrated and wet
effectively emit longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The albedo of water depends a lot on sun
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's low sun angle, you get glare and a
lot of reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how clear the water is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to put a number in here for
albedo but the point is water is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: effective emitter of longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the concept of emissivity and one
of the things that I think of when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about this is where if we're
designing wood stoves to heat the cabin
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere, we would not want to build the
wood stove out of aluminum foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd sit there and get hot and if you
walked into the room and tried to find
[SPEAKER_00]: that wood stove you wouldn't tell where it
is but wood stoves are black and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: effective emitters so as soon as a wood
stove gets hot it's given off its heat to
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would think there's a lot of things
in between here between these two for
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivities and there are but not as many
as you might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All polished metals have low emissivity
but most building materials, bricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: white walls, stucco walls are all up in a
higher emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only things that are really low are
shiny objects but they're a nice example
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we just, gee you just told us
we can ignore photosynthesis, why don't we
[SPEAKER_00]: round this off to one significant digit
and just call it one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes we would if this was radiation physics
101 but this is radiation physics 501 and
[SPEAKER_00]: this number matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's multiplied by hundreds of watts per
meter squared so small changes in this
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplier make a big difference for
energy balance and it's worth putting
[SPEAKER_00]: those numbers in.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way snow is like this, good emitter
of long wave and reflects short wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never actually taught this with the
live leaf taped on the board before but it
[SPEAKER_00]: helps show the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we have this we can start to
assemble our energy balance model with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the components of long wave radiation in
addition to short wave because we just ran
[SPEAKER_00]: our model and we'll erase some of this and
we will say in red radiation short wave
[SPEAKER_00]: comma absorbed is 550.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'd like to do radiation long wave
incident, first incident on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: This line is incident on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much long wave is coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two sources of our long wave
particularly since our leaf is a flat leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: above the ground, a nice simple example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our flat leaf right here and I'm
going to even take that part off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have ground shown in black,
long wave coming up to the leaf from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say the ground, now I have a
handout that assimilates these and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to want to follow the same numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to assume a ground temperature,
measure it or assume it and in this case I
[SPEAKER_00]: assumed 27 degrees C for the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we plug that number in and if I'm
lucky I can find my chart of long wave
[SPEAKER_00]: chart from yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd that go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody have that handy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the table of, yeah you can look it
up but I want everybody to, thanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ground's 27 460 but, so 460 for this
part right here, 460 T to the fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin but we have to assume, measure or
assume an emissivity of the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to take, I don't have a lot of
room but you can see it here, times 0.9
[SPEAKER_00]: for the emissivity of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that radiation going up is 414.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these units are in watts per meter
squared so that leaf is absorbing or is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting 414 from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a horizontal leaf so it's also
getting radiation from the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would think the sky temperature on
a warm day might, the air temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: might be 27 degrees C and you would think,
well about the same as the ground then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the air molecules are 27 we could do
the same thing and it would be 414 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is how much long wave is from
the Sun and the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a radiometer, good radiometer
and point it right at the Sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the same temperature as the open
sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: None.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing and it's so
counter-intuitive you almost have to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: out with the instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's baloney, I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And point it at the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after class take an instrument and go
do that test and convince yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that Sun is short wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short wave is one dot in the sky
and the whole rest of the sky is emitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though the air molecules might be
27 degrees C, radiation, the atmosphere is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty transparent to long wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was perfectly transparent,
like say on the Moon, it would be zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outer space is zero Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be zero, but we don't get zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make careful measurements of this and
we get cold sky temperatures somewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: between room temperature and zero and we
call that the effective sky temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends somewhat on elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's colder skies at high elevation
because there's less air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on relative humidity a bit
because the water vapor molecules affect
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but typically from a sky we'll get 300
watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a clear sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did we use this to get the clear sky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's the effective emissivity of
the air?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the effective temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these interact to give us this
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is generally a measured number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't depend on air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how clear the sky is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouds, let's take a case with clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get rid of this zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear sky, which is what we're doing this
model for right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have to be a black
thundercloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a perfectly white nice cloud in
the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go out with our instruments and
point it at the cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouds are relatively close to the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're full of water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are in fact reading the
temperature of the water vapor molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cloud and pretty often a cloud will
jump up to maybe 400 watts per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's close to the ground and the
molecules in the cloud are warm and we no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer see the infinity of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a real heavy cloud,
this can get all the way up to over 400
[SPEAKER_00]: for a cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big difference between cloudy
skies and sunny skies for longwave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything else we do from the
emissivity of the surface and the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, but clouds and sky
temperature, we just measure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's been measured many times and so
we know approximately what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start adding up these numbers now
for radiation in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get 550 absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is 414 plus 300 would be 714
watts per meter squared radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one other calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.96 is the emissivity of a surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity equals
[SPEAKER_00]: absorptivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: rp equals a.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that if a surface is 0.96 for
emitting radiation, it's also 0.96 for
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbing that same radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if 714 is coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's put this right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 714 in, we have to multiply that by 0.96
for the absorptivity of the leaf and that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out to 685.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that number is the energy absorbed by
the leaf in longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is radiation longwave absorbed in
this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we sum that, 685 with 550 here,
r longwave absorbed, 685.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the staggering message is, wow,
there is more longwave absorbed by that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf than shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sun is hot, you go outside and you
think, wow, how can this be?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the sum?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1235.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe in radiation 101, you would say,
wow, they have to evaporate enough water
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of this energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But longwave works both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this longwave is coming into this leaf
from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wait a minute, what's the leaf
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assumed a leaf temperature of 25 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how much is leaving that leaf by
longwave and we look up on our chart,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, 448.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, I'm going to put this over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a leaf, 25, 448 times 0.96,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 430, 430.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say, whew, good, we can subtract
430 from this and the leaf doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate so much water, but it gets even
better than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation doesn't just go down,
radiation can go up too from the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: both up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the downside is 430 and the up is also
430.
[SPEAKER_00]: So radiation longwave emitted is 860 watts
per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me erase some older stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start to do a sum of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have total radiation absorbed,
1235.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation emitted,
[SPEAKER_00]: 860.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we subtract it, 375 watts per meter
squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the final answer, no other
add-ons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how much water that leaf has to
evaporate to stay at air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big numbers coming in because this is
shortwave and longwave, but big numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: going out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about this, this energy
balance right here between the leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground, if ground and the leaf might
be close to the same temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is always fairly tiny,
the net between the ground, but the sky is
[SPEAKER_00]: colder than the ground if it's clear,
so we can lose energy by longwave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation to the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps on a clear day it helps
keep leaves cool because they're emitting
[SPEAKER_00]: to the clear sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the components and what we
calculated was, well we didn't explicitly
[SPEAKER_00]: do net longwave, but we could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 685 in and 860 out for longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the net longwave is a negative
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is always a negative number if the
sky is clear, we're losing more longwave,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're losing heat by longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having worked through this,
step-by-step, using the same inputs as
[SPEAKER_00]: this, here's a worked out example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully with your help, getting done
the math, we got the same number as the
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means either we had corresponding
errors or everything's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the inputs and outputs that
you always use to determine radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: balance for any object leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these numbers are all big,
the stuff coming in and going out is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think maybe we would like to
have leaves kind of like tinfoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't they evolve like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well once they get hot they can't get rid
of the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not be so good because they're
shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to have leaves something like
this and they're not absorbing the heat in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first place and then they're emitting
longwave to stay cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a, I'm thinking about this and
teaching it over the years and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about how do you give examples to
drive home the power of longwave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to give you, let's see,
I'm going to take these down, there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: room up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if, well here's a, this is a
well-known thing from Boy Scouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a cold clear night in the
mountains, go sleep under a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be warmer and the Boy Scouts are,
you know, but if you went out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: did the net radiation, the tree is way
warmer than sleeping outside under the
[SPEAKER_00]: clear sky because of the radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have one with me but if I did,
it would be a great example, a space
[SPEAKER_00]: blanket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how can they help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, they help you doubly because they're
shiny on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your body heat gets reflected back in
and this does not emit to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why space blankets are so
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing to do with conduction and
convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all radiation physics, keeping the
warm temperature in.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, yeah, you know, my grandmother
always says put the dull side out and
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes in the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read on, people argue about that
stuff online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out it just doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dull side is really close to the
outside and, you know, they're both low
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is the case, why do you wrap
potatoes in aluminum foil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, jeez, I mean the radiation from
the oven is not contributing to heating up
[SPEAKER_00]: the potato to keep the moisture in for the
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very effective to keep the
moisture in even though it makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes cook more slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all radiation physics in the
kitchen and we can go on and on about all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cool examples in a kitchen of cooking
food and radiation physics, health ass is
[SPEAKER_00]: my food going to cook in an oven?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the walls of the temperature of the
oven?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no shortwave in an oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all radiation physics and it's helped
now with convection ovens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn a fan on so we get some convection
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the example that drives home
the power of longwave radiation and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: draw a diagram of this and then you can
tell me what you think is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to build a box or a cylinder
and we'll make it out of styrofoam,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue styrofoam, something that's a very
effective insulator and a couple feet tall
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the bottom of this we're going to
put a bowl with water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thin layer of water and by the way the
bowl is painted flat black.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surface of the bowl is painted flat
black, water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take this outside, it's a simple
device, take this outside like tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot but the temperature might get
down to 20-25 C tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take it outside under a clear sky and
it's calm winds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen to the temperature
of that water?
[SPEAKER_00]: The room temperature when brought it
outside, it's going to radiate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: infinity of space and the hole inside of
this is going to radiate to the infinity
[SPEAKER_00]: of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get colder and colder and conduction
and convection can't warm it back up
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have a big insulated cylinder
and if it's windy we could put a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: cellophane on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real thin cellophane transmits longwave
but it works good even without this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it gets colder and colder and its
radiation is coming in from the sky,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a clear night and the sky
temperature, I put 300 as an average but
[SPEAKER_00]: around here and I've got some examples of
this, this sky temperature can be more
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know if I've seen 200 but
250 watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, do you remember low numbers from sky
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say 250 for summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now radiation, we have to follow the first
law of thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So energy in equals energy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this keeps going until these two arrows
are exactly the same size and if 250 is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in, 250 has to be going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the temperature of the water on a
hot summer night in Logan if 250 is the
[SPEAKER_00]: emitted radiation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to our table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water freezes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It easily freezes and this is so
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would freeze even if the sky was 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd get below zero and the water would
freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the power of longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is so cool After I thought of
this, I had to go do it and this is my
[SPEAKER_00]: house, my backyard patio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll zoom in on this so we can get this
really big in here and I got some blue
[SPEAKER_00]: styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it once and it didn't get super cold
and I kept doing it and I got bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: layers and I made this longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a fine net radiometer right up
here so I can see how this is coming along
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can tell this is a long time ago
because this is like an old 8088 computer
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is my daughter who is now 26
years old and a little pump to inflate the
[SPEAKER_00]: domes and that thing and right in here is
a Campbell scientific data logger with
[SPEAKER_00]: thermocouples in the water and
thermocouples all over and I'm watching a
[SPEAKER_00]: very primitive graph of the temperature in
this thing and my wife came out and took a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture and it wasn't dark yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun was just setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got that water to freeze but I got
it to like one degree C.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's radiation physics and in fact this
is such a powerful principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I thought of it is because
people make refrigerators in the tropics
[SPEAKER_00]: just like this and they open them at night
and they have blocks of water in here and
[SPEAKER_00]: they get cool at night and then they close
them in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep food cold just by radiation
cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact you could run this in the day if
you kept pointing it away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight because the sky is clear in the
night and the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of other examples of this
and since this particular audience is
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument-intensive now we'll show some
actual data and I'm going to zoom out just
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave this as a test question to students
after I talked about this principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is last winter, January 11th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one week to January 17th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on-campus net radiation and first
of all it's measured albedo because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have radiation in, radiation out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to know here is on these
days the snow had melted off and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly dead grass is January but it wasn't
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we say the albedo of grass was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 0.25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to see on this scale but there's
about 0.25 for these days here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are night by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just zero in, zero out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had this big spike that went to
two and if you weren't an instrumentation
[SPEAKER_00]: person you're going to go, wow,
two times as much shortwave radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving as coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could have caused that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This giant spike right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're living in the area you would
remember what the weather was like but
[SPEAKER_00]: here is why that thing spiked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Peter Sinks at the same time and
there's a bunch of snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Huxa flux net radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortwave in, longwave out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The shortwave in is blocked so of course
it goes to two because the bottom one is
[SPEAKER_00]: not blocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get issues like this and you just have
to understand the things that may give you
[SPEAKER_00]: bad data and filter them out of the data
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was a little more organized I'd show
you the exact picture of the campus
[SPEAKER_00]: station at the same time because it
happens every time it snows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that reason we put heaters in sensors
whenever we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heaters are expensive so it's hard to run
them off a solar power and then when it
[SPEAKER_00]: snows you get snow in your solar panel and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one little silicon pyranometer
with the heater that kept reading
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly during that snowstorm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we would have had two of these in that
system we would not have had this artifact
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, this albedo of two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here the snow melted and it's a
little not completely melted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at the albedo of this surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: No snow, snows, 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the snow did what it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reflected shortwave radiation and then
we got some, I think we got more snow but
[SPEAKER_00]: it better jump from is a nice example of
no snow and snow on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some numbers for incoming longwave
so Mark said we can get down to 200 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very clear sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longwave was 200 watts per meter
squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a cloudy sky and we're up around
320 and whenever it gets clear the sky
[SPEAKER_00]: gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outgoing longwave is just based on the
temperature of the ground and that's this
[SPEAKER_00]: purple line and you can tell the
temperature of the ground because the
[SPEAKER_00]: outgoing longwave was 280 to 300 which is
right just slightly below zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surface of the snow up there was
probably minus three degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these graphs are on the internet and
I'm going to put the location right here
[SPEAKER_00]: because as soon as you know the principles
you can watch these graphs and say yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why this is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at weather.usu.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a whole series of graphs of all
these principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many more but this is one of them
and I use these all the time as test
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say here's the weather last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain this graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why'd this go up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why'd this go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to look at ratios of different
graphs to see what's going on but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really helpful to drive all this radiation
physics into your head to see examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different graph but ground
temperature, equivalent sky temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sky temperature up here is the
equivalent of minus 22 C.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the combination of effective
emissivity in sky temperature and we call
[SPEAKER_00]: that equivalent sky temperature and then
net is just the difference and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever the net is a really low number
that means it's a clear sky and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero cloudy skies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of clouds in this period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The net radiation was zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clouds were just as warm as the cold
surface in the winter or in the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a handout of this but I'm
always looking for teaching examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is, can move this up a little,
a picture here to be really right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put that part off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of a stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit blurry but this is all
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the middle of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to tell you this was up Logan
Canyon but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dark rock and look at the melting of the
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the shadow of the rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bright day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the melting of the snow right
around the rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: What made that snow melt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflected shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait a minute, the rock is really dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hardly any reflected shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day that rock absorbed the shortwave
like crazy and got warm above the air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and all night long is emitting
longwave radiation and melting the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is longwave radiation melting the
snow from a warm rock not reflected
[SPEAKER_00]: shortwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what then I put that down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longwave radiation emitted from a stone
and you can see it's not super warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably melting this a few
millimeters every day until it snows again
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's warm enough to melt the snow by
the longwave because net radiation is such
[SPEAKER_00]: a big factor in everything with energy
balance and because by the way now we have
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this stuff feeds into one thing and
we'll put it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our whole equation goes to our net and
this is absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equals t plus c squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those components that feed into this
give us one number and so to put numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: on this 375 equals t plus the sum of t
plus c squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once this is a tough number to get at
because of all the factors we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: but once we get it wow there's only two
components that can go into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the theory but not surprisingly
companies have built instruments to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure this number to make this easy and
to help people understand those
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments we made another refrigerator
magnet and you can put it on your filing
[SPEAKER_00]: cabinet and look at it and every time
things seem a little goofy and this has
[SPEAKER_00]: got two sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is, I can zoom in a hair,
two sides summer and winter and it's great
[SPEAKER_00]: because these fluxes are so different and
it's got shortwave and long waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these principles we've been talking
about for two days are all right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousand in, now 200 out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the albedo is 0.2 in this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice round number.
[SPEAKER_00]: The net for this is 800 because sums
reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's long wave 450.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is roughly what would 450 be 24 c
or something right around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Net minus 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: So net and net 650 watts per meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Square for a fully vegetated surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case this is not a single leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have transmitted radiation to
the ground because it's fully all those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf layers are all absorbing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also don't have two sides to radiate
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it was radiating down but here the
ground and the leaves are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to get rid of 450 watts per
meter squared in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter, much lower input.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the sun, anatomically correct
sun sank in the sky a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 in, snow 350 out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the net's only 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter, no wonder it's cold in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long wave, the snow is cold so only 300
and a little bit less long wave from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Net 50 or net plus 50, net minus 50,
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not warming up on days like this
in the winter, largely because of the snow
[SPEAKER_00]: cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we finally get some warm air to help
melt the snow and then the whole warming
[SPEAKER_00]: starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this little refrigerator magnet helps
it understand the magnitudes of the fluxes
[SPEAKER_00]: in two very different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop here and pick this up
tomorrow when I think at this point the
[SPEAKER_00]: next thing I want to do is apply this to
the whole planet Earth for energy balance
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Earth because we're an independent
system orbiting through the vacuum of
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not losing heat by conduction and
convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Earth isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not losing or gaining heat by
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water we have stays in the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we have is radiation physics to the
rest of the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that doesn't balance, if this whole
thing, if net radiation isn't zero point
[SPEAKER_00]: zero zero for the Earth, we're either
going to cool off or warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that you have these principles in
place, now we can take and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluxes for the whole Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this in a nutshell is the essence of
global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I can explain to you why
that's complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why the smartest people in the world are
doing global warming right now to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: see is this number really zero?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how far off of zero?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all radiation physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll stop here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirk.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the subject of many PhD theses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, well, you got to start with one
thing that we understand really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say, okay, here's that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to tilt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that happens is
multiple tilted leaves don't reflect quite
[SPEAKER_00]: as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we just said here, the transmission
to the ground is much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't affect it as much as you
might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you still have reflected short
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the long wave is just from the
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter that they're all
vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one flat leaf has the same effective
radiation as 100 vertical leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as they're covering the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That orientation doesn't matter for the
emission of long wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing for absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing with tilting leaves is
reflection is a short wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it bounces and captures it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any rough surface would absorb better than
a smooth polished surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's part of the reason that
polished metal has such a low emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When polished metal oxidizes, like copper,
it goes green.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, polished copper is 0.03.
[SPEAKER_00]: It oxidizes and goes green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's 0.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that surface is rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a similar thing to leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure of the surface affects the
reflection of short wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: With vertical leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me add to this answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said 1,000 watts per meter squared for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually never thought of this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only happens if the leaf is
perpendicular to the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Sun is only perpendicular to the
ground at the equator at the right time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I probably should do this example with
a flat leaf and an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it wouldn't be 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was really close to the Sun,
it'd be a lot less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, that angle definitely matters
being perpendicular to the light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this brings us to an instrumentation
tidbit that is not well understood by
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we build or use instruments,
here's an instrument, and here's some
[SPEAKER_00]: white disc up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're various shapes of curved
domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we say these are cosine corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody says, okay, cosine
corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that if you put a reference light
here, you would get, let's say we did this
[SPEAKER_00]: and we got 1,000 watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we took that same light and we put it
at some low angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this sensor still reads 1,000,
it's not cosine corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to read less by the cosine of this
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a low angle, the correct number
might be, say, 100, the correct number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it reads 200, it's not cosine
corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it reads 50, it's also not cosine
corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be the right ratio of tilted
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we make a graph of this,
there's one of these graphs on the Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to think this goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this graph is, let me see,
nope, this is radiation here and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here is 90 degrees and that
sensor should read 0 because everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: missing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's 0 degrees and this might be 100
or 1,000 depending on the units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a theoretically perfect cosine
response that says at each lower angle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the reading of the instrument should read
somewhat less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to think many years ago that
all the instruments went like that and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were wrong because they didn't
capture the low angle right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I know it's just as easy to make a
sensor that goes like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get too much low angle light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can underdo it or overdo it and any
instrument has to have the right optics to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow this line as closely as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theoretically perfect cosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too low, not too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We calibrate our instruments right here
and then we hope all those angles are
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get it right for an
instrument, it's reproducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, in the summer, most of the sunlight
is in this range here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in high angles and it's not too hard
to get an instrument to follow this at
[SPEAKER_00]: these angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really hard to get the instrument
to keep following it right to zero and in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact, none of our instruments get this
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest end Kippen's Onan instruments
aren't perfect, none of them are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they get close.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to deviate right down here from
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't too critical because this
is low angle light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be off by 5% but it's 5% of a
small number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here you better be right on
because it's a big number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is cosine correction and I think
this speaks to your example of angles in
[SPEAKER_00]: here and what happens when you tilt
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it change it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But our instruments measure, it's by
definition, what would the radiation be on
[SPEAKER_00]: a flat surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to calculate the radiation
on a tilted surface, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little trigonometry and like Mark just
pointed out, if you tilt it, it goes above
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one way to explain the effect
of tilted surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for an instrument but you can
also use this for any surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would it be tilted toward the Sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you made your measurement flat,
you could predict the increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation from tilting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, really good question and the answer
is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let me answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to erase and give myself a tiny bit
more room.
[SPEAKER_00]: A leaf in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to bring in a way giant
microscope and leaves are half air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this marker, green marker,
yeah that's good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this as some beginning plant
physiology and then you get stomates in
[SPEAKER_00]: here like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every plant biology book has a diagram
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's full of air and these aren't as
probably as quite as dense as I drew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have light coming right through and
it bounces around and it bounces out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have light coming at an angle
and it bounces a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the transmission of light coming at an
angle is way less.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflection is more because it's a low
angle but the transmission is less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we study penetration of light into
leaves at different angles and the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: the light the less the transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one part of this goes down and another
part goes up, which is partly why we get
[SPEAKER_00]: away with saying 0.5 because there's some
offsetting changes in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general the transmission at low
angles goes down faster than this goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact when we get to whole canopies
you can imagine how much math you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and analyze this with all the
angles and people have worked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another way is just to put a net
radiometer out there and just measure it
[SPEAKER_00]: and say the sum of all these is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a theoretical treatment and
then there's the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your instrument's good you're going
to nail these fluxes on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great example of why net
radiation is so valuable but net
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometers are more expensive instruments
so few people use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they don't use them they're
trying to model these fluxes, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure this big one and then you
try to model the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some years ago Rick Allen,
he was here at the University for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's at Kimberly Idaho but he wrote
part of a book chapter and after testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time, a bunch of instruments for
net radiation, he said these instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: have sufficient problems that it's more
accurate to model the net radiation fluxes
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is to measure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sentence in that, it's a chapter
in a book I think, it's FAO 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then Blanquist et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: did a big study with a bunch of net
radiometers and as I recall nearly all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the net radiometers were more accurate
than the models.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only ones that weren't were the very
cheapest models.
[SPEAKER_00]: All, even the cheapest net radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's evolution of instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're better and cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, you can see if you can get this
number right with an instrument,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, you're really, you're getting there
because now you just got a couple other
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, if a user just puts
the instrument out there without any
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of all this stuff,
they have no idea when they're collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: bad data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you understand the stuff,
you can look at the lines and say this
[SPEAKER_00]: can't be right, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd better go check the instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's worth a lot to have that
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think they would have a huge
effect on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask the true-false of the
population, you know, the evidence of what
[SPEAKER_00]: does, they have a huge effect on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go out with our radiometers and
measure this, there's hazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those inversions are 1, 2, 300 meters
thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look sideways at the mountains,
you can see the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now go out in an inversion and look up and
tell me if you can see the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not deep enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, the sky looks fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be looking through an air mass
of several, two or three or four to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this incoming shortwave is actually
hard to measure during, I mean hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell that there's an inversion based on
attenuation of shortwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had one, I don't know, four or five
hundred meters up and one at the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could see it, but it's hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this tells you why we get cold
inversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow on the ground and we can't heat the
ground up because there's snow on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some because there's crap in the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all keep studying the website PM 2.5
and we say, wow, this is a terrible day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the units on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, micrograms per cubic meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, a microgram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean a paperclip is a gram and so this
is a millionth of a paperclip per meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weight of the particles is tiny and
even though they're bad for our lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no doubt about that, the optical
effects are smaller than you might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these fluxes don't change much from
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They change more with humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity can be three, four percent of
the, well in the winter it might be one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two percent, but humidity is many orders
of magnitude greater than the PM 2.5 and
[SPEAKER_00]: small changes in humidity would have a
bigger effect than big changes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are examples of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would this apply to different things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow we'll model planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, I promised a key for E equals MC
squared, which I already showed you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good example of a question where
you can't rely on your intuition to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to follow the rules and get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan, tape this back on.
