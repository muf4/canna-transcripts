[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Skyler Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with the integrator and technical
support team here at Apti Instruments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're here to talk about connecting
our SP214 pyranometer to the SMA Cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: Controller, a very popular controller for
use in commercial solar applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP214 is an irradiant sensor in order
to see the watts per meter squared
[SPEAKER_00]: available from the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the first thing to note is the SP214
comes like this with a 4-inch pigtail to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the sensor does need to be powered,
24 volts power supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you need to know where your power
supply is and then how far away that is
[SPEAKER_00]: from your X8 terminal on the Cluster
Controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending upon the distance, you may need
to split the jacket like so, and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the red and black over here that will
power the sensor, and the green and white
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the sensor output that will
connect into the controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll go ahead and right here,
in our example, we'll connect the red into
[SPEAKER_00]: the positive on the power supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we just slide that down in there,
and this is just a regular screw on
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we will slide it in and tighten that
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the black will go in the
negative, and same thing, we will just
[SPEAKER_00]: tighten him down.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here on the controller
itself, we are on X8 and the top row is
[SPEAKER_00]: A2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're going to go in A2 for the white
conductor, A3 for the green conductor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are just push-in terminals,
so they just push in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our shield, we will go into
A4.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's how you wire up the sensor
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to change the
installation curve, and you do that
[SPEAKER_00]: through the user interface for the SMA
Cluster Controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, once you have that interface
pulled up on your computer, navigate to
[SPEAKER_00]: meteorology, and then go to environmental,
and then go to irradiance sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go to characteristic curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're there, you just need to
change it to 0 to 1250 watts per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a reminder, this is a 4 to 20
milliamp sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way that you can look at this is
on the controller itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you scroll down a number of times,
then you get to analog inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analog current input number one on the top
there is showing us what the data is
[SPEAKER_00]: reading from the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our example here, it's reading 4.01
milliamp, which is correct for our studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is very little light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we hit down two more times,
we can see the installation converting
[SPEAKER_00]: that to one watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: For normal applications, you'll probably
be reading between 7 to 11 milliamps,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your time of day and
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: That concludes our SP214 pyranometer
connecting to the SMA Cluster Controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to watch our other segment on
connecting our TS100 aspirated radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: shield to the Cluster Controller to get
very accurate ambient air temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thanks for watching.
