[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, Professor of Crop
Physiology at Utah State University and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have been asked so often by home growers
what are the optimal conditions to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video I'm going to go through
all of the environmental, all of the key
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental parameters and the ways that
we measure them here in a research
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory and ways that you can measure
them at home to get optimal conditions for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a license to study medical hemp
here at Utah State University so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take those principles and now
scale them down for home use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we often talk
about are the nine cardinal parameters for
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth and I drew a little plant
here to give you a sense of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put the parameters on here and then
we'll talk about each of them in turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with temperature, I'm going to
just put temp over here, then we'll put
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, then we'll put wind and inside
we usually call that air velocity,
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 and we put breath brackets around that
to show CO2 concentration, how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it, what are optimum levels and
now we go underground and to get this just
[SPEAKER_00]: right we go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have temperature down here in the
root zone, we certainly have water in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone, nutrients and then finally
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our parameters, you can pretty
quickly see that's only eight parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light we put up here, L-I-G-H-T,
it's enormous, it's coming from all
[SPEAKER_00]: directions, it affects everything in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we turn up the light, the water flux
through the plant goes up, the optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of other things change,
so to optimize growth we have to start by
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizing light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this same diagram is over here,
I've shown this many times in talks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I want to show you is a little
bit of data from our laboratory on a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of cultivars, here we can zoom in
on this baby, get it big.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of cultivars, this is yield and
this is an input parameter called DLI,
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily Light Integral and what I'm going to
show you right now is how to measure this
[SPEAKER_00]: because the higher the number,
the higher the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a curved line but look at these
numbers are still going up as we approach
[SPEAKER_00]: 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 60 is a sunny summer day, no clouds at
all, in the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the brightest day of the year and
hemp benefits from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always have to grow it here,
it'll grow fine down around 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you want to get maximum yield we
need to push it hard with light and if we
[SPEAKER_00]: push it hard with light we have to
optimize everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the calculations for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we measure light we take a ordinary
quantum sensor and measure it and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just have a quantum sensor with a meter
you're going to get a unit of,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one's done, you're going to get a
unit of micro moles of photons per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared of area per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the standard unit from quantum
sensors and what the I in integral means
[SPEAKER_00]: is you add this up over a whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take a quantum sensor and we
measure 1,000, now this is bright,
[SPEAKER_00]: bright light, is it pushing the plant hard
with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to, over here we're going to get to
moles per meter squared per day and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is what's called daily light integral and
the way we get there is just to add up the
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 3,600 seconds per hour and so we
multiply those together and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 times 3,000 we get 3.6 times 10 to
the 6th micro moles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 10 to the 6 micro moles is one mole,
micro is 10 to the minus 6, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.6, sorry this is per hour right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seconds canceled, 3.6 moles per meter
squared per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world of cannabis we need short
days to get the plants to flower and make
[SPEAKER_00]: good flower buds and to do that I think
most people know to be safe we go with 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hour photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we multiply these together,
12 hours, 12 times 3.6 is 43.2 moles per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you get the daily light
integral after you measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now used to be you had to do some math
after you did this to calculate this but
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is so important companies
have developed instruments to add it up
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously and here's one made by Apogee
instruments, it's connected to this
[SPEAKER_00]: device, this is a quantum sensor and this
measures the light and adds it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's Bluetooth shows it on your
phone and what this is showing is the
[SPEAKER_00]: daily light integral each day and this was
outside recently so you can see we got up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 35, this is in the spring of the year,
cloudy days are five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside we'd have a constant light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is really critical because we
want 12 hours and at night we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: any light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of light leaking in can cause
cannabis to not flower at all or flower
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly so this instrument is like a silent
sentinel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's watching all the time, make sure the
light is correct in the day and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's off and dark at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows a whole bunch of screens,
I'm not gonna go through them all but it
[SPEAKER_00]: collects data and summarizes it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in addition to this instrument,
how hard can we push the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: A thousand gave us 43.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's fine, we can grow fine cannabis
at that but if we want to push it we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna need to go up to 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look what happens, if we increase this
to 1500 micromoles everything increases by
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.5, we take this times 1.5 and let's see,
that's gonna be 43 plus 22, it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: 62, about 62 micromoles per meter squared
per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're up to where we're pushing it
hard and we get very high yields but boy
[SPEAKER_00]: the other input also have to be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the rest of these parameters
are so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna put near maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've done studies in the laboratory
at 2000 and yield keeps going up at 2000
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's getting really high,
it's hard to keep everything watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the light level, you want to
pinpoint this to make sure it's there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the light level's a lot like a speedometer
in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna take this car out for a
fast drive you sure as heck want an
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate speedometer in it to know exactly
how fast you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you got a lot of other gauges
too but it starts with getting the light
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to measure light with a foot
candle meter or a lux meter but those can
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to big errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to calibrate them against a good
quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stories of people having
troubles with lux meters and it can lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to a difficulty in the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through the other parameters
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're gonna push this crop hard with a
lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, the temperature curve is
about, I'm gonna put 26 to 29 Celsius and
[SPEAKER_00]: now I have to convert this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna, let me change this a little
bit here, make it round numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do 25 to 30 degrees C and in
Fahrenheit that's 77 to 86 F.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a broad range and in this range
you're gonna have pretty optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a lot of light you gotta
have some cooling or you're gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter than 86 and that's definitely not
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at humidity in these
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants produce a lot of humidity and
the key for the humidity is blowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to draw, I could probably
put this up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a light box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our plant down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put the plant on this in green,
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant's putting an enormous amount of
water into the air when the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put H2O here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wanna have some kind of a vent like
this to have the air come in and blow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time the humidity is too high
and that leads to powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the optimal humidity is really,
exactly optimal might be 60% but that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty broad optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow fine plants from 40 to maybe
70% as long as you don't get disease up at
[SPEAKER_00]: the high end of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's humidity and we're venting this
to blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time we're venting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, it's cooling the plant by
venting which is important with all this
[SPEAKER_00]: light to have lots of ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way to tell the ventilation is put
your plant in and measure the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep enough ventilation so you don't
get above 30 Celsius or 85 Fahrenheit and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, get a humidity meter,
put them by the vent, make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get too high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind is, you can get anemometers to
measure wind but generally you just want
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are moving slightly,
that's a good airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's around a meter a second wind speed
and that's what you want to maintain for
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known for, since photosynthesis was
discovered, that CO2 improves crop growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the laboratory we can enrich CO2,
in big commercial operations we enrich
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complicated to enrich at home so we
rarely enrich at home but we're breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: out a lot of CO2 in the house anyway and
the pilot light in a water heater gives
[SPEAKER_00]: out a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I measured CO2 carbon dioxide in my house
and some years ago I found the house never
[SPEAKER_00]: went down to ambient CO2 and after a lot
of testing I finally found out it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: pilot light in my water heater that was
enriching CO2 in the entire house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beneficial to enrich with CO2 but
it's certainly not necessary to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: great crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambient CO2 is now about 400 parts per
million and the challenge with CO2 is to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it from going below 400 and again if
the ventilation is not adequate the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: for a plant is like oxygen for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water vapors coming out,
let's put CO2 as black in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to put CO2 carbon as black.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 is going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have enough ventilation you
deplete the CO2 and the plants basically
[SPEAKER_00]: suffocating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure we get plenty of ventilation
to keep the humidity low, the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: low and then the CO2 will automatically be
close to 400 and that's adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years ago I did a TED talk called
turning water into food and that TED talk
[SPEAKER_00]: was about how much water plants really
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now TED talks are 15 minutes long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take a lot of stuff out to make
it fit but I'm going to show you something
[SPEAKER_00]: that got cut from that TED talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back from high school or beginning
college chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These beads represent the ratio of gases
in our atmosphere and if you know a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about the atmosphere most of its
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is 80% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an inert gas at 79-80% of our
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next biggest gas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20% of the air is oxygen shown here in
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go, let's take this one out for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: These four beads, this one there's 10,000
beads here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the plants have to work with
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these four beads go to three beads the
plant growth suffers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want plenty of aeration going through
your your grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make sure it's adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's water vapor, blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a bit more water vapor than
CO2 but here's the key point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans need oxygen and we got a lot of
oxygen for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants need CO2 and they hardly have any
and that's the whole reason that good
[SPEAKER_00]: supply of air is critical to that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like you can't have a fan
that's too big in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point it's a waste of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just measure temperature and
humidity and keep those down because
[SPEAKER_00]: drawing a scale drawing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the lights and in this box all day
long they're putting a lot of light in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's driving the water, driving the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to blow those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One key thing about light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants need to be dark at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most people line this with silver or
mylar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the light reflect in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure this is dark at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's light pollution, somebody turns
on a light and it leaks in, your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: could not, they might not flower properly
or they might not have good yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this reason, another thing Apogee
developed, it's this sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor here was a light pollution
detector and it's really sensitive to low
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as the other one,
only it detects trace amounts of light
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to keep it good and dark because
here's 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means 12 hours of dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now by the way, we're studying lines that
might take 13 hours, maybe 14 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, but for now to be on the safe side,
12 hours of light and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: To optimize yield, you want to decide,
you want to make a good decision about
[SPEAKER_00]: when to go from vegetative growth or what
we call veg to reproductive growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: typically this is 18 and up to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours doesn't hurt the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be used quite as efficiently,
but you want a long photo period till you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a big plant and then you go into
reproductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that point, it's about, not 12
weeks, it's about eight weeks till
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought a couple of plants in here to
show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some that we're doing research
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a young plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets this big and depends on again on
the light level, but it could get this big
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks depending on what you start
from, but after you start from a rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we gave this plant 12 hours right now,
it would start to flower and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: never get very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have a fine yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just never get very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is keep it on 18 hour long
days and boom, now it gets big and now if
[SPEAKER_00]: we give it short days at this point,
we're going to have a lot of yield on one
[SPEAKER_00]: single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point here is gauge when to switch to
short days, to short 12 hour days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your plant's big enough to fill
the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you switch too early, you'll reduce
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you switch too late, the plant just
gets too enormous, bigger than you can
[SPEAKER_00]: handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plants increase in size about 30%
after switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one, maybe even double in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one might get this big when it's
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one would be enormous when it
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of choices for light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the intensity high, you absolutely
have to measure it so you know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already talked about all the blue
labels in the foliar environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you do not have an optimal root
zone environment, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow leaves, discolored leaves,
purple leaves, and that's why I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus a bit on the root zone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature in the root zone, about the
same as the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really 26 to 30 degrees C for
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen, nutrients, and water all have to
be optimal, particularly if we're driving
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go over here and I'll show you
the media that we use in the research lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some media components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people sell media for cannabis and
lots of people claim they have a special
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make our own from simple ingredients
and we have done 30 years of study on
[SPEAKER_00]: media components now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the media we use here in the
research laboratory and I'm going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: it up here and then I'll talk about
options for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, we'll put that in brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 50% peat, 50% vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most people know what peat
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody knows what vermiculite looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to those, but these are the
primary ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same, you can buy this at any hardware
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: In North America, it almost always comes
from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great media.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United Kingdom, they're really
trying to crack down on minimal use of
[SPEAKER_00]: peat and they've gone to many other
things, but in North America, growers
[SPEAKER_00]: typically start with peat in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some substitutes for peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are ground up wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a product called hydrofiber,
which is a shredded wood product and this
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used as a substitute for peat or as
an additive to peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put this on a slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was and still is sometimes widely
used for building insulation, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: mica that's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not widely used by commercial growers
of ornamental plants because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to use it years ago,
but as it became expensive, they switched
[SPEAKER_00]: to perlite, which is also widely available
in stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use perlite, but peat is a
little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're pushing plants for optimal
yields, we like to use peat and perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put vermiculite or perlite or
shredded wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand name that's widely available is
called hydrofiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of research on that in
this lab and it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, peat is the base and we've got
a lot of additives to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention, it's not a tray,
coconut coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strange name that spells coconut,
C-O-I-R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people pronounce it core,
some people pronounce it coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shredded coconuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This used to have a lot of problems 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of research on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The companies that make it have really
done a good job cleaning it up and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is much higher than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut coir is a fine additive for a
media as well, but we use peat and
[SPEAKER_00]: vermiculite because we want the absolute
premium media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermiculite has exceptionally good water
holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has exceptionally good cation exchange
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means ability to hold nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides, this is huge for cannabis,
S-I-L-I-Z-A, silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those little trichomes in cannabis are
full of silica on the leaves and more than
[SPEAKER_00]: other crops, cannabis benefits from
silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use vermiculite, you automatically
get lots of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other products don't have any
silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use one of these other products,
you should find an additive of silica and
[SPEAKER_00]: add it to the media or just use
vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several sources of silica products
to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about what we add to this
media here in our research lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the result of lots of
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat comes pretty acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of peat is about, it depends on the
peat, but I'm going to put 3.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty acid peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another benefit of vermiculite is it's
alkaline and you mix them together and
[SPEAKER_00]: this automatically, plus V-E-R-M
vermiculite, this goes to about 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still acid, but it's a lot better
than straight peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help get this in the optimal range,
we add, it's hard to see this,
[SPEAKER_00]: lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: East of the Mississippi, it's added to
fields all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, we add dolomitic lime,
which gives us some magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running out of room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus lime and I'm going to put,
dolomitic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dolomitic is a unique kind of lime that
has both calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add that, I get a look at this to make
sure I got my notes right, at 40 grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know this is mixed units,
metric and feet, but grams is easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought in my house hold scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't own one of these,
buy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to measure the weight of your
fertilizer on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little jar, one that I brought
from home of the blue powder fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weigh everything out on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 grams of lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brings the pH up to about 5.5 and
that's near optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds calcium and magnesium to the mix
and just mix it in into the media as you
[SPEAKER_00]: make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one other thing we add.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running out of room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it down here.
Gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gypsum is a common agricultural product
and it is calcium sulfate, CASO4,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This adds additional calcium, which is
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many places have inadequate calcium in the
tap water and it adds sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Utah we have low sulfur in our
water, so we put gypsum into the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can buy this in many places and
we use a pelletized gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that to the media and it's really slow
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a period of many months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need nearly as much gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 grams per cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be off 10% and it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can visualize a cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we wanted to do this all metric,
a cubic foot is 28.3 liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per cubic foot and now you can convert to
all metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one we like the best for an absolute
premium media is peat vermiculite with 40
[SPEAKER_00]: grams per cubic foot of lime and 10 grams
per cubic foot of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put the container down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these containers over here
that we use to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our container with our media in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep this pretty fluffy to get plenty
of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be sure you have enough oxygen,
you can buy an oxygen sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments sells an oxygen sensor
to put in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps you make sure you got plenty of
oxygen in your growth media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This media is so fluffy that it's hard to
over water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water will drain out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure you have a tray under
this because we're going to want to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the nutrient solution through
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's put in red nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put nutrients in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we use for nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many companies sell special nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tested many things over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach a class in principles of plant
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses this big heavy textbook,
mineral nutrition of higher plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've analyzed nutrients a lot and we've
done many tests here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found we use the same fertilizer
that we use for all of our other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat plants, corn plants, tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can recommend a general fertilizer that
works well for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizers come with three numbers,
N and P and K.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one we use is 20-10-20.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has less phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants need less phosphorus than nitrogen
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ratio gives us ample nutrients
provided we're slightly over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it really means is about 10% of the
water comes out the bottom and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: catch it and put it on your lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still fine fertilizer but when this
fertilizer is running through it helps to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that there's plenty of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to do this with no leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets trickier.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of this do we put in to the mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another instrument that you really
benefit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an electrical conductivity meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular one is sold by Hanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use Hanna instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use these a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more salt in the water, the higher the
electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell if your nutrient solution is
optimal by measuring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me do a little demo for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made two beakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put them right in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I want to put these on a piece of
white paper because we're going to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: little demo.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the difference in color?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tap water and this is our nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a blue dye in it so you can tell
when it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be just perceptible,
very light blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put this in tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what part of the country,
what part of the world you live in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but tap water is about 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: The units on this are millisiemens per
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The units are a little bit messy in this
because different meters have different
[SPEAKER_00]: units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look what happens with the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very dilute fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stir it a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see it on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.27.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 1.27.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put about 1.3 nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason this is important is you can
measure the electrical conductivity of
[SPEAKER_00]: this water that you collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this water is between one and one and a
half, you know your plants are doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't water enough, this gets too
high and they have too many nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's a big plant, it could be too
low too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put 1.3 in the top and water enough so
this is about 1.3 coming out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you measure that with an electrical
conductivity meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the fertilizer ratio to get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running out of room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to calculate it because
I can't remember the number off the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 20% in and we're going to want to
get about 120 ppm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the optimum level of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 ppm is 120 milligrams of N per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A part per million is exactly the same as
a milligram per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do this, you're going to end up
with an honorary degree in horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn to do this math.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizer is only 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 0.2 grams of N per one gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call this blue because it's
the blue fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 over 0.2 is 600 milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this times five.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 milligrams per liter equals 6 halban
120 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 0.6 grams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is grams of blue fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the optimum rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did this study over there with EC,
I put in 0.6 grams per liter of blue
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to know how to derive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just write down that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instructions come with that on the
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you briefly the vast array of
fertilizers that commercial growers use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know everybody looks this stuff up
on the internet, but I grew up in a time
[SPEAKER_00]: before the internet, so I still use paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the charts with all the
fertilizers used.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called Jack's fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Peter's fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all specialty fertilizers for
specialty applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my knowledge, these guys aren't
marketing a special cannabis fertilizer at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment, but if they did, they should
be selling 2010-20 because after a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, this is what we've gone to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are sold by many companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter's fertilizer is a famous brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's is essentially the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available in stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy these in stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in small packets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy them in 25-pound bags, a whole
pallet load of them because we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ratio of fertilizer applied at
this concentration to get, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to buy an EC meter to make sure you
didn't make a math error, to get about 1.2
[SPEAKER_00]: to 1.3 of your EC in a very slight blue
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a while, you get so good you can
tell the EC from looking at the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to fertilize daily,
it is possible to put in a slow-release
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a product called Nutricot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put these, and these come in
various release rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as precise as watering each
day with fertilizer like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for some kinds of studies,
if there's reasons you can't do a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: feed, or a straight hydroponics,
you can put slow-release fertilizer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to learn how often you have to
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant gets big, let's go back to
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the light, the more you have to
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant, at a thousand micromoles per
meter squared per second, we could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably water it once every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you think we need to water
this plant, if there's a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big plant in a small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you really benefit from having
some kind of automated system or a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people go to quite a large
container, so they only have to water once
[SPEAKER_00]: a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on how big the plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to develop the skill of
lifting the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pot feels heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's full of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it runs out of water, it'll feel
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tremendous skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep lifting your pots and gauge how much
water is in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many products you can poke in here
to get water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, it all comes back to
calibrating yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do much better by lifting the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered all of these cardinal
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: For plants, nutrients and media are big,
and light is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get these correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do temperature and humidity in
your box.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have plenty of wind, you're going
to be fine with ambient CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to conclude on one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of cannabis gets yellow leaves,
purple leaves, discolored leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: burned leaf edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our research here, most of the time,
that's from too much fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: People panic and they think they don't
have enough, but it's often from too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why that EC meter is so
important, and why flushing it like this
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps it from being either deficient or
toxic because you're flushing the pot a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit each time you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get these parameters right,
your plants look just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be healthy, green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at high light, you can push them hard
and get high growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll join you again on another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already got two questions from the
audience that I want to make really clear
[SPEAKER_00]: in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, water with nutrient solution
every time you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't dip and tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very dilute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made to be watered every so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single time, no matter if you water once
every three days, three times a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: always water with nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's thing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing two, color of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge question, and many people
have strong opinions about colors of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, and we've done a lot of studies on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what it comes down to for
homeowners.
[SPEAKER_00]: White.
[SPEAKER_00]: W-H-I-T-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: White light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I recommend that is you can see
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could diagnose subtle differences in
color of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can diagnose tiny insects in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this old Chinese saying,
the best fertilizer is the footsteps of
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the plants are in white light,
you're going to want to look at them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple lights are slightly more efficient,
but white lights have come a long ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can be white plus red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good, but something that makes the
plants look green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
