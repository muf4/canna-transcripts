[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, Professor of Crop
Physiology here at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thrilled today to be announcing the
fall 2022 edition of our well-known course
[SPEAKER_00]: in medical cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with 54 lectures in the first
edition, and we're going to build on that
[SPEAKER_00]: in this new edition with about 40
additional lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this course, that's going to mean
lectures on plant breeding, expanded
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and diseases, cannabinoid
extraction, medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thrilled to bring you this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joined in this effort by Dr. Royal
Hines, a long-term colleague, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitchell Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the primary instructors,
and we're joined by several other people
[SPEAKER_00]: helping us in specialty areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me very quickly show you what we're
going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine cardinal parameters form the basis of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four in the root zone, five in the shoot
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We especially focus on nutrients,
water, light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the light goes up, the water goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything interacts with everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is complex but exciting in its
complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not only going to give you lectures
in the principles and the theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to take you to our greenhouses
and our growth chambers and show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: research we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actively conducting research on
cannabis cultivation, and as we make new
[SPEAKER_00]: discoveries, we're going to share them
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show you how we collect the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 44 growth chambers here at
Utah State University to do this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the course, you can take an
exam, and on successful completion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: exam, you'll get a certificate of
completion signed by all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a great thing for students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might add that the tuition money that
you pay goes to support graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't pay my salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't pay for anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just supports our graduate education in
our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to have you in the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
