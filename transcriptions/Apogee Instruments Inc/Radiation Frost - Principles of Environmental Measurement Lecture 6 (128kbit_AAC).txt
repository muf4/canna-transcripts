[SPEAKER_00]: This follows up nicely with net radiation
because we just talked about the fluxes at
[SPEAKER_00]: night and Mark said okay what happens at
night?
[SPEAKER_00]: The incoming is zero and if the sky is
colder than the ground there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous flux of radiation to the cold
night sky and the surface can get very
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's underappreciated how cold surfaces
can actually get at night when the sky is
[SPEAKER_00]: clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the examples of the power of this
is if you build an insulated box,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially a tall box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to draw this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we build, let's say it's a circular
cylinder like this and it's well insulated
[SPEAKER_00]: so we fill this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is open on the top but it's full of
insulation and now we put at the bottom a
[SPEAKER_00]: dish of water and we paint this black to
have a high emissivity and it's just open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take this cylinder and we put it
outside in the summer on a clear night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a PhD comprehensive exam question
I like to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens to the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have a little blue for the water,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And shallow dish of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air temperature out here, let's say
it's, doesn't matter, let's say it's 30
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty warm night but it's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens to the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it change temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it get hotter or colder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's radiating to the clear night sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went outside with those things and the
sky temperature is minus 30 or some cold
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The incoming radiation is real tiny
because it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't warm up by conduction and
convection because we've insulated this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and if the wind is blowing it'll
keep it warm but if it's a calm night and
[SPEAKER_00]: it sits there not so this is such I've
read this in some physics book a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: ago and so I built this in my backyard and
got it all instrumented and put
[SPEAKER_00]: thermocouples in here and sat out there at
night and measured this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets colder and colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's continuously radiating to the sky and
even when the air temperature is 30
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees the water freezes inside this
column because it's coming to equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: with the sky, a super cold temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't just a physics experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can use this in the tropics to keep
food cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can radiate to the sky at night and
then in the daytime you just cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cool it down at night and no
electricity just the physics of radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you a sense of the power of
long wave radiation at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what happens to a surface,
a leaf of a plant or a surface at night
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cloudy not much happens because
the clouds are low and they're similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: ground temperature but if it's clear they
cool off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you run models because if you buy a
net radiometer and you measure it and you
[SPEAKER_00]: model it and we see conditions where it's
easily five degrees C below air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's cases when it's been 10
degrees C below air temperature at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that led us to make this sensor a
radiation frost sensor which is a way
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper version than having to buy a net
radiometer and run all these models anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: to predict surface temperatures at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's black so it has a high
emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar like 0.96.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to leaf surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black disc and you put it outside and we
measure then the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of that disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a tiny thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you some data in a minute but
you can see how this simulates a leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature or there's another sensor here
in a tiny little thermistor, a bud of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called when a surface freezes
and the air temperature never got below
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing that's called a radiation frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a huge deal worldwide for
commercial fruit producers where their
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive flowers are coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little buds in the spring coming out on
that plant and if those get below freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: they can lose millions of dollars in
commercial yield because their flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it's such a big deal they start
wind machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start sprinkle irrigation to freeze
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do all kinds of things to protect
their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they need to know exactly when to
start this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called this radiation frost sensor or
also a nighttime surface temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor and it measures these physical
principles of radiation transmission and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my next slide we don't have one of
these here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have picked some even worse data
than this but this is a typical data for a
[SPEAKER_00]: night in our spring in the northern
hemisphere where this is that sensor and
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperatures are all coming down
together but it's a clear night hours from
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting close to midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at that big leaf sensor cooling
off and a little bit and when it's calm
[SPEAKER_00]: wind this is wind speed it really starts
to diverge a lot because the wind will
[SPEAKER_00]: warm it back up when it gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's not a lot of wind it just
keeps getting colder and right in here
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere if you are only measuring air
temperature you wouldn't be worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: a frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the air temperature is plus three
degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the leaves are already starting to
freeze and it gets bigger and bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: finally four hours after midnight the air
finally gets below freezing but the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has been below freezing for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So frost is the big economic thing for
freezing of sensitive buds but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you an indication of nighttime
surface temperatures and we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring those in the day and predicting
water loss and at night it's more of
[SPEAKER_00]: models and predicting rate of development
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we understand the night temperature
then we can predict rate of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty simple sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an expensive sensor and it's been
particularly useful to commercial tree
[SPEAKER_00]: crop producers to tell when to turn on
their fans to protect their crop at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty simple story once you
understand the concept of net radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
