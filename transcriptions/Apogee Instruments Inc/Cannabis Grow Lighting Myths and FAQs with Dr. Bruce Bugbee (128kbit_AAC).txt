[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments and also professor of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video today we're going to talk
about the basics of lighting as it applies
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is profoundly misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The database is filled with a lot of myths
that we have studied or over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're calling this Cannabis 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first part of the series is just
focused on lighting, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: key parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee has spent decades refining
instruments to quantify light,
[SPEAKER_00]: the types of light, the intensities of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, in my experience, those instruments
are underutilized to help refine the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of it is just because people
don't know how to interpret the data and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a company, Apogee Instruments' motto
is, we help people make measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is our ongoing education
to help people interpret the data that
[SPEAKER_00]: they get, make sure the measurements are
high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this video is about with a
focus on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not focused on all the other crops
like lettuce that's grown under electric
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah State University is one of the few
agricultural universities that now has a
[SPEAKER_00]: license to study hemp at the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say cannabis, I mean both hemp
and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our license isn't for marijuana,
it's only for hemp, but the studies apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to both types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about cannabis in
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty hard to under emphasize the
importance of light when growing a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this next slide, which I've used many
times in many talks, really focuses on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the nine cardinal parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to take a university class,
you would be reviewing each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four of the parameters are in the foliar
environment, temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: air velocity or wind, and carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four are in the root zone environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have temperature down there,
amount of water, nutrients, and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We teach whole classes on each one of
these parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may do a series on cannabis on each
one of these parameters, but today we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to focus on the one that is
absolutely critical, and that's light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put this right at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can get this back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's go to pen tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light, and let's see if we can get that
yellow to emphasize the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is coming in from all directions on
this plant, and it drives the optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you turn the light up, you have to give
the plants more water because it drives
[SPEAKER_00]: the flux of water through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I should have drawn this in yellow
or in blue for water flux through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn the light up, you need more
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more oxygen in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, we get questions from people
saying, my light must be too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are turning yellow or purple or
some color.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it really is, is an imbalance between
the amount of light and the optimum levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a race car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a race car that can go
incredibly fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything is optimal, you can give
cannabis exceptionally high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, and I'm going to go into how we
measure that and quantify it, if all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other parameters are also optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give it more light and you don't
have the right nutrient balance or the
[SPEAKER_00]: right water, or you don't have elevated
CO2, you're going to have problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not fundamentally caused by the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caused by inadequate levels of the
other parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like a race car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying you got a giant engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're out at the Utah Bonneville salt
flats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going 700 miles an hour,
and the tires blow on the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say, ah, dang it, the engine was
too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the engine wasn't too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have the right tires for that
big of an engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the analogy of how important it is
to get the lighting right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with how we even measure
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people say, how much light do I
need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll say, oh, keep your plants
about 30 centimeters, about a foot away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you how bad that is as a
measurement of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do this, we have set up
here in the Apigee studios, two lights of
[SPEAKER_00]: different wattages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do a demonstration now to
show you how important that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to step over here and plug the
light in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheel is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's two lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them right in the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different wattages of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could turn them toward the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be incredibly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've set this up so we can measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do this right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure the intensity of the light
from these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the number right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into what this means in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's 27 micromoles of photons right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the light from the studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put this over here, seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, seven is plenty of light for humans
to work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A well-lit office has seven micromoles
that is way too low to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell these are a little brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we said it's seven here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How bright is it over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it might be 50 over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go under this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's see if we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see this green?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hold this right here about a
foot away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the number we're getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: A well-lit office is seven to ten,
and this is 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little brighter, but it doesn't
look 20 or 30 times as bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much, much brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a foot away.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if that was our measure for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, here's another light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go a foot away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we put it under this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to get it centered.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on exactly how far away,
but we're approaching 3,000 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go a hair closer, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,000 micromoles under this light,
and we go under this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're down around 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is almost an order of magnitude more
photons under one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is the input wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a low input wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high input wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not color of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's input wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can see that just saying put
your plants some distance away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights is a very inadequate way to
precisely grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our eyes are one of the worst meters for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pupils contract to reduce the amount
of light getting to our retina in bright
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a terrible light meter in terms of
intuitive estimating of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need an instrument to measure
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a demo of the fact that you can't
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, remember that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take 300 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much cannabis could we grow with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop here and take these out
of the way so we can interpret the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're back with a white screen that we
can take a look at what we just measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, let's draw what we call a
light response curve for plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll draw a light response curve for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As students in my classes know over the
years, I draw a lot of XY plots to take an
[SPEAKER_00]: input variable here and look at response.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to put over here is PN.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stands for net photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, we're going to put PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we just measured with that
apogee meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph starts at zero here and zero
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was introduction to plant science
and we ask this question, everyone would
[SPEAKER_00]: say, well, of course, light or photon flux
drives photosynthesis, so that curve is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was plant science 101,
we would count that as a correct answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's a more advanced class,
we know that the higher the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: this doesn't keep going up forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can't keep using all those photons,
so a more correct answer looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can even erase this top incorrect
answer and go back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a more correct answer because it
levels off at high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now notice I didn't put any tick marks on
here yet because we just measured 300
[SPEAKER_00]: micro moles and even almost 3,000 out of
that other light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one more thing that makes this
curve even more accurate and I'll put that
[SPEAKER_00]: in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a plant and put it in the
dark, it gradually respires and dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't keep it in the dark for weeks or
months, so this line doesn't go through
[SPEAKER_00]: zero right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the dark, we get a negative number.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is shrinking, it's dying,
and we turn on the lights and it goes like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some point right here where
there's just enough light to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, by the way, is called the light
compensation point when there's enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light to get it to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's put some tick marks on this
axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis, let's make this go to 60
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, the units for this are micro
moles per meter squared of leaf per second
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how fast it's fixing carbon and
dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's put some tick marks on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go up to here, what's full sunlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we went outside in the summer at noon,
what would we get for high light?
[SPEAKER_00]: We would get 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an important reference point,
2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: These units are micro moles of photons per
meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This over here could be just yield of the
plants, but these are the units that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring to get the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if that's 2,000, 1,000 is right here
and 500 is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I drew this graph, wow,
we have to have 400 micro moles just to
[SPEAKER_00]: get above zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this only happens in a dense crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can erase this,
erase these lines, and I'm going to draw
[SPEAKER_00]: two lines on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fill this back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our green.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go to blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we did these measurements for lettuce,
lettuce is a widely grown crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: very widely studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also a low light plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce grows fine in much lower light
than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we draw a curve for lettuce,
first of all it starts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes up and at about 500, lettuce is
done and it might even go down out here of
[SPEAKER_00]: really high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what if we put cannabis on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is life in the fast lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow cannabis much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put cannabis in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it doesn't really have a low
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a high respiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis looks something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps going up until 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is a very high light crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it a lot of light,
but you've got to have all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure you need elevated CO2 for
cannabis and ample water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually automated watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a balanced nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a topic of a whole other talk,
but our data don't indicate cannabis needs
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual nutrients, but it needs a balanced
nutrients and not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually there's toxicities from too much
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have this high light and the
water's going through the plant that fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be careful not to have too
much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, look at cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn is like this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn is a very high light field crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get a meter to measure this and if
the leaves are green, we're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: photons efficiently and we have high
photosynthetic rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a closer look at this unit down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is generally a widely used unit,
but it's not universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this and I can do
that on a next screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go back to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple acronyms are used to measure
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common one is PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The P always stands for photosynthetically
active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to a slightly smaller line size.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty fat line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a generic term for all
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could mean watts per meter squared
and that's confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a more rigorous term is PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stands for photosynthetic photon flux
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this always means, that number from
the previous one, moles of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think of photons as like tiny
little marbles falling out of the sky to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be colored marbles, but they're
all marbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're measuring this flux of photons
coming into the plant per meter squared,
[SPEAKER_00]: per unit area of surface area,
per unit time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always use per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the unit for PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a big number, a mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really a micromole,
10 to the minus 6 moles per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this number ranges, and we just showed
that in the other slide, 0 up to 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember those lights we measured?
[SPEAKER_00]: One was 300, one was over 3000 because it
was a high wattage light and we're real
[SPEAKER_00]: close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll come back to this later,
but PPFD is the number that we're after
[SPEAKER_00]: here for light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go to another screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take our same screen here
and we had PPFD 0, let's go all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very bright light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rarely get this high of light under
electric lights, but we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here we're just going to put
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not photosynthesis anymore because
photosynthesis leads to yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much light is necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really key about this is not the
instantaneous light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put our graph on here
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact shape varies with different
cultivars, but it doesn't vary very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out it's not exactly the PPFD,
it is the DLI, Daily Light Integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as this implies, an integral means we
add up all of the photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is per second and every second we
accumulate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if this was rainfall?
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD would tell us the rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast is it raining per second?
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually what we want to know is how
much did it rain yesterday, the total
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of rain, and that's the Daily Light
Integral called DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you how to convert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see this you'll know it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put 1000 in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to convert from PPFD to DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1000 micromoles per meter squared per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to know per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's 3600 seconds per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 3.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now notice this is 1000 and that's 3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you multiply these together,
the 1000s cancel and this is 3.6 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: No micro anymore because we just
multiplied two big numbers together.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.6 moles per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, when it's in the flowering
stage, we would typically give it 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we multiply these two together,
3.6 and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this because I've done it so many
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes out to be 43.2 moles per meter
squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that number right there, this is so
important, we'll put it in red,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a 1000 micromoles per second
continuously for 12 hours, you get 43 a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis responds to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our studies, we can push them even
higher than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never gone to 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've gone close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone over to 1800, up to where we've
gotten this number close to 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside, in the summer, under full
sunlight, on sunny days, DLI can get to 60
[SPEAKER_00]: moles per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an incredible DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis grows outside in full sunlight
and it loves it at the response to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can run the DLI up extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how low can you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here'd be 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line still goes up, but it's curving
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2000 doesn't give us twice the yield of
1000, but it's still higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we keep raising this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here'd be 500 right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, you've got to know this
input to have reproducible studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get it, you need to measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a second to look at,
review some of the instruments that Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are a little sensor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quantum sensor is blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we used a minute ago to
measure these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one plugs right in to a laptop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a USB cable and you can plug right
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to remember to take the cap off of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optics here are really rugged,
but we still ship them with the cap to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug this right into a laptop,
just like I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see the numbers on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something more portable,
here is a handheld meter with a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These also come with the sensor right in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the options that's big and
catching on fast is Bluetooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Bluetooth module.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures and stores the data and then
you just transmit this data right to your
[SPEAKER_00]: cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a powerful option.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of graphics associated with
this for measuring the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them go to this sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you jump up, another level,
this gold cube is a spectroradiometer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gives you all the ratios of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these other instruments are down in a
few hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This instrument is over $2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much more sophisticated,
but this is what researchers use to get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything exactly right in all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get questions all the time on issues
relating to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just addressed one of them, daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can push daily light integral easily to
30, to 40, to 50, and the yield keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: going up if everything's optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of how much light it tolerates,
this is true even for young seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our research projects right now is
to push the rooting of cuttings of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with very high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years and years we'd keep plants in
really low light with cuttings because
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have any roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding if we can keep them watered,
we can even push a cutting with very high
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly a young plant, you can push
them hard with high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as long as the other inputs are not
limiting growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about darkness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to another screen, another topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put this one in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to do hours per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different graph, hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's noon, here's midnight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, here's PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no evidence that suddenly turning
on the light shocks the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get out of bed and go right to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to ramp up slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say we turn on the lights at 6 a
.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run them high until 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a 16 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we're in flowering phase,
let's go back to red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're in flowering phase, we might run
them from 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a 12-hour photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really just two photo periods
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 16 and even an 18-hour photo period for
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, some of our data indicates
this could even be 24 hours for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get the plants growing with a high
DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we want them to flower,
we switch to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This number right here is darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: How dark does it have to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we're actively studying
right now in my laboratory at the
[SPEAKER_00]: university.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some literature reports that
indicate that cannabis is exquisitely
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive to trace amounts of light
pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of light will cause
problems with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a wealth of literature on
poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're one of our most sensitive crops to
light pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without excellent darkness, those top
leaves of cannabis don't turn red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called bracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't turn red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is cannabis more sensitive than
poinsettias?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet, but we know it needs to
be very dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this reagent grade darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like somebody's sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are bothered by a tiny light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep and other people doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think cannabis is quite sensitive
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this reason, Apogee has made an
extended range quantum sensor that's
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated to rigorously measure light
pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember we were doing micromoles per
meter squared per second and we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers in the hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular sensor can measure 0.01
micromoles per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a unique meter that can detect trace
amounts of light and it helps you
[SPEAKER_00]: determine whether it's absolutely dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an extended range sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It even picks up the photons from security
cameras, which there's possibilities for
[SPEAKER_00]: those to affect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a topic for another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extended range quantum sensor for light
pollution studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is getting down around full moonlight
and we know that full moonlight doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: affect cannabis or any other plants,
but it might not take much more of that to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cultivars differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people say, gee this happened in one
and this is something else happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an emerging number of different
cultivars for cannabis and as you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you're watching this video,
I won't write them up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all cannabis sativa and underneath
that we have indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cannabis sativa sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our studies at the university indicate
there's definitely differences in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf width, leaf size, but in terms of
response to all these parameters I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, there's not a significant
difference between the types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can push both types of cannabis with
high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both love high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both evolved out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences can be in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be in photoperiod sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cultivars of cannabis we think can
take 13 hours of light over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might be able to take 14,
but in terms of pushing them with high
[SPEAKER_00]: light, they're all similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about some of the other
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other questions we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is what about light quality
and the synthesis of what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's THC, CBD, CBN, CBG, all the
different cannabinoid compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in another class of compounds there's
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about light quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a whole other talk and I have
given other talks on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in other videos on the Apogee
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in this,
look for other videos on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the take-home message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have evidence that changing the
colors of light makes a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference on cannabinoid synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an amazing statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light quality does not have a huge effect
on the ratios of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in spite of many people claiming
it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our data in general don't support that
there's big effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say there was none.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't see big effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still actively studying that and
stay tuned because we're looking at all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of different ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me conclude on one part of light
that is enormously important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go to a new screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to draw those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to draw the axes in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 400 to 700 and this is the
wavelength of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to get an honorary degree
in cannabis science, you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: memorize these two numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use lambda to express this and the unit
here is nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is colors of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you would use this
spectroradiometer to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people know, but let's review
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here, if we do 500 and 600,
this area right here, 4 to 500,
[SPEAKER_00]: is blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks blue to the human eye and we call
that range blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go to 5 to 600 and that range is
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go to 6 to 7 and that range is red.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many of you this is review,
but it's important to have the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic radiation stops right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our historic and classic definition of
this is 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a photon at 701, we don't count
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's at 399, we don't count it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't chop off like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known that for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a useful approximation of
photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we have LEDs, that we can
fine-tune all these wavelengths,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are re-examining what we have used for
half a century.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two specific wavelengths that are
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm still on red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get that up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is out here to 750 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our eyes have trouble seeing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a dull glow of a red burner
on a stove of an electric burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't really read a book by this,
but it has powerful effects on plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: it adds 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our data indicate that these photons cause
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly cause changes in plant
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make plants branch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually make them taller with more
far-red, but these photons are critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that, let's talk about
the other end down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These photons, especially 350,
300 nanometers, this of course is all
[SPEAKER_00]: ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our eyes don't see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, electric lights,
we try to get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not useful for human lighting,
but they have powerful effects on plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially this region at 350 right here
of UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our data indicate these photons cause
photosynthesis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see an emerging
change in the definition of photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation maybe from 350 to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple laboratories are studying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, Apogee has come out with
what we call an extended range quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a sensor that measures everything
from 350 way out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's security cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a big peak out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's centered around 830 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extended range picks up all these
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some kinds of lights, these photons
are critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the classic quantum sensor
doesn't include them, the Apogee extended
[SPEAKER_00]: range quantum sensor does include them.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV photons have the potential to reduce
disease in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the potential to trigger
cannabinoid synthesis in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting a lot of energy into
studying the potential use of UV photons
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of questions about optimum
ratios of colors for both growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis and for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me fall back on the one principle here
that has guided us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the percent blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this in a different screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, before we had LEDs,
people said you want to do metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: for veg before they became reproductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would typically be giving maybe even
an 18-hour photo period during that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the prevailing wisdom was to switch
to high pressure sodium during the
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people said, oh god, that's all a
myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halide has 30% blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is having trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the blue photons, the more
compact the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halide was very effective at making
nice compact plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium, on the other hand,
only has about 4% blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight has about 30% blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They switched to high pressure sodium
because it's a much more efficient light
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can get bright intensity,
but it had low blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue didn't matter so much during
flowering because the flowers kept the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants short.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a reason to go with high blue
light during veg and then a very efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: light during flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ratio of blue photons for plant
height and then the efficiency of a light
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we like to see are very efficient
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratios of colors are less critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do like to see lights with enough green
photons so you can diagnose plant
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those green photons usually come from
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to look for microscopic
insects, subtle disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be able to see the plants to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, it's just the efficiency of
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search for Design Light Consortium
on the internet, the acronym is DLC,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is an independent company that has
now been listing lights from many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many manufacturers and their test results
from independent test laboratories for the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit for light efficiency is
micromoles of photons out per joule of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really efficient lights, LEDs are now
getting up to 2.5 micromoles per joule and
[SPEAKER_00]: even higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're incredibly efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years ago, we were half of that
efficiency for lights, but it's critical
[SPEAKER_00]: to get an efficient light and a broad
spectrum light so you can get enough
[SPEAKER_00]: colors to see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
See you next time.
Bye-bye.
Thanks for listening.
Thanks for listening.
