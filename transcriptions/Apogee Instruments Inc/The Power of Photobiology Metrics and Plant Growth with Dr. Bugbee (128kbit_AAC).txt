[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, President of Apogee
Instruments and Professor of Crop
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I want to talk about our latest
spectroradiometer, the features it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you for plant photobiology and on the
screen itself of the instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other videos that are like owner's
manuals of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus on interpreting the
data from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This instrument has got a tiny screen
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make a measurement like this and
instantaneously or within seconds,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gives you the calculated values in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are five screens in this and I'm
going to go through each of them and what
[SPEAKER_00]: the values represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the instrument big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a model MS-100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minutes ago, I walked outside and took a
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In sunlight, that sunlight's a wonderful
reference spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's close to solar noon here in Logan,
Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at what these values
look like with sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sunlight spectra and this shows
up immediately in the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was an LED, we'd get a spike of
blue and fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an immediate spectral trace of the
light you're looking at, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately, you can interpret a lot of
stuff just from this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No downloading of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click the shutter speed in the
instrument and collect this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot we can do with this screen
and let me put some units on this right
[SPEAKER_00]: away if you're less familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, this tells you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a color in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put this in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four tick marks in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with the sunlight
spectra, this is UV, this part right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this instrument detects down to 350
nanometers, which is most of the photons
[SPEAKER_00]: by the majority of the photons even from
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the first tick mark is 400 nanometers
and 500 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600, 700, and then out here is 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the subsequent screens tell us the
number of photons in each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: categories, but first of all, four to 500
is B for blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five to six is G for green photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six to seven is red for red photons and
then this critically important part out
[SPEAKER_00]: here, 700 to 750 is FR, far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UV, put that on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five categories of
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it downloads the spectra so you can
fine tune this as much as you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for quick analysis, the fractions of
photons in each of these categories are
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This axis is of course photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an F and it's micromoles of photons
per meter squared of area per second and
[SPEAKER_00]: now because this is all these little tiny
bins, it's per second per nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a spectroradiometer gives you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you download the spectra to a laptop
or to a cell phone, it gives you more data
[SPEAKER_00]: than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the screen it shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the opening screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you got the correct spectra in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save the spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is screen number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go to screen number two and
we're starting to parse out these ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD, as we've talked about in previous
videos, is PFD is the photon flux density
[SPEAKER_00]: and P is the photosynthetic photon flux
density and this means 400 to 700
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers and this is the classic
definition of photon flux density that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've used for over 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight, we always say, goes up to 2000
micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The units over here for these are all
micromoles per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this serves with this metric as a
regular quantum sensor, a high-resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum sensor and we always say sunlight
goes to 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now in Utah it was 1948.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there was slightly overcast or it's
not exactly solar noon, but it's close to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now E, this lowercase E, stands for
extended photosynthetic photon flux
[SPEAKER_00]: density and what this means is 400 to 750,
that's a seven, nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same units here, but it adds the far-red
photons to this that, based on lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: research, have photosynthetic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives us both numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look, 1923, this is adding some
far-red photons in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference would be the far-red
photons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are actually shown on another
screen, but this ought to be slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you measured this under red and blue
LEDs, there's virtually no far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers would be almost the same,
but if you measure under white LEDs,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a tail, so the ePPFD is almost
always a little bit higher and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher if you're measuring lights
that have a lot of far-red photons in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered these in previous videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't write out the full acronym right
here, but now there's a third metric in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y, PFD, photon flux density, the same as
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Y stands for yield and this is a
metric we've had for 50 years and it does
[SPEAKER_00]: not weight all the photons equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A blue photon comes just as much as a
green and a red, they're all equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our definition of these,
but we know that particularly blue and
[SPEAKER_00]: green photons aren't absorbed as well by
photosynthetic pigments as red photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this metric weights the photons,
it weights the red photons more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue and more than the green and because
of that, this is always a number slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many researchers report all of these in
their papers to make sure you've got all
[SPEAKER_00]: the metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, Y, PFD is a more accurate
predictor of photosynthetic photons than
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD and we don't have it yet,
but in theory you can have an EY PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making that up just now because that
doesn't exist yet, but this is this
[SPEAKER_00]: weighted, so I'm gonna cross that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a weighted flux of photons and
it's always about 90% of these because it
[SPEAKER_00]: discounts blue photons for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, to round it out, T stands for
total photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how this number's higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is everything the instrument measures
and it's 380 to 780.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the edges of this, it counts the UV
photons in this, it counts all the far red
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, and it's a bigger number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these metrics is valuable in
photobiology depending on the study,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what you use, but the beauty
of this is you click the shutter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you take a measurement, and you have these
numbers immediately right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stored in memory, but you have
them right there to analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is screen two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have five screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screen three puts these photon fluxes in
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, UV is 380 to 400, so there's the
flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only 38, round this number to 39.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these units are micromoles,
again, per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sunlight, 39 micromoles of UV
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: B is for blue, 400 to 500, 500 for blue,
and you can see in sunlight, it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more green and even a little more red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That curve goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the green photons, here's the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we sum these up, we would get the
total photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just added these together,
we would get the PPFD, but this breaks it
[SPEAKER_00]: down into categories of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is screen three, and depending on
what you're doing, this is really useful
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to immediately see the number
of photons in each of these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screen four.
[SPEAKER_00]: This focuses on far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are such powerful photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four critical metrics for far-red
photons, and remember, the far-red is,
[SPEAKER_00]: where am I going to put that, is 700 to
750 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This edge, we can barely see it,
but it's very, very powerful for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the photon flux of far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this could be on the previous screen,
but there's four numbers on each screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there was 357.5 far-red photons in
sunlight right now when we made this
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: FRF stands for far-red fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is far-red photons over total
photons, PPFD, and in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's E, PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is a number that goes
from zero to one, the fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was pure far-red light, the
numerator and denominator would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it'd be one, this is very convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look for ratios that are zero to one in
all of our science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a fraction, it's 0.15.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was a percent, we'd have 15.5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty close to the typical far-red
fraction in sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real useful number because it gets
so intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there 5% far-red photons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there 20% far-red photons?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used this in manuscripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Kusum and I have a manuscript on the
importance of far-red fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming very widely used in
photobiology to describe the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPE is a different metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can leave this other one up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is for phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochrome photoequilibria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also called, I'll put this here,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's switch to yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also known as PSS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stands for phytochrome
photostationary state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochrome photoequilibria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a number that also goes from zero
to one depending on the amount of far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you a few slides to
explain that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 0.69, which means there's quite a
bit of far-red photons in sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this weights all the photons over the
entire spectrum for whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to stem elongation or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stem elongation is largely controlled by
phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a final metric on this screen,
IPPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stands for internal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is the predicted
phytochrome effects inside the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: not above the leaf, but inside the leaf,
internal to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new metric, IPPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our data indicate it more accurately
predicts stem elongation under a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: colors of light than the old metric,
which was PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we show both metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleagues have been putting both
metrics in their papers to predict things
[SPEAKER_00]: like leaf expansion and stem elongation,
but this predicts both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look, this is 69, and this one's only
39.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big difference in these two
metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd like to do is take a little
sidebar right now and show you some slides
[SPEAKER_00]: that I showed a few weeks ago at a big
NASA conference to explain the
[SPEAKER_00]: significance of these metrics for plant
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to those slides, and we'll
come back to this one right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is improved metrics for photo
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just slides from that talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of the phytochrome
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big organic molecule with a lot of
proteins in it, but it switches back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth between two forms depending on the
colors of light, mostly red and far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to think of this as nature's
light switch because it's either on or off
[SPEAKER_00]: telling the plants you're in the shade,
get tall, you're in the sun, stay short,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it just switches back and forth
between these two, and you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectroradiometer to calculate which form
it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's interesting because there's
thousands of these molecules in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant is integrating all of these
light switches to decide whether it should
[SPEAKER_00]: get tall or whether it should stay short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the significance of this simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: In shade, plants have a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can avoid shade and get tall,
or they can tolerate shade and grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a plant in sunlight over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's short with small leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can do with photo biology and
lights is trickle these plants into
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking they're in the shade so they get
more leaves, and that's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trick them to think they're in the
shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species get tall, and this is very
undesirable, but this is that curve we
[SPEAKER_00]: were just looking at for sunlight measured
under the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our classic 300 to 400,
500, 600, 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look what happens in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath the tree, all of these
wavelengths are filtered out, and this far
[SPEAKER_00]: red, better put that in a darker color,
this far red right here is transmitted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it flips that phytochrome molecule to
the on position, and it says, change
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, change shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they're in the shade or not,
we could trick them, but in nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're critical in shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the classic ratio of colors that
leads to this metric, phytochrome
[SPEAKER_00]: photoequilibria, and it's a ratio of far
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a ratio of far red over total
photons, and it heavily weights blue
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, and less of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known about this curve for about 60,
70 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In studies, I picked one here from 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a number gets higher, stems get
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this is not quite correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: PFR is response to the red photons,
not the far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this number gets higher, more red
light, plants get shorter, and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good predictor of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You measure it, and you know the potential
of your light source to make tall plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or to make leaves expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This worked great, but the phytochrome
molecule is not just on the surface of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inside the leaves, and here's these
blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep coming back to these same
wavelengths here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue photons are absorbed by chlorophyll
and other pigments, and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cross-section of a leaf,
top and bottom, blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green photons penetrate into the leaf,
and this is the transmission here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red photons don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far red really penetrate into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the phytochrome molecule
actually see?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sees the penetrating photons into the
leaf, so when we did tests on the old,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the old PPE right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this wonderfully predicts, this is a
linear relationship, stem elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did that test with different
ratios of colors in the background,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue, green, and red, the lines got all
mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predictive value of PPE was not very
good, so we have a problem with the PPE
[SPEAKER_00]: under LED lights where there's a mixture
of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the old curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, by the way, is done with Paul
Kasuma, a PhD student with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now an assistant professor at
Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the paper this came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the original PPE right here,
put that in yellow, with the weighting
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that we've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the screening of chlorophyll,
the classic screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: More green gets through, a lot more far
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take this times this, we get this
function, and this function is IPPE,
[SPEAKER_00]: which your new spectroradiometer measures,
calculates instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This heavily weights red, this heavily
weights far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well does this newer metric predict
stem elongation under a range of light
[SPEAKER_00]: sources?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's I.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, same curve I've been showing
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is PPE with colors, and this is IPPE,
the new metric with a big background of
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, and the lines converge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, coupled with other people's studies
now, indicates internal PPE is just an
[SPEAKER_00]: improved metric, more precise for
measuring phytochrome effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: considering what's called the spectral
distortion of the leaf, the filtering of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of slides to derive why IPPE
is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to the spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's PPE and IPPE one last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We show them both, the older metric and
the newer metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more sensitive to, as an under
range of zero to one, this is more
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers tend to be all very high,
0.7 to 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.9, whereas these numbers are 0.3 to 0.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is screen four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one final screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is screen five, and these are metrics
for human lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color rendering index, which most people
are aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a number of zero to 100, closer to
100, the better the light source renders
[SPEAKER_00]: colors for the human eye, the reds and the
greens and the blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, zero to 100, this is sunlight,
and that's the reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color rendering index,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an index, it usually means a
number of zero to one or zero to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight's a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's CFI?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the color fidelity index.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been called by some people TM30
for technical memo 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also called RG, but it's an index
zero to 100, so we call it the color
[SPEAKER_00]: fidelity index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, under sunlight, 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as good as it gets for color
rendering index.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under LEDs, this number gives bizarre
values.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives negative values.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CFI is a much improved newer index,
and people say, oh, the calculations are
[SPEAKER_00]: more complex for CFI.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, this is based on six reference
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on 99 reference colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells you something about how
superior it is, and people say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, the calculations are much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, well, that takes about five
microseconds to do those calculations in a
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This CFI is replacing CRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I would say it's largely replaced
it, but this has been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, let's see if we can erase these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give ourselves a little bit more room
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put this in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color-correlated temperature is a number
between about 2,000 and about 7,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on really the blueness versus
the orange-ness of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the higher the number, the more blue
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sunlight, so it's 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight is very blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was an incandescent light,
this number might be about 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the store and you buy LEDs,
and you can pick whether you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: simulate an old incandescent light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incandescent light is about 2,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a warm, orangish glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say you put warm colors in your
bathroom to make it look like you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool colors in the kitchen to be more like
sunlight in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives a number from 2,000 to 8,000,
depending on the blueness of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the old classic lux, which is the
weighted human eye response for lumens of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lux, the definition is
[SPEAKER_00]: a lumen per meter squared is a lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight is about 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foot candles, by the way, FC, we used to
use those, is a lumen per foot squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the metric equivalent of foot
candles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put this in here just because it tells
the brightness of a light for the human
[SPEAKER_00]: eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing directly to do with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These turns out have quite a bit to do
with plants because we want to accurately
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnose subtle differences in color of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher this color fidelity index,
the better we can see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is a graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It screens two, three, four, and five are
summary metrics of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope you love this instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been using it in my laboratory at
the university, the graduate students and
[SPEAKER_00]: I, and this is the go-to instrument
because it's so fast and easy to use and
[SPEAKER_00]: it gives you these ratios right on the
instrument itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
