[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Apogee Instruments Oxygen
Sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unlike most of our sensors,
this sensor is user calibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know exactly where you plan on
using your sensor, so in order to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: most accurate results, we have you,
the customer, calibrate this sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't worry, I'll walk you through the
steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, calibrating an oxygen sensor can be
as simple or a little more involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the level of accuracy that
you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you how to get good,
better, and best results with your oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you stick to the end, I'm going to
show you a tip for getting high humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements, like in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are two key steps to getting
accurate oxygen measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we're going to talk about
calibrating the sensor, both the
[SPEAKER_01]: standalone sensor and the handheld meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll talk about correcting those
test measurements to get your final
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where things can get a little more
complicated, depending on your level of
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these instructions and formulas can be
found in the Apogee Instruments Oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensor user manual.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the standalone sensor, you're going to
need a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need your oxygen sensor,
a multimeter or a data logger,
[SPEAKER_01]: a calibration spreadsheet, which is
available at apogeeinstruments.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: or by clicking the description below,
or there should be a link right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, you're going to need your
calibration locations, altitude or
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, humidity, and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are typically available from your
local weather station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your calibration should be performed
outdoors in an open air environment near
[SPEAKER_01]: your test site.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be calibrated outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're at sea level or on top of
Mount Everest, the oxygen concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: will be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to be 20.95%.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you go inside, that oxygen
concentration number can begin to vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that as you're calibrating the
sensor, you also do it in an environment
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't have wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wind running across the port can cause
different pressure changes, making your
[SPEAKER_01]: calibration off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you're outside in a location
that's not windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now we're going to calibrate our
standalone sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we want to make sure that the
sensor is upright or that the measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: port is pointing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: By pointing the sensor down, it gives us
the strongest signal, the least amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll take our multimeter and measure
the black and the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure that the black and
the wires don't touch because as the
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen sensor is taking measurements,
it produces a signal which could cause
[SPEAKER_01]: problems and short things out if they were
to touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll clip onto both of these wires,
and after a couple of seconds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should see that the voltage will start
to level out.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we wait for a second, you'll see it's
kind of hovering around 45.145 even.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the number that we want to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to use that and plug it into
the spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do, we're going to calibrate
the handheld meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: To calibrate the handheld meter,
we want to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that it's pointing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll turn on the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll press the mode button twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see run start to flash,
and then we'll press the sample and the
[SPEAKER_01]: mode button at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll then see the screen flash cal,
and it's calibrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it'll be done, and it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can calibrate the meter as often as
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure that you're outside when
you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's go back inside and
plug that millivolt number into the
[SPEAKER_01]: spreadsheet and get our calibration
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we have that value, let's open up
the spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, you can check in the
description below for that link.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we'll select our sensor model.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice that things aren't working,
make sure you enable edit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter that recorded voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then enter the calibration location's
temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, and elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at the bottom, it'll give you that
multiplier and the offset.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use this sample info section to
make environmental corrections to data
[SPEAKER_01]: points that you had previously taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your sensor is now calibrated,
and now you have a basic linear equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: To begin taking measurement of relative
oxygen concentration, this will provide
[SPEAKER_01]: good relative oxygen concentration data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for better data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you take the sensor outside and
measure the oxygen outside, you should see
[SPEAKER_01]: a straight line because it's always going
to be 20.95.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, if you actually did that,
you'd start to see these waves start to
[SPEAKER_01]: occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to come from the
barometric pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concentration is still 20.95%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is the amount of air is
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to account for the barometric
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you use an equation like this,
it's going to include the barometric
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, and then it's going to calibrate
it so that way you don't have these
[SPEAKER_01]: swings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity and temperature are going to put
some noise into your readings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want the best data, then in your
measurements you need to include these
[SPEAKER_01]: equations so that way you can offset the
temperature, the humidity, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: barometric pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you account for those and barometric
pressure, then you're going to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: best data.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you plan on taking measurements in a
high humidity environment such as soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's ideal to calibrate the sensor in
a location where the relative humidity is
[SPEAKER_01]: also 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: A simple way to do this is by mounting the
sensor in a sealed chamber over water with
[SPEAKER_01]: ambient air filling the head space.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we're going to create my little
chamber here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you how to make that chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make a high humidity
calibration chamber for our oxygen sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, the sensor is going to mount
to the top of the container and kind of be
[SPEAKER_01]: mounted and oriented vertically where we
will fill this with some sort of humid
[SPEAKER_01]: material, and then we will do the
calibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we'll do is we'll just take the
lid off this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take a little sealing lock nut that
goes with that oxygen sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll trace the inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll know that we just need to make
the hole slightly larger than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very carefully, we'll cut this hole
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you don't hurt yourself because
that would be bad, as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure this hole is as close
to round as we can because we don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: air pressure to get out or humidity to get
out or I guess air pressure getting in
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, we just want to keep that
humidity as high as we can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will cut this center part out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always a chance that we might
have to go and make it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Test fit the sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tight, but we want it to be tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put our sealing ring above that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll screw the nut on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, we should have a good
connection between the oxygen sensor and
[SPEAKER_01]: our high humidity chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you've made that chamber,
we just need to create that humid
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
put some warm water in this container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put some paper towels in it so that it
doesn't swash around so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want water coming in contact
with the sensor itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used paper towels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've gotten some warm water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also just leave water out in the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has to be a warm environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just want to make sure that
the air pressure is equalized between the
[SPEAKER_01]: sky and our container.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll close this on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll wait for just a few minutes
for the humidity to build up in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the humidity has built up,
we're going to do the same thing as we did
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to connect our voltage meter
and read that voltage between the white
[SPEAKER_01]: and the black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for a few seconds for that voltage to
settle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do the same thing as we did
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is going to be the number that
we're going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to make sure that you
calibrate it in an environment that's high
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, as close to 100% as you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure that as you're sealing it
that you're outside when you seal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, the air pressures are equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has that 20.95% in the container
when you close it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have all the information that
you need to take high quality oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: For any more questions, please refer to
the sensor's user manual or contact the
[SPEAKER_01]: support team at Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, leave any questions that you might
have in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And happy measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
See you next time.
