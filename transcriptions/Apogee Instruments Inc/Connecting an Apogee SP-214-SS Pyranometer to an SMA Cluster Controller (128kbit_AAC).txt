[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith,
and I do technical sales support here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're going to talk about how to
connect the SP214 pyrometer to the SMA
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster controller, a very popular
controller among commercial solar
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the SP214 is our 4 to 20 milliamp
pyrometer output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, first thing to note, this video is
for serial numbers of 9898 or higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can determine that by looking at
the white label next to your pyrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your sensor looks like this,
where it has the old tailboard like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's serial numbers below 9898,
that is on a different video, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find that on our website,
apogeeinstruments.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to note when you're
getting ready to wire up the sensor is the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance from your power supply right here
to your X8 terminals over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if, in our case, we needed to take
off some additional of the shield here,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the outer jacket, and so we went ahead
and took off about 8 more inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it comes with 8 inches already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we did that, then we went ahead
and wired up our red and our black right
[SPEAKER_00]: here to our screw and terminals,
red into positive, black into negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next thing we did is we had to
take a jumper wire, and we went from the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative of the power supply over here to
A3 on the X8 terminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take our white signal output
and we run that into the A2 terminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took our shield and run that
into A4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you wire it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: To check and verify that that's wired up
correctly, you can push down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller until you see analog current
input.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our example, you can see it says 4.01
milliamp, which with our studio lights is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we would expect in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we push down two more times,
we see that it says insulation at 1 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing you need to do is you do
need to set up that insulation curve,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you do that through the user interface
where you connect this to your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you're in that user interface,
then you go to the meteorology section,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you click on environmental,
and then you click on irradiance sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you change the range to be from zero
to 2,000 watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, it's a four to 20 milliamp
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you change that there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That completes how to wire up the SP214 to
the SMA cluster controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to watch our other video on the
PV100, which explains how to connect the
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient air temperature sensor as well as
the back of panel temperature sensor to
[SPEAKER_00]: the SMA cluster controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
