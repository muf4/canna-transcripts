[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Apogee Chlorophyll
Concentration Meter, and if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor your plant's health, then this is
an incredibly handy tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put, a greener plant is a healthier
plant, and that greenness is created by
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is responsible for turning H2O
and CO2 into glucose, or the food that a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more chlorophyll a plant has,
the more food a plant gets, and that means
[SPEAKER_00]: happier, healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracting and measuring chlorophyll used
to be an incredibly expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: time-consuming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention, punching holes in a
plant's leaves is super destructive to a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to learn more about the
technical science behind how this meter
[SPEAKER_00]: works, and how we were able to convert the
greenness of a plant into quantifiable
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll, then watch this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into detail about creating the
reference indexes that are used in this
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to watch that video,
just know that essentially this meter
[SPEAKER_00]: measures the greenness of a plant,
and then converts that number into a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific index equation, giving you a
chlorophyll concentration amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does tracking chlorophyll help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: By knowing the chlorophyll concentration
amount, you can begin to track your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you start tracking chlorophyll,
over time, you'll start to see trends
[SPEAKER_00]: emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, as you see the plant start to
grow, you'll see the chlorophyll amount
[SPEAKER_00]: start to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll will start to rise until
it reaches its maximum chlorophyll levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the ideal amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this ideal amount is different for
every species.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time, we get people asking,
what's the ideal chlorophyll amount for my
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the truth is, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ideal chlorophyll amount is actually
determined by you.
[SPEAKER_00]: By measuring your crops over time,
you'll start to understand how much
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll is typically in your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through testing, you might be able to
push those levels up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind, measuring chlorophyll
is like taking your body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your body temperature goes up or
down, really, it's only telling you that
[SPEAKER_00]: something is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't specifically say what is causing
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only indicates that you're not as
healthy as you normally are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's similar to how a chlorophyll
concentration meter will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't tell you exactly what's happening
with your plants, just that the health is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing or decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, you might start to notice a
fade or a dip in the chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could indicate something like a
nitrogen deficiency, water stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: or other factor that's influencing your
plant's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a similar way, you could test two
different kinds of fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you might see the rise or fall of
specific plants that you tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not see the subtle changes with
your eye, but that's why we've created
[SPEAKER_00]: this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes in extremely helpful if you
want to monitor your plant's health for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing or for maximizing a plant's health
for crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, this tool can be worth its
weight in gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's take a brand new meter,
and I'll show you what's inside the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we open the box, we'll see we have our
chlorophyll concentration meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 9-volt battery, a USB cable,
and some sensor area reducers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sensor reducers come in really handy
if you're trying to measure a leaf that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk more about that in just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pull the meter out of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the cover off the back by pushing it
down and sliding it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the battery and do the large terminal
on the large pad and the small terminal on
[SPEAKER_00]: the small pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick the bottom in first and push it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the cover on the back and slide it up
and lock it in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should turn on automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, press the power button in
the bottom right corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you want to learn more about how to
set up the meter as far as like time and
[SPEAKER_00]: date, and perhaps you want to do sample
averaging, then watch this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into greater detail about the fine
details of this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I'm simply going to show you
how to select a species and then how to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a measurement, and then how to get
the data from the meter onto your
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, from the main home screen,
press the run button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to select your species,
press the setup button.
[SPEAKER_00]: To select the species, you're going to
want to press up through the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have a screen that will say
custom measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to measure in CCI units,
change that to no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want core fill concentration or
SPAD units, click yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To change it, click the edit button and
then press up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the yes highlighted, press the right
arrow button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from here, it'll give you a list of
all the different species that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a list of all the species that are
available as of January 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all those species are in
alphabetical order in the meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find the one that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see the exact species you're
looking for, find the species that's
[SPEAKER_00]: closest to the one that you're testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you still see the one you're looking
for, there is a generic curve that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available and works with most species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll up and down until you find the
species you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do generic because this
specific plant is not on this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hit accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll say down below the unit file saying
generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're ready to start testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit the exit button and then press the
measure button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do know that core fill amounts are
different for different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the proper species selected,
it's time to take a measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to ask you to hold down the
sensor and wait for it to calibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use your thumb and push the arm down
and hold it down until it says it's done
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll say calibrate okay, and then release
arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you do have data stored on this
device, it'll ask you what you want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you want to overwrite,
whether you want to append to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you want to cancel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're going to overwrite so
we can start off fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's ready to start taking
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically a good idea to be
consistent in your measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're measuring the same
leaf in the same area from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this example, we're going to take the
third leaf from the top and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it on the meatiest part of the
leaf, away from as much of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: structure as we can possibly get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hold it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll say busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take a measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll say done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll display the amount of
chlorophyll in there and you're ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: take your next measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, there is a video
that goes into detail about how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: sample averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to average the samples of the
leaves of your plant, that's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaf is too small and doesn't cover
the sample area, you can always use those
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor reducers that I mentioned
previously that are found in the kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sample is too small or the leaf is
too thick, keep in mind you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: inaccurate measurements or an insufficient
light error.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you're done taking measurements on
your device, it's time to put them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got our computer and
pretty much this is going to work exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: like a USB thumb drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab your USB cable, plug it in the
computer, plug it into the meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: With it plugged in, turn on the meter and
you can do that by pressing the power
[SPEAKER_00]: button in the bottom right corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a second for it to load
and once it's done, you're going to press
[SPEAKER_00]: the data button, the one in the middle,
and then it should pop up on your
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see it pop up, you might need
to go searching for it, but it should just
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: However your flash drives typically work
when you plug them into your computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll do exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it pops up, you're going to see a big
list of files.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you have all the specie
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you look through these files,
you'll see a bunch of table files or tab
[SPEAKER_00]: files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all the specie files.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever need to add more crops,
to your meter, then this is how you would
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just copy those files and put it on
this device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you're looking through these files,
you'll notice that one is different than
[SPEAKER_00]: the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a CSV file and so you can
either open it in Excel or you can open it
[SPEAKER_00]: in WordPad or whatever your spreadsheet is
of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, I'm just going to open it
with WordPad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have it all separated in
that comma separated value style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to tell you the sample
number, it's going to tell you the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to tell you the date,
and it's going to tell you the measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever units you measured it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did chard or whether you did
lettuce, it's going to tell you what
[SPEAKER_00]: profile you're using and then it's going
to give you the chlorophyll readings or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reading it is that you measured
it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you measured it in SPAD units,
it's going to be in SPAD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you measured it in CCI, it's going to
be in CCI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can copy this data and put it into
your data analysis program of choice and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start doing your research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To turn it off, just press the eject
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to tell you to unplug the cable
and then if you want you can turn off the
[SPEAKER_00]: meter and you're good to go.
