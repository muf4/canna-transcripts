[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome, my name is Skyler Smith
and we're going to talk about oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors from Apogee Instruments today and
which one is right for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of our frequently asked
questions from technical support here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the topics that we're going to
go over and discuss today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and jump right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what does the Apogee SO
oxygen sensors measure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they measure gaseous oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's in soil or in the air or in
a chamber, it's gaseous versus oxygen that
[SPEAKER_00]: is in liquid, that is dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments does not actually carry
a dissolved oxygen sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the difference from the SO-100 and
SO-200 series?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer this question, we are going
to just pull up the website here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are at apogeeinstruments.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just come over here to oxygen
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then across the bottom here,
we're going to scroll down to get to our
[SPEAKER_00]: products and then we're going to compare
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's click on the four options that
we, the four different sensors that we
[SPEAKER_00]: sell here and hit compare selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the simple answer is the difference
between the SO-100 and SO-200 series is
[SPEAKER_00]: the signal size versus response time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the two trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensitivity you can see on the 100
series here and here is about 2.6
[SPEAKER_00]: millivolts per percent O2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sensitivity does vary by sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 200 series is around 0.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that equates to us here in
Logan is that at 20.9% ambient air oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's around 50 millivolts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the 200 series, it's around 12
millivolts at 20.9% oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a difference in signal size
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the trade-off is your response
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 200 series has a response time around
14 seconds, whereas the response time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the 100 series is 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So larger signal, longer response time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, do I need to measure the sensor body
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is, well, it depends on
what your application temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using the SO-110 series and
you look between 15 and 35 degrees C,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see there's very little
temperature compensation that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: account for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not even need to measure the
sensor body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, however, you're outside these ranges,
or you're using the SO-200 series,
[SPEAKER_00]: then yes, you definitely want to measure
the sensor body temperature and then make
[SPEAKER_00]: those corrections accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer is, should I choose a
thermistor or a thermocouple model?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever your particular data logger is or
data acquisition unit or which one you
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer, that's what you should go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, it's our recommendation
to go with the thermistor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think they make better and more
accurate measurements, but it is up to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to have the heater powered to
read the oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is no, you can read the oxygen
without the heater being plugged in.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're anywhere where the
water can condense on the membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you are going to want to have that
heater plugged in so that it is always
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporating off that and giving you those
accurate oxygen readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I measure the oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our wiring diagram for the
thermistor models, either the SO-110 or
[SPEAKER_00]: SO-210 models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red and the black right here,
that's your oxygen reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it either single-ended or
differential measurement, but just by
[SPEAKER_00]: reading the voltage right there on the red
and the black, that's going to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: your oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have your clear right here,
and that's just the earth ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have your green, orange,
and white, and that's so you can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: thermistor measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have your red and blue,
and that is just your heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three different components doing three
different things, but to read oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just need to be able to read the
voltage off of the red and the black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which accessory head should I choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're in a room or a chamber,
you may not need anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just have it sitting there or
reading however you'd like it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in soil, media, dirt,
or the ground, then I recommend the AO001
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're in a lab, somewhere you
want the tubes connected, the quarter inch
[SPEAKER_00]: tubes, then go with the AO002 that you can
just connect that quarter inch tubing to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that concludes our brief oxygen
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to email us with any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
I'll see you next time.
