[SPEAKER_00]: When repairing or lengthening an
instrument cable, making a proper wire
[SPEAKER_00]: splice that is durable and weatherproof is
easy when you follow these instructions
[SPEAKER_00]: and use an Apogee Instruments wire splice
kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you begin, please gather these
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the following demonstration,
we'll be using 26 gauge 2 conductor
[SPEAKER_00]: shielded cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: For other kinds of wire, the process is
the same, but you will need an additional
[SPEAKER_00]: solder sleeve for each conductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strip the outer cable insulation 5 eighths
of an inch, while stripping and tinning
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual wires 1 quarter of an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that tinning the individual lead
wires helps to eliminate cold solder
[SPEAKER_00]: joints by cleaning the individual strands
and allowing solder to flow more freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide the solder sleeves onto the wires,
making sure the tin ends are inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: solder rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide the outer heat shrink onto one of
the cables to the side of the splice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to slide it far enough onto the
cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide the cable away from the joint so the
heat gun will not heat it up before you're
[SPEAKER_00]: finished with the next steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide the cable that is to be spliced into
the other end of the solder sleeve,
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure the tin ends are inside the
solder rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verify that the wires match up,
for example red to red, black to black,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat the solder sleeves using a heat gun
until the solder flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove the heat and be careful not to pull
on the cable and individual wires until
[SPEAKER_00]: the solder is set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide the polyolefin adhesive lined heat
shrink over the junction of the wires.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will seal the splice from the
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow an extra 1 inch of coverage by the
heat shrink on the outer jacket of cable
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure a good seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the heat gun and notice that the heat
shrink is forming tightly to the cable and
[SPEAKER_00]: splice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adhesive lined heat shrink will have a
glossy look once the glue has flowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to overheat the heat
shrink.
[SPEAKER_00]: If overheated, it will start to warp and
eventually melt away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow all the parts to cool before moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please note that the heat shrink will be
flexible when warm, but will hold an angle
[SPEAKER_00]: if left bent while it's cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a small amount of adhesive
coming from the heat shrink ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When done properly, a cable splice can be
just as weatherproof as the jacket itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we use Atom brand heat shrink and
have conducted tests showing that it's at
[SPEAKER_00]: least as impermeable to water ingress as
the cable's Santa Fe jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless otherwise noted, adhesive lined
heat shrink has a difficult time adhering
[SPEAKER_00]: to Teflon cable, also known as PTFE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
