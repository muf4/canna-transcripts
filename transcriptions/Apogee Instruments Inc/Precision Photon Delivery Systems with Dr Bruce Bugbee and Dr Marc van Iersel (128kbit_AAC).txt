[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugby, president of Apogee
Instruments and professor at Utah State
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're honored today to have my colleague,
my long-term colleague, Mark Van Ersel
[SPEAKER_00]: here with us at the Apogee recording
studio, both to visit at my laboratory at
[SPEAKER_00]: the university to talk about science,
but also to talk about commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: implications of all that science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark and I have been colleagues for many,
many years, many decades even,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've shared students back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a wonderful collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing we want to talk about today is
exemplified here on the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call precision photon delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we live in an era with LEDs,
wow, they give us unprecedented ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the delivery of photons,
and not just photons, focused photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: but changes in timing of the photon
delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, when we say precision
delivery, today we're going to mostly talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about precision delivery in time of these
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mark, do you want to start by,
how has your university research informed
[SPEAKER_00]: this, and how has that led to your,
Mark has a company called Candidas that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes software and hardware to achieve
precision photon delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's right in the middle of all of
this, but do you want to comment on how
[SPEAKER_00]: your university research has informed all
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely, and thank you for having
me today, Bruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started working on lighting research
about eight years ago, and when I decided
[SPEAKER_01]: to do so, what I identified as a niche
that nobody else seemed to be paying
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to, was how can we actually
control LED light fixtures very precisely
[SPEAKER_01]: to give plants the amount of light that
they need at the time that they need it
[SPEAKER_01]: and can use it most efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we started out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, we have gotten a big USDA
grant, where we are collaborating with
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce's Utah State University Lab,
but we're also collaborating with
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic electrical engineers and people
in energy informatics who have helped me
[SPEAKER_01]: see the bigger picture of how you can
actually do this, how you can optimize
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, and how this can impact society
at large, which ultimately makes all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this work much more exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a fascinating evolution over
the past eight years, where I've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of things from working with lots of
people who know things that I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to elaborate on that for the
listeners, it's probably close to five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago now, we collaborated on a large
grant to the USDA to look at optimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project came to be called the LAMP
project, and I think you're the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: coined that phrase, L-A-M-P, lighting
approaches to maximize profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the USDA is very interested in
optimizing this, and the whole thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, with USDA funds and collaboration
of multiple laboratories, we've done a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been a great project,
and so it's not just plant scientists that
[SPEAKER_01]: are involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the key word, actually,
in the title of the project is profits,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when we think profits, we have to
think economics, because Bruce and I
[SPEAKER_01]: typically really tend to focus on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we grow plants, and that's really
fascinating stuff, but if we don't take
[SPEAKER_01]: into account the cost associated with
that, then ultimately, we're not serving
[SPEAKER_01]: the controlled environment agriculture
industry, plant factories and greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: in the way that we need to, because yes,
they need to grow plants, but more than
[SPEAKER_01]: that, what they have to do is be as
profitable as they can be, and that has
[SPEAKER_01]: really required this interdisciplinary
work to get these different perspectives
[SPEAKER_01]: on how we can do things beyond just plant
science and horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and this Grant Rielt joke,
because the currency for us as professors
[SPEAKER_00]: is a bunch of referee journal articles,
which as you know can be pretty egghead
[SPEAKER_00]: journal articles, and the USDA doesn't
want to see a bunch of egghead referee
[SPEAKER_00]: journal articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see boots on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see how all of this work is
going to help growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that is actually where my
company can also play an important role.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as academics, we can develop all these
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try them on a relatively small scale,
but as academics, we have relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: little incentive from our institutions to
try to make sure that these new
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies actually get implemented at
scale throughout the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so at Candidus, we are very focused,
of course, in making sure that we get this
[SPEAKER_01]: technology into commercial facilities,
and we have an additional project with a
[SPEAKER_01]: different branch of the USDA, the National
Resources Conservation Service,
[SPEAKER_01]: where Candidus works with them on not just
showing that we can achieve significant
[SPEAKER_01]: energy reductions through better lighting
control methods, but what we really are
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on there in the long term is to
develop guidelines to develop incentive or
[SPEAKER_01]: rebate programs for the industry to help
them get this technology into their
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that is a really exciting
long-term thing because those incentive
[SPEAKER_01]: programs are going to really help make
this technology accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certain utility companies,
especially in the northeast of the US,
[SPEAKER_01]: are already providing rebates not just for
better lights, but for better lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: control systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really see this movement happening,
and that's a great impact of Project LAMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most people know now that
every passing year, there are fewer and
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer high-pressure sodium lamps used and
more and more LEDs used, as the LEDs get
[SPEAKER_00]: both more reliable and more
cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, it's a nice synergism
between us because, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to precisely measure the
photons, and then you use the software to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to deliver the photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the change from high-pressure
sodium fixtures to LED fixtures is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important when you think about controlling
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: With high-pressure sodium, maybe you have
some ability to dim them, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what fixtures you're using, but once they
take some time to heat up and give you
[SPEAKER_01]: full light output, once you turn them off,
they need time to cool down before you can
[SPEAKER_01]: turn them back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't get real precise control over
how much supplemental light you're
[SPEAKER_01]: providing in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: With LED fixtures, almost all of those are
fully dimmable at this point in time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that dimmability allows us to very
precisely control exactly how much
[SPEAKER_01]: supplemental light we provide in response
to how much sunlight is available at that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So LEDs have really opened up a whole new
area to make this lighting control much
[SPEAKER_01]: more beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all of us at our research
greenhouses were pushing the envelope with
[SPEAKER_00]: high-pressure sodium, trying to cycle them
faster to get this variable control,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we burned up a lot of capacitors and a
lot of high-pressure sodium lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to push them to the edge,
and that was expensive, having to rebuild
[SPEAKER_00]: these lights all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that people don't think
about much with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think, okay, great, they're more
efficient, but man, they're so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: controllable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just on the threshold of taking
advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really think that it is the next
frontier, and when I would talk to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry about this topic two or three
years ago, people would go, that's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting, never thought about this,
but I was at a trade show just two months
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, and it's really satisfying to see
that we have to explain much less what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing because people are getting the
concept, and I think when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, control of how many photons we
deliver when is really the next frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: LED fixtures are great, but they're
starting to push to the theoretical limit
[SPEAKER_01]: of how good they can be, and advances in
the efficacy of LED fixtures, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to slow down, but we can still make
big improvements on actually how we use
[SPEAKER_01]: those fixtures in commercial facilities
and in research facilities as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: An analogy, I guess as teachers,
we're always trying to think of analogies
[SPEAKER_00]: that help explain things, but analogy for
me is being like a high-performance
[SPEAKER_00]: athlete where when you eat and what you
eat makes a big difference in your
[SPEAKER_00]: performance, and here with HBS,
well, you can have a steak dinner or not a
[SPEAKER_00]: steak dinner, and now we could have almost
the equivalent of precision intravenous
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding to deliver the photons at just the
right time for maximum performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are really good quantum sensors
available, of course, including from
[SPEAKER_01]: Apogee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That information is really critical,
but you can interface those with really
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap microcomputers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can take those readings, apply really
advanced algorithms to that real-time data
[SPEAKER_01]: that feeds in, and then those
microcomputers can send a signal back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the light fixtures and tell those light
fixtures, exactly what they need to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: and at Candidus, we tell light fixtures
every 15 seconds what change we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make to make sure that by the end of the
day or by the end of the growing cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: that crop has received just enough light
to grow exactly how it needs to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but without providing more light than is
really required, and that excess light
[SPEAKER_01]: that is often provided in greenhouses is
really expensive, and in some cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, that can make the difference
between a greenhouse being profitable
[SPEAKER_01]: versus losing money, and so we really want
to push those facilities towards
[SPEAKER_01]: profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a partly cloudy day, when the sun comes
out, you can turn your lights down because
[SPEAKER_00]: you got sunlight, but five minutes later,
sun goes behind a cloud, and now you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn them back up, and of course,
this is what we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: that level of controllability.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, Mark just gave an invited
talk at a controlled environments
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a conference in Tucson that we both
were at, but he gave a talk about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wonder if you could talk about,
elaborate a bit more on the variable price
[SPEAKER_00]: of electricity and how that enters into
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that is a really fascinating
topic, and the reason that we are working
[SPEAKER_01]: on this topic at the University of Georgia
is because I have colleagues in
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering and energy informatics who
understand these things much better than I
[SPEAKER_01]: do, but it seems pretty intuitive that if
you have variable electricity prices over
[SPEAKER_01]: the course of a day, you want to provide
as much supplemental light as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: during times of the day that electricity
is relatively cheap, and so my colleagues
[SPEAKER_01]: in engineering have developed algorithms
that can take advantage of that variable
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity price, and now the goal is no
longer to minimize the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: supplemental light that we provide to meet
a crop's need, and that's what I did in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now able to actually control lights
based on how can we minimize the cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: that electricity, and of course,
when you think about that from a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial perspective, that is really
what they need to do, and so we have
[SPEAKER_01]: developed algorithms that can do this
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those algorithms reduce the cost of
electricity use by about 35% over less
[SPEAKER_01]: sophisticated methods that are actually
probably still better than what is
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly used in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, at Candidus, we have done a
number of trials in commercial greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: with our proprietary lighting control
approach, and we typically reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity use by about 30% without a
notable impact on the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants grow just as well, but that is
a lot of money that you end up saving
[SPEAKER_01]: because the cost of providing supplemental
light in a greenhouse can easily be
[SPEAKER_01]: $60,000, $70,000 per acre over the course
of a lettuce growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can cut that by about a third,
that's, in my book, quite a bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody understands the issues of
variable electricity pricing, other than
[SPEAKER_00]: we know they often vary, but when a
utility company gets the infrastructure to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide electricity, if they don't use it,
it's hard to store electricity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so they end up purchasing electricity
that they can't use certain times of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, and they would love to have customers
use that surplus electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the opposite, the common thing is
late in the afternoon, everybody's air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioners come on, and now the cost of
electricity is just enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we could just turn the lights off
during those periods of peak demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this interface between big greenhouse
growers and utility companies has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to help the utility companies
efficiently utilize their capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and what we have actually seen in
the past weeks in the United States is
[SPEAKER_01]: that people in California have been asked
to turn off their air conditioning units
[SPEAKER_01]: or turn up the AC to maybe 78 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas has massive problems with their
utility network not being able to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: enough power for all of their customers
during peak times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually at Candidus, we have
collaborated quite a bit with utility
[SPEAKER_01]: companies to try to help them shift the
electricity using greenhouses away from
[SPEAKER_01]: those peak hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a really important topic for
utility companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I think ultimately we need
to get the control environment ag industry
[SPEAKER_01]: hooked up with the utility industry so
that we can come up with solutions that
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually beneficial for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully we can have a positive
impact on society as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really focused on creating a
win-win-win scenario there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you tell people, just suffer,
turn your AC up, they're not very happy
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't usually consider the plants
get happy or sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just tell them we're going to give
you the photons a little later,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants grow just as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the issue here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan, that's actually an interesting topic
because the conventional wisdom and what
[SPEAKER_01]: we tend to do in controlled environment
agriculture is we want to control
[SPEAKER_01]: everything really precisely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those of us who are working in
controlled environment agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: we tend to be, as I like to say,
control freaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've actually done quite a bit of
research at the university that has shown
[SPEAKER_01]: that plants actually don't really care
about that precision control.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're perfectly happy if you give them
more light now, less light later,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe more light today, less light
tomorrow, and that was, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: was really surprising to us, but it was
also really exciting because that now
[SPEAKER_01]: allows us to really take advantage of time
periods that electricity is relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap and it's provide a whole new
frontier for this precision photon
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery because we don't have to keep the
light levels in a greenhouse as stable as
[SPEAKER_01]: we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can be really beneficial for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to switch topics a little bit,
I want to ask you about how did you choose
[SPEAKER_00]: the name Candidas for your company?
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me, how did you choose Apogee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the point in an orbit farthest
from the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was doing a lot of work with NASA,
so that was kind of a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Candidas, that's an unusual name.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you come up with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of an interesting and maybe
funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my co-founder, Errico Matos,
asked me if I was willing to co-found a
[SPEAKER_01]: company with him to work on lighting
control systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yes, I'd be excited to work on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the very first thing we
needed to do was figure out, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the name of that company going to
be?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spent an evening on the internet and
I was interested in either Greek or Latin
[SPEAKER_01]: words that had some connection to light
because our focus, of course, is on light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found all kinds of terms,
but most of those were already in use by
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of other companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I finally came across Candidas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the meanings in Latin is light,
but an other meaning that pushed it over
[SPEAKER_01]: the edge is gray hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent an email to Errico.
[SPEAKER_01]: I explained it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He laughed and agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the official spokesperson for the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wise elders helping you better utilize
your photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mark, it's been a great run that
we've had back and forth over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so exciting to be working in an
area that has both lots of opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: profound scientific discoveries,
but commercial opportunities too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very synergistic for both of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you well know, it's really exciting if
you can take the work that you do at a
[SPEAKER_01]: university and through a company really
help to scale the work that we do in an
[SPEAKER_01]: academic setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are lots of things in my career
that have been rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps the most important thing is all
the people that I've worked with,
[SPEAKER_01]: the graduate students that I have trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think now seeing this technology
spread through the industry, that is
[SPEAKER_01]: really rewarding in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can tell that we're making a
positive impact, not just on the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think we're having a positive impact
on society too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really exciting to be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meeting, it was this last week that
we were together in Tucson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a controlled environments conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that first started a long time
ago, back when we were much younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a bunch of academics sitting around
a small table discussing science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the whole meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the basic science found
applications, commercial people started to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to come to the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, come to the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the group grew, and it grew,
and it grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth chamber people come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of LED people come to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instrument companies come to this meeting
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we had over 200 people at our
last meeting, which started out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of egghead people discussing some
pretty refined points of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a remarkable transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as you commented on during that
meeting, you've probably been part of it
[SPEAKER_01]: for about 30, maybe a little bit longer
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: And controlled environment was really just
a research tool where we could do
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do research that then might or
might not have practical applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it was pretty basic research that
was done in growth chambers, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you now think about controlled
environments, there is a very large
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environment agriculture
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a number of large vertical farms,
and they keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the greenhouse side, the greenhouse
vegetable industry is just exploding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that is, at least to some
extent, really a long-term result of the
[SPEAKER_01]: work that people like you were doing 30
years ago already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we see a real transformation of
how we actually grow vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earliest stuff was mostly NASA funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got NASA funding, and NASA can't really
have a greenhouse on the moon or Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be pressurized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meteorites would break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: NASA has to use electric lights in a
closed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, as soon as LEDs came along,
it just exploded for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I remember some of the first
talks at this very meeting about growing
[SPEAKER_01]: plants on LEDs, and it was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw beautiful pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only NASA could actually afford to buy
LEDs because they were so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, they were very,
very bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to what we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a long time, I was not convinced
that this would be something that would
[SPEAKER_01]: ever become commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, by now, it has completely
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And LEDs are really efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably never going to be a
different kind of light that is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come along that is going to replace LEDs,
because LEDs are so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will be the choice for growing
plants, whether it's indoors or indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we both talk about this all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at the history of electric
lighting, if we go back far enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was monks with kerosene lamps walking
from room to room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the energy efficiency of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's teeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tenths of a percent turning energy
into light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Edison invents the incandescent
bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a huge breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got up to like five percent
efficiency and at the time massive
[SPEAKER_00]: breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we after World War Two, we went to
fluorescence and we got into the 15
[SPEAKER_00]: percent efficiency with fluorescent
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we went to high intensity discharge,
high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got into the 30 percent efficiency of
electric lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought, oh, my God, this is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are at LEDs that are 80 percent
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's the end of the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get past 100 and the LEDs are
going to creep up toward 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Theoretically, LEDs can become 100 percent
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will never get to 100, but at some
point will be at 95 percent efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I think it's pretty easy to
predict that there is not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: something else that comes along that is
going to be even better than LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about the likelihood to heat
ratios of things and light is good,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then LEDs, interestingly enough,
when you calculate the light to heat ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: of sunlight, the energy in the photons
versus the total energy of the sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get about two micromoles per joule
from the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the photosynthetic photon flux
divided by total energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And LEDs now were past three micromoles
per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs have caught up and passed the sun for
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fun stat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really thought about the
efficiency of the sun, but that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a really good indication of how
good these LEDs are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other exciting thing,
of course, is that with these LEDs,
[SPEAKER_01]: unlike the high intensity discharge
lights, we can get that precision control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was never going to be possible with
HIDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just the efficiency,
it's also the controllability of these LED
[SPEAKER_01]: fixtures that is going to be really
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about commercial buildings,
in many cases, those lights are already
[SPEAKER_01]: dimming automatically in response to how
much light is coming into the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't notice it because it is gradual
and your eyes adjust to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is one other way in which we can
use these LEDs to be really energy
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why we wanted to have this
discussion about precision timing of
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when people think about LEDs,
they're all about, OK, what's the optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: spectra and what color should I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge subject, which we've talked
about many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, there's this
timing of delivery, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's going to be the next
big advance in lighting control.
[SPEAKER_01]: In control environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think about it, it's obvious in
greenhouses where you have the sunlight
[SPEAKER_01]: that is constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about a plant factory where
the cost of electricity is an even bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the overall production cost,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can respond to those real time
pricing changes that are happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: they could substantially reduce their
electricity cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to require collaboration,
I think, between utility companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: those plant factories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think utility companies are
going to have to provide incentives for
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical farming companies to implement
some of that better approach that can help
[SPEAKER_01]: the utility companies in a big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that comes to
mind for greenhouses is, as you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, if you run your lights late at
night, people complain about the light
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so shift it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's turn them on early in the morning
and off earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people don't complain about light
pollution if the lights come on at 4 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, if they don't go off till 10 p
.m., there's a lot of heartburn about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shift it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are fine doing something like
that, something simple like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's simple for a greenhouse to just
shift that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually creates some interesting
challenges from a control perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we provide a lot of light later
in the day, we have already measured how
[SPEAKER_01]: much sunlight that greenhouse got during
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know exactly how much more light
we need to provide during that evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is, if we provide light
early in the morning, we don't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: much light those plants are going to get
later in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so another thing that we need to
incorporate, I think, in these lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: control algorithms is forecast of how much
solar radiation or how much light is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be available during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can start taking that into
account at 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: when there is no sunlight yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily enough, those forecasts are
readily available because the photovoltaic
[SPEAKER_01]: or solar energy industry is heavily
dependent on those forecasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can simply be purchased from a
variety of companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next thing that we want to look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we do more solar PV, this forecasting
gets super important for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, to match supply with demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are just lucky that that industry
is so dependent on that forecasting
[SPEAKER_01]: because if it was just a greenhouse
industry, I don't think anyone would
[SPEAKER_01]: bother actually developing these
forecasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they're readily available and we
can take advantage of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a great discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we always say, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an evolving thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep getting new research data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always looking for ways to explain
the basic science and find ways to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic science to commercialize it and help
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Bruce, for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for watching our
conversation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Bruce.
