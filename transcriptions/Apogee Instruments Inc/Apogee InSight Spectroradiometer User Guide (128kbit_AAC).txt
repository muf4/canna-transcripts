[SPEAKER_00]: This is the user guide for the Apogee
Insight, the MS100 Spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone, I am super excited to
visit with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have the Apogee Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sweet little handheld
spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it, let's open up the
case and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the case we've got the
certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insight device, soft carrying case,
USB cable, lanyard with lanyard nut,
[SPEAKER_00]: Modbus adapter, and power brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you around the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the front we have an LED indicator
light, an LCD screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left side we've got a power button
or a screen change button, a reset button,
[SPEAKER_00]: the USB port, and a micro SD card port.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back side we have the sensor cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide that open to reveal the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top we have the measurement button,
and on the bottom we have the quarter 20
[SPEAKER_00]: thread mount or a tripod mount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that before the first use of the
Insight that you charge the device for at
[SPEAKER_00]: least six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab the USB power adapter and the
charging data cable, hook them up,
[SPEAKER_00]: plug it into the Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indicator will turn orange when it's
charging.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's completed charging, it'll turn
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell it's charging either by the
orange indicator light or by the icon with
[SPEAKER_00]: the lightning bolt through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Insight is intended for lab and field
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the device is not waterproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you don't put it in the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to show you how to use the
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: To turn it on, press and hold the power
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LED indicator light will turn on and
the device will boot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the shutter on the back is closed,
it'll automatically perform a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that calibration is complete,
you're ready to take a measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a spectral radiometer, it's very
important to make sure that you would do a
[SPEAKER_00]: dark calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ensure the highest accuracy of
measurements, make sure you do it often,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you change environments
such as temperature or humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: To perform a manual calibration,
with the device powered on, close the
[SPEAKER_00]: shutter and then press the measurement
button and it'll perform a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that's been done, it's ready to begin
taking measurements again.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take a measurement, point at the target
light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press the measurement button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take about eight seconds to perform
the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's done, it'll beep.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to prevent inaccurate data,
hold the Insight in place until you hear
[SPEAKER_00]: that second beep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The screen will show you the spectra data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press the power button quickly to change
screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next screen will show you PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And EPPFD or PAR and EPAR, as well as
other various indicators used by
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to save the measurement
data, make sure you insert an SD card into
[SPEAKER_00]: the slot before you take the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll include all the necessary data as
well as a timestamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you write down your location
so you can reference it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: To power off the Insight, press and hold
the power button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to show you how to connect
the Insight to your mobile device.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, go to the app store, either Android
or Apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search Apigee Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the app you're going to want to
download.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you're going to want to
turn on the Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up in the top right corner, you'll see an
icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll either be blue or it'll be red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll tell you whether or not your
device is connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that icon is red, that means your
device is not connected and that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to connect it through Bluetooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's blue, that means the devices are
communicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that icon is blue, you're ready to
begin taking measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the options that you have
available on the Insight mobile app.
[SPEAKER_00]: The browser feature lets you go through
and review different tests and different
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements that you've taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press the home icon in the top left corner
to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take measurements, let's start with the
basic icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, you can see the different
metrics, PPFD, EPPFD, or PAR and EPAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other metrics that are used
throughout the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, with your Insight turned on,
open the shutter and place it under your
[SPEAKER_00]: target light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take a measurement, press the rainbow
camera icon, or in the bottom in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's done, it'll automatically
populate the different metrics that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available on this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see the metric you're looking
for, press the gear icon in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: right corner and click on Basic Selector.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, you can choose from the various
metrics that are preloaded on the Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're done, press the go back in the
top left corner and then press it one more
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to rearrange the order that
these metrics are found in, take your
[SPEAKER_00]: finger, push down, hold on the square,
and then you can drag it around and
[SPEAKER_00]: rearrange it as you desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to the home screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the spectrum data on this
light right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click the spectrum icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Insight under your target light
source, press that capture button or the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainbow circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this will give you the spectra data
on that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to save or share this data,
press the four squares in the bottom left
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there you can save, share,
or open other data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to the home screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: To view the planet-specific spectrum,
press the PPFD spectrum icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will show you the spectrum that's
more conducive to plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's press the home button and go back
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remaining three icons, the CIE and the
CRI, are used in other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, we're not going to go
into too much detail in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information about those,
refer to the user manual in the link
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a quick overview on the mobile
application for the Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Insight has some added features that
are available only with the desktop
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the desktop application,
go to the Apogee Instruments website at
[SPEAKER_00]: apogeeinstruments.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the support column, look for
software downloads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then scroll down until you see the
Insight handheld spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to click and download the
Apogee Insight software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's been installed, it should look
something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, you're now ready to connect the
Insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure the shutter is closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then plug in the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's plugged in, the Insight will
automatically pop up on the device list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the Insight and then click
Connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to remind you to make sure the
cover is closed on the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tell you that the dark
calibration has been completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're ready to begin using the
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the view mode first.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, you can view the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn on your light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open the cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the top, click the capture button.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will capture that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then display it as a spectrum graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to save this data,
share this data, or if you want to load
[SPEAKER_00]: other data, use the icons in the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Left corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use continuous capture to
keep capturing over and over again if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make changes to lights in real
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the bottom right, it shows you the
metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If for some reason you don't see the
metrics you're looking for, click in the
[SPEAKER_00]: box in the top right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then move them and change them as you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the one you'd like to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the one you want to replace it
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shift it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll move it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're done, hit the green check
mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will update those metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to go to log mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In log mode, you can change the different
parameters over on the right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set the interval, how long between
the captures, and for a total time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can do it by how many captures are
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go change this to seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do one every five seconds for a
total of one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can press the start log button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll begin taking those measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're going to start
displaying as they're taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to stop before the total
interval has gone through, press the stop
[SPEAKER_00]: button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to bin mode now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bin mode isn't something we typically do
in our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you want to learn more about it,
click on the link in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes you to the user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go now to the checker mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In checker mode, you can set the
parameters for which you'd like to test
[SPEAKER_00]: the light by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see whether or not it passes
or fails those qualifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice, you can't change those
qualifications right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to unlock them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So click the term lock button to unlock
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from here, you can change them.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you're done changing them,
click the lock button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can press the capture button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that according to these
parameters, this light would pass that
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left side, there are more modes
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use the up and down button on the
bottom left corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go now to the transmit mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In transmit mode, it'll tell you how much
light passes through a material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So click on the standard light to get your
baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, grab your test material and put it
between the light and the insight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then press test sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will tell you how much light was
allowed through and how that spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: might have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: changed over the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last mode is TM30.
[SPEAKER_00]: TM30 is another one of those metrics that
we don't typically use in our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to learn more about it,
click in the description below to the link
[SPEAKER_00]: to the user manual, and it'll explain
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a quick overview of the desktop
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've had a chance to see just how
powerful this little device is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to see what you'll be able
to do with it out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave a comment below with any questions
you have or how you would use the insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
