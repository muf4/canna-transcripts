[SPEAKER_01]: Take a good look at this color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Memorize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna need it in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever looked at your plants and
wondered, how are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, plants don't talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they do, it means it's probably time to
take a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if plants could talk, understanding
their problems would make it so much
[SPEAKER_01]: easier for us to take corrective action to
make them happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, they do talk, just in a language
that we don't speak very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, the greener your
plants, the healthier they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lush green color comes from
chlorophyll, the magic pigment that's
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chlorophyll that allows a plant to
turn sunlight, CO2, and water into
[SPEAKER_01]: glucose, creating food for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, greenness might not be the only
factor in a plant's health, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely one of the key indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the more chlorophyll, the greener the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, it's easy to tell the
difference between a healthy plant and an
[SPEAKER_01]: unhealthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that difference is much harder to
determine when the colors are similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's look at these three
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy to see that they're all
green, but they're not the same green.
[SPEAKER_01]: The human eye is really good at noticing
the differences between colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, we don't remember colors
very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that color I showed you earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which color is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this one right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how'd you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, imagine taking a new color every day
and comparing it to samples from last
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine what that would be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, you can tell which leaf looks
greener as you compare and contrast,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how do you make consistent,
data-driven decisions over time about your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's health?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we really need is a scientific way to
quantify that chlorophyll and,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a result, understand our plant's health
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let Bruce show you what has
been and still is the gold standard for
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get the gold standard,
you have to take that disc out from the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same spot on the leaf that the
measurement was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done with a cork borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it into a little vial of dimethyl
sulfoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different extraction solvents,
but this is the one of choice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you look in here, you can see this
tiny little leaf disc floating in this
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll doesn't come out right
away, and to speed it up, we put it at 65
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's walking over to a drying oven,
putting it in the drying oven with that
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction solvent, and now we wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it typically takes about three hours
until all the chlorophyll is gone from the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf in solution, still 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the vial three hours later,
and now the disc is white and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophylls in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, step one is extract the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one measurement on one leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next step is to bring it into the
laboratory, and measure it, transfer it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a cuvette, measure it in our
spectrophotometer, which scans the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate wavelengths, and then reads
them out on a computer, and we'll zoom in
[SPEAKER_00]: here for you in just a minute on these
values, which show the absorbance of those
[SPEAKER_00]: two wavelengths with those two numbers in
the correct equation now that matches the
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument and the dimethyl sulfoxide,
we can calculate both chlorophyll A and B,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we add the two values together,
and we have chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as long as your laboratory procedures
are correct, this is how you get the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: standard of chlorophyll, but it's
obviously a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: While this method is still highly
accurate, it's time consuming and
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive, but most importantly,
it's destructive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not learning how much chlorophyll
is in your plants, you're learning how
[SPEAKER_01]: much chlorophyll was in your plants that
you just destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, we don't have to destroy our
plants to understand their health.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are various non-destructive methods
that measure the greenness of a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're revolutionizing how we monitor
our plant's health.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two main non-destructive methods
for measuring plants' health, color
[SPEAKER_01]: reflectance and color transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: While they both work in a similar manner,
they're used in very different
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, and both options don't
exactly tell you how much chlorophyll is
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant, but they both give you a
relative measurement of the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: health, and when that data is taken over
time, it begins to tell a story about the
[SPEAKER_01]: health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was taken from the grass behind the
Apogee Instruments building.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the time axis, and we have the
NDVI axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that in the spring,
the grass comes out of dormancy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's even a few late season
snowstorms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can see the happy, healthy grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, you can start to see that
grass become stressed, probably from water
[SPEAKER_01]: or from heat, and it starts to lose that
ideal greenness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, as the months cool down,
you can see the grass return back to its
[SPEAKER_01]: normal, happy, healthy state.
[SPEAKER_01]: These measurements are much like taking
your body temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't tell you exactly what is wrong,
but it will tell you that something is
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong, and knowing there's a problem is
the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we get this kind of data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when light comes in contact with a
leaf, it's going to do a combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: three things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either going to be absorbed,
it's going to be reflected, or the photons
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to bounce around and transmit
through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two primary non-destructive
methods for determining the health of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's light transmission and light
reflectance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first method of measuring plant
greenness is called color reflectance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how NDVI meters work.
[SPEAKER_01]: These devices work much like your eyes,
and they compare how much of the greenness
[SPEAKER_01]: is being reflected by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NDVI sensor measures this greenness by
monitoring two specific wavelengths of
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sensor on top is measuring the incoming
light, and a sensor on the bottom measures
[SPEAKER_01]: the reflected light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since red is the opposite of green,
a green, healthy vegetation is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb most of that red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Near-infrared is going to be the complete
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy plants will reflect a lot of that
near-infrared light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NDVI calculation looks something like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, the output is a value in the
range of negative one to positive one,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the higher values are going to
indicate dense, healthy vegetation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and lower or negative numbers are going to
suggest sparse vegetation, bare soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: or just not green.
[SPEAKER_01]: NDVI is widely used in agriculture,
forestry, and environmental monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: This method is great for non-contact
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't destroy your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you don't even need to touch your
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it ideal for aerial platforms or
remote monitoring of a crop canopy or
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy, but it's just not as accurate
as the next method.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this is option number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is light transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, what happens is the meter is
going to clamp over the meatiest part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shines two wavelengths of near-infrared
and red, similar to NDVI, but this one
[SPEAKER_01]: uses a 931 nanometer and a 625 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, you're going to calibrate and make
a test with no leaf in between to
[SPEAKER_01]: calibrate the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're actually going to take your
measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: A light is going to be shined through the
leaf to the sensor on the other side,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's going to measure how much of
those two wavelengths is passed through
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much like NDVI, the red is going to be
mostly absorbed by the green, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: near-infrared light is going to be mostly
transmitted through the leaf and only
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be obstructed by things like cell
walls and leaf structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most light transmission tools will
then give you a relative light
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission number like CCI or SPAD.
[SPEAKER_01]: This number is much like an NDVI output.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't give you the amount of
chlorophyll, just a relative number of
[SPEAKER_01]: light transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start to see trends of plant
health over time and gain that relative
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more precise because you're taking
measurements on individual leaves and not
[SPEAKER_01]: over the entire crop canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Apogee chlorophyll concentration meter
takes that relative light transmission
[SPEAKER_01]: number, or that CCI, and then takes it a
step farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Apogee MC100 takes that CCI number and
references it to a chlorophyll index
[SPEAKER_01]: reference chart and gives you an actual
amount of chlorophyll in moles per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: This meter is able to do this because of
the painstaking efforts of researchers who
[SPEAKER_01]: took hundreds of measurements using that
gold standard method that Bruce described
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier over multiple species to develop
an index of references for each of the
[SPEAKER_01]: species that are included on this meter,
making it easier to get accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: non-destructive chlorophyll concentration
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two measurement tools make it
possible to assess your plant's health
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately, repeatedly, and most
importantly, without harming your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can plants talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Still no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the right tools, they can tell
you a story about their health.

leave a comment in the comment section
[SPEAKER_01]: below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, better data, better plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.
