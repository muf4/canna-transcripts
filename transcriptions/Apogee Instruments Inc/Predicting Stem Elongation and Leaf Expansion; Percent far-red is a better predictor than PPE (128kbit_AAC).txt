[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee
Instruments, and I want to talk today
[SPEAKER_00]: about our research on pho-red effects on
plant growth and how we measure with
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments those effects on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see from the title right here,
we get two approaches to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the percent pho-red and a more complex
measurement called phytochrome
[SPEAKER_00]: photoequilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to compare those two approaches
to predicting stem length and leaf area in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's the classic method, more complex
instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a new method that has, it's much
simpler and has the potential to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive and more useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work I'm going to talk about is large
been done by my graduate student,
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Kasuma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been in the trenches working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I work on this together every day
to do the research and interpret the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the definitions of
these and then I'll get into the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, phytochrome
photoequilibrium, is the number of waves
[SPEAKER_00]: divided by the rated number of pho-red
photons divided by pho-red and red
[SPEAKER_00]: photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ratio and this ratio ranges from
sun is about 0.8 and as it goes into deep
[SPEAKER_00]: shade it goes to 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this goes down, this number gets
smaller as we get into shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you measure these is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a spectroradiometer and I'm
going to show you exactly how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments spectroradiometers are
pre-programmed to measure this and read
[SPEAKER_00]: out in this number, but you still need to
purchase a spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new emerging option is just percent
pho-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of pho-red photons divided by
the number of total photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any time you take a subset divided by
the total, the total range of the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: is 0 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had electric lights with absolutely
no pho-red, it would be a 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many LEDs have no pho-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ratio goes a little bit, a little
complicated when there's no pho-red at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversely, in very deep shade,
deep shade under a tree, this ratio could
[SPEAKER_00]: be almost all pho-red and it could
approach 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a real simple intuitive ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: To define this, we need to define the
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use 700 to 760 nanometers for the
pho-red component and 400 to 760 for the
[SPEAKER_00]: total.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not quite quantum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quantum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic photons are 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me write that on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 to 700 nanometers is
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's this plus 700 to 760.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sum of those goes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the percent pho-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few background slides are important here
to say how did we come to use phytochrome
[SPEAKER_00]: photoequilibrium, PPE, and rely on it so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with this guy right here,
Harry Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1960s and 70s and into the 80s,
he did pioneering work on the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: colors of light and especially deep shade
on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the citation to his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's his results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's phytochrome photoequilibrium,
PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, this is also called
phytochrome photostationary state,
[SPEAKER_00]: PSS or PPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple different acronyms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all mean the same thing, just
different acronyms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's his results.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew plants in sun and shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at how linear this line is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful predictor of stem extension
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building on this, we've used this now for
many years to predict stem elongation and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works beautifully as long as the
background of light is broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: white light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works beautifully in sun and shade
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we move to LEDs with varying
ratios of red and green and blue
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, I will show you the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some good ideas of why it
breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not as good a predictor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is four people that have studied this
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this, let's take Butler, 1964.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are weighting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 400 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our ratio again, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's PFR, right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sums up all these photons with a
spectroradiometer and it puts it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: numerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also sums up phytochrome red and puts
that, adds it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sum of those two is the
denominator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sums all the wavelengths, which is
terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Butler was one of the first to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's Butler's picture here,
1964.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is well before computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine the work he did is very
pioneering to get these weighting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along comes Pratt and Briggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a picture of Pratt right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1982, he contributed weighting factors to
Gary Gardner, who is at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still working.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made these weighting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to this, but these
weighting factors are different than
[SPEAKER_00]: Butler's, so we don't have universal
agreements for weighting factors to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years past, this is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelly and Lagarius, 1985, come up with a
different set of weighting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, 1988, John Sager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a picture of John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet a different set of weighting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these people had to use tissue with
no chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was usually oat seedlings grown in
the dark, so there was no chlorophyll in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to make these measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the weighting factors are slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardner and Graceffo's weighting factors,
minimal weighting factors for blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more for here, and Kelly and
Lagarius and Sager have slightly more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that this doesn't get big until
ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part right here and this part right
here, these are UV photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often say heavily influenced by
blue, but a careful inspection really
[SPEAKER_00]: should say heavily influenced by UVA
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue responses are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far red, far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are somewhat different in terms of
how much they cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two are quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the literature, in the horticulture
literature, people cite Sager and use
[SPEAKER_00]: Sager's weighting factors, and his papers
are very clearly written.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has nice tables of weighting factors in
the plant physiology and often the ecology
[SPEAKER_00]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: People cite Kelly and Lagarius' weighting
factors, so there's not universal
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think this is a horrible mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have numbers all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out these four curves are close
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The values don't differ that much,
and as long as you pick one and stick with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you can measure relative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the background for the
complicated background for how we came to
[SPEAKER_00]: have phytochrome photoequilibria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were measured with no chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochrome is inside the phytochrome
molecules inside a leaf, and it is covered
[SPEAKER_00]: with chlorophyll all around it,
shaded by chlorophyll, and we make these
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements above the plants,
and we're using that to predict inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Harry Smith cautioned against using
this for complicated light sources because
[SPEAKER_00]: of shading by chlorophyll of the pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to show you a slide made by
Paul Kasuma that brilliantly explains
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this section.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the cells in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's blow this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a single cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleus, this is the vacuole over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cytoplasm are all of these
phytochrome molecules, and they look like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can imagine a person, when their
arms are down, it's inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When their arms go up, it's active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some active molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the light spectra changes,
it hits these, and they move up here to
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleus and interact with the nucleus
and cause the photobiological effects that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wonderful story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we add chlorophyll and more
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phytochrome pigment is buried
underneath a massive amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll, and we don't fully understand
the wavelengths that it sees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul's got some excellent ideas of how
we're going to do this to predict what
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome sees, but it's still going to
take a spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can pause this and study these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a list for academic for good
scholarship.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a list of the papers that I just
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butler, Pratt, Gardner, Kelly,
Sager.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are citations where people have used
PPE successfully, but these papers only
[SPEAKER_00]: varied red and far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't vary green and blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can pause this and write these
down if you want to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, Paul and I decided to
design a study to test this hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were six growth chambers,
all matching, very carefully matched.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one, we had a background of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a cool white LED, very
dominant in the blue, and we added far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plus and minus far-red in this
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get high green, there's not efficient
green LEDs, so we used a high-pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium, and we had plus and minus far-red
with a green background, and plus and
[SPEAKER_00]: minus far-red with a red background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the red in every case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reds were the same percentage in all
these chambers, so there's six treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the plants, not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now done this with multiple species,
but the most reproducible and the most
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive is cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, when we add far-red,
it gets taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they are, taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can we predict stem elongation in all
of these treatments with phytochrome
[SPEAKER_00]: photoequilibrium measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that works, it will explain all of
these treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Professor Smith's original graph,
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the same phytochrome
photoequilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data scatters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chamber with high blue, all of them
slope down, but they have big offsets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from this data, you can't
predict, this is all stem elongation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't predict stem elongation from
PPE, because it varies with the background
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we took a simpler measurement and
we only did percent far-red, that original
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio in the first section.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is, percent far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far-red photons divided by total,
wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lines converge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not perfect, but we've got a much
better estimation of stem elongation than
[SPEAKER_00]: we did from the more complicated
phytochrome photoequilibrium measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now reproduced this with other
species and shown this percent far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: does an impressive job of predicting leaf
area and stem elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell anybody the PPE went from 0.76 to
0.84, and that's hard to know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red was in there, but you say it went
from 1 to 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderfully intuitive ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to have far-red sensors
and quantum sensors and add them up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, Apogee has developed a
sensor with two detectors, one for a
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum sensor and one for far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this one first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has two detectors inside in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's quantum, so this one does PPFD,
the classic square wave PPFD that's in all
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp cutoffs at the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to this, there's a far-red
detector here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It separately measures the two colors and
then adds them together in software.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, from this sensor, what we're after
is far-red over PPFD plus far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That becomes a number between 0 and 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 40 years, we have also measured red
and far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far-red ratios because there are big peaks
in phytochrome and red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sensors have been available for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're widely used in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee also has a red far-red sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two peaks look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful sensor for reproducing
studies in ecology, anything outside under
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start to move to LEDs with their
varied backgrounds, we need to upgrade to
[SPEAKER_00]: this sensor, which Apogee calls the
PAR-FAR sensor because of the PAR and the
[SPEAKER_00]: FAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a simple explanation of why this
ratio is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderfully simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plan to express our data as percent
far-red in our studies to help explain
[SPEAKER_00]: these effects on plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get asked a lot about how these
photobiological ratios apply to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is that my laboratory has a
state license to study cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've applied these ratios to predict
cannabis growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same value in cannabis as
they do in all other crop plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding far-red is both good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the sensor is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to add the right amount at the
right time to get full advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More far-red can make cannabis plants
taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps expand leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's evidence it can help with slightly
earlier flowering, which is another
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is emerging research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important point here is that you need
to have a sensor to see what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have far-red, you can use the
sensor to dial it in and optimize it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
