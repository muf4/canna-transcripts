[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Skyler Smith and today we're
going to talk about the PV Monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: Package available from Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a list of everything included
in the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these sensors is available
separately for your own application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We designed this to go with an SMA cluster
controller, so each of these are
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if for your application you only need
certain ones, feel free to contact us for
[SPEAKER_00]: availability on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the package includes the SP214 solar
radiation sensor, the ST150 air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature sensor, the TS100
fan-aspirated shield, and then the CS240
[SPEAKER_00]: backup panel temperature sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the smaller things are
accessories to help with the installation
[SPEAKER_00]: of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP214 measures your solar radiation in
watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes with a standard five meter
cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a silicon cell detector,
but we calibrate it to match those higher
[SPEAKER_00]: end black body thermopile secondary
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a link here for the
traceability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that same link in the
comments below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we mean by calibrating to those
secondary standards is that our spectral
[SPEAKER_00]: response is from 360 to 1120 nanometers
for the SP214.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we calibrate it to match those high
end secondary standards that have a range
[SPEAKER_00]: of 285 to 2800 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means on a clear sky our SP214 is
going to read the same as those high end
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ST150 ambient air temperature sensor,
it's a class A PRT, IP67 rated,
[SPEAKER_00]: comes standard five meter cable,
and it does meet that IEC standard for air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can just put that in a gill
shield, or we recommend putting it into
[SPEAKER_00]: our active radiation shield, our TS100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in this picture over here
on this cross section how the ST150 would
[SPEAKER_00]: just slide right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea behind this is it's got a fan
in there to circulate the air so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the highest accurate air
temperature possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with that long rated fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with five meter standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular 24 volt step down
converter, again it's designed for that
[SPEAKER_00]: SMA cluster controller that is powered
with 24 volts to step that down to the 12
[SPEAKER_00]: volts needed to run the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as far as that argument between gill
shield and active radiation shield,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did some testing on our roofs to show
the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the blue across the top
here is your passive radiation shield,
[SPEAKER_00]: your gill shield right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the red is our TS100 active
radiation shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your goal is to meet that IEC
61724-1 specification, the uncertainty
[SPEAKER_00]: says it has to be plus or minus one degree
C, and that's in gray on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on our graph here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these blue dots and red dots
are 15 minute averages for measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see when the sun comes out and
gets between 500 and 600 watts per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared, that we're actually outside of
that range with a gill shield,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're outside that one degree C
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to stay within that
particular specification, you really need
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of active shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we recommend the TS100.
[SPEAKER_00]: CS240 backup panel temperature sensor,
class A PRT, highly accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes in your standard cable lengths,
15 and 50 meters in length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also includes that captain
tape for mounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to recap, our PV100 monitoring package
does include everything on this list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 214, the solar mounting bracket with
leveling plate, their temperature sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fan aspirated shield, the step down
converter, and then the backup panel
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature sensor with that captain tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please feel free to contact us by
email, by phone for price and
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll love to get you a quote on that.
