[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Skyler Smith here at Apogee
Instruments and today we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about choosing the right quantum slash PAR
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about what do quantum
slash PAR sensors measure, our original
[SPEAKER_00]: versus full spectrum sensors, the
difference between all the models we
[SPEAKER_00]: offer, the output options available,
and then we're going to talk about our USB
[SPEAKER_00]: output options and how those are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, quantum sensors measure PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR is defined as photosynthetically
active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we measure PAR in units of micromoles
per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the five different series we
offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 100, 200, 300, 400 series are all in
the black and have the blackhead,
[SPEAKER_00]: have our original spectrum response,
and we have our full spectrum over here
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the full spectrum response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to touch on that here
in a minute, but here are some references
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great video from our CEO,
Bruce Bugby, and it's going to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: in-depth explanation of what PAR is,
and you can click on all these links in
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great link here that talks about
the spectral errors by light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can click on that in the
comments below, but that's going to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you based on which type of sensor you go
with, whether that's the original or the
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum, based on what type of light
you have, what type of errors you would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so of course with the full spectrum,
those are going to be pretty small errors
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the electric or sun
calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a link here as well that
just compares all of the sensors together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show that table later in
this video, but if you want, you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: click right there to see that on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, full spectrum versus original spectral
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first we need to define PAR as how
the plant sees light, and we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the dashed line here from 400 to 700
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, that is the spectral response
a PAR sensor would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not able to get that with our
sensors, and so our original one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see it cuts on right here,
cuts out a little bit of the blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little low on blue, and then it
completely cuts off some of that far red
[SPEAKER_00]: above 665.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we calibrate it according to
sunlight, or calibrate it according to
[SPEAKER_00]: electric light sources, and we have those
two different options available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we came out with the full spectrum
sensor, which more closely matches that
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR response, and so that one's going to
give you much more accurate readings for
[SPEAKER_00]: all light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the SQ100 series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one, the SQ110 is calibrated for
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SQ120 is calibrated for electric
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric lights meaning your high pressure
sodium, your metal halides, your T5 cool
[SPEAKER_00]: light fluorescents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not great for red LEDs because of
that spectral range we talked about on the
[SPEAKER_00]: graph before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's self-powered, meaning you don't need
to add an additional power supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to hook it up to a
single-ended or direct differential
[SPEAKER_00]: reading on your logger, and it will give
you an output from 0 to 800 millivolts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that range is equal to 0 to 4,000
micromoles, and so our factor for every
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor we send out is 5 micromoles per
meter squared per second per millivolt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's for the SQ110 and 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that link right there,
it's the same link as the page before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our SQ200 series, and this just takes that
same sensor and amplifies them into a
[SPEAKER_00]: voltage that you can use on your logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 212 and 222, 0 to 2.5 volts,
215 to 225, 0 to 5 volts, and 214 to 224,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 to 20 milliamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the same thing, the 210s are for
sunlight, the 220 is for electric lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to mention, same thing,
these all need to be powered in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that amplified output, so it needs
between 5 and 24 volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you have in there, if you have 12
volts, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will automatically regulate the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then give the output accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just some of your
applications that you might be using these
[SPEAKER_00]: for, greenhouse nursery, growth chambers,
under canopies, aquariums, freshwater and
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean, underwater environments,
and any measurements with your traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights, as we mentioned before,
metal halide, T5s, high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SQ300 has the same sensor as the 100
and 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just put it in the light bar so you can
get your spatial averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 310 is for sunlight, the 320 is for
electric, and then you can kind of see the
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 313 and 323 is 3 sensors, spaced over
50 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 316 and 326 is 6 sensors, over 50
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 311 and 321 is 10 sensors,
spaced over 70 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, use it under canopy to see
how much light is filtering through,
[SPEAKER_00]: given that spatial average, or on a bench,
or pretty much anywhere if you want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're just going to touch on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just been talking about the original
sensor, so the black line for the spectral
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to talk about the full
spectrum, the SQ500 series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually only have one sensor in
this series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the SQ500.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has that wider spectral range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The signal itself is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only 0 to 40 millivolts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that puts 100 micromoles per meter
squared per second per millivolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure your data logger or whatever
you're using to read this can read that
[SPEAKER_00]: small signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the output range is the same,
0 to 4,000 micromoles per meter squared
[SPEAKER_00]: per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accurate with all light sources,
including all LEDs, to give you those
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate PAR readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, you can see just a couple of
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that was on there before,
but especially with all LED lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: even those narrow bands, it's going to
give you accurate PAR readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this table shows you is how each
sensor measures up to the next one or
[SPEAKER_00]: compares with the one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, let's just go across the output
here for the sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see 0.2 millivolts per micromole
per meter squared per second for the 110
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: One millivolt per micromole per meter
squared per second for the 212 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 222.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the 214 and 224, you can see this is
per milliamp per micromole per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared per second, and that's 0.0064.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 215 and 225 is 2 millivolts
per micromole per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 300 is the same as the 100,
where it's 0.2 millivolt per micromole per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 500, that really small
signal, 0.01 millivolt per micromole per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can pull this up on the website and
look at it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if the specs meet what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SQ420 and SQ520 both have a USB
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 400 being the original series,
the 520 being the full spectrum series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require a computer or tablet to
display the output, but one of the really
[SPEAKER_00]: neat things here is you can set it up on
the computer, sampling interval,
[SPEAKER_00]: logging interval, unplug it from your
computer, and then take it and set it up
[SPEAKER_00]: in this type of application where you're
just powering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to log those readings that
you set up in the head up to 10,000 of
[SPEAKER_00]: those measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time you plug it into your
computer, you'll be able to take those
[SPEAKER_00]: readings in a CSV file and analyze it and
look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to mention that this is
written in an open software.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're some sort of system
integrator or someone who would just like
[SPEAKER_00]: the command codes to integrate it into
your own software, just email us at
[SPEAKER_00]: techsupport and we'll work with you on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of what the Apogee
Connect software looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our instantaneous reading
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see our reading here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just logging it right on the
computer, doing five second increments
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see where it's being saved
right here in a CSV file.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a couple of applications just
going back through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our sensors here in a
greenhouse, where you might use them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the LEDs where they might be used,
out in the field as far as a line quantum.
