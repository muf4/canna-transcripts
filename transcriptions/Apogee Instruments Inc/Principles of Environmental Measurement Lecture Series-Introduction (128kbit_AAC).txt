[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Beng Omali.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an application scientist at ICT
International.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to meet Professor Bruce Bugby
and Chief Scientist Mark Blonquist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using Apogee instruments for a
long time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to meet them and learn more
about their instrument is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Bruce Bugby, Professor of Crop
Physiology at Utah State University and
[SPEAKER_03]: President of Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here at the Hawkesbury Institute for
the Environment at Western Sydney
[SPEAKER_03]: University to do an all-day workshop on
principles of environmental measurements.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done some workshops together before,
but this is the first in Australia and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're thrilled to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This country is coming into spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: As part of that, we want to talk about a
couple instruments that we have been
[SPEAKER_03]: working on for several years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're introducing these instruments in
this workshop.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is a spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's small, compact, rugged.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's made for continuous monitoring
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like any spectroradiometer, it can be
mounted this way and a second one can be
[SPEAKER_03]: mounted down so you get reflectance
signatures from plant canopies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is small and lightweight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be flown on a drone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been working on this for several
years and we're excited to be introducing
[SPEAKER_03]: it at this workshop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow, the videos will show in detail
the characteristics of this sensor and
[SPEAKER_03]: what it can do in applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm holding a net radiometer like the
spectroradiometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been developing this one for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The design goals when we started were to
build a small, compact, lightweight
[SPEAKER_02]: instrument to facilitate mounting.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, we wanted to build a
four-component instrument that was lower
[SPEAKER_02]: cost but still performed.
[SPEAKER_02]: With regards to accuracy, compared wells
and favorably to the four-component
[SPEAKER_02]: instruments already on the market,
a couple of the design features.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the signals come into a central
analog to digital converter.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the signals are output as SDI-12 so
it doesn't use a number of data logger
[SPEAKER_02]: channels in order to make the measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, each individual sensor has a heater
to try to keep dew and frost off of the
[SPEAKER_02]: detectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And facilitate accurate measurements in
all conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Bruce said, we're happy to be here in
Australia to teach the workshop and
[SPEAKER_02]: discuss these new instruments as part of
our time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a few of the participants in this
workshop are PhD candidates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a workshop for scientists
looking for new technologies in emerging
[SPEAKER_03]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Dr Peter Colt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Director of ICT International.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're proud to be the distributors of
Apogee instruments in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regard to the principles of
environmental measurement, this is truly
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting because these principles are
really very important things to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: because they enable you to deploy the
instruments in the right way, collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: right data and provide the correct data
and interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really very important.
Thank you.
Thank you.
