[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, when measuring air
temperature and humidity in remote
[SPEAKER_00]: locations, researchers have always had to
sacrifice accuracy to conserve power,
[SPEAKER_00]: using naturally aspirated radiation
shields that can produce temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: errors up to 3 degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: To solve this problem, Apogee Instruments
proudly introduces the TS-100 Low Power
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspirated Radiation Shield, representing a
breakthrough in design and performance by
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding the same consistent and accurate
measurements as the best aspirated shields
[SPEAKER_00]: on the market, while drawing only 80 mA
and as low as 28 mA on low power mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the design.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internal variable speed fan uses pulse
width modulation and can be configured to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce power usage in certain weather
conditions, while the shield body features
[SPEAKER_00]: a Kiwanda inlet and Venturi contour to
enhance airflow allowing accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements in both strong winds and
still air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the shield is manufactured in a
high precision injection molding process
[SPEAKER_00]: using G-Loy plastic, which offers low
thermal conductivity, maximum weather
[SPEAKER_00]: durability, and a glossy white finish for
high reflectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The TS-100 is compact, lightweight,
and rugged, allowing for easy and extended
[SPEAKER_00]: deployment in the harshest of climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: For measurements right out of the box,
every shield comes standard with a
[SPEAKER_00]: precision thermistor and is designed to
accommodate PRTs and humidity probes if
[SPEAKER_00]: desired.

Aspirated Radiation Shield, visit us on
