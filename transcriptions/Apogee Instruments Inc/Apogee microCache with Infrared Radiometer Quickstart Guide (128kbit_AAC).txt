[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith and I do
technical sales and support here at Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're going to talk about the
Quick Start Guide for the AT100 MicroCache
[SPEAKER_00]: with our IRR sensors, our infrared
radiometers that are good for measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video, we're going to cover
where to download the app from,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to connect to the unit, configuring
your sensor, and then how to set up
[SPEAKER_00]: logging, and then how to get those logged
values off of your sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, this is where you will find
the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available in the Google Play Store
and then the iOS App Store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just type in Apogee Connect and
that is the icon you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are some screenshots that we're
going to be going through later on the
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is the Quick Start Guide on how
to connect to it and how to add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through each one of
these steps individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is here for a reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause the video as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one is the Quick Start Guide to
begin logging, how to set up the logging
[SPEAKER_00]: intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can pause here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the Quick Start Guide to
collecting the logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you've set it up for logging and
then you go back to it, how do you get
[SPEAKER_00]: those logs off so you can view them on
your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the steps there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to go through each one of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is an iOS version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what it's going to look like
when you first come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has Add Device right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our unit, MicroCache here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our IR sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I actually already have one added on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it would look like if you
had one added and it's not connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have one at all,
then this is what it's going to look like
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are going to go ahead and add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we do this is we're going to
push the green button here until it blinks
[SPEAKER_00]: blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's blinking blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the app's not looking for it yet,
so we have to hit the plus button.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit the plus button right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes up and it says UC 1074.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look back here and see that is
the correct one, serial number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for convenience, I'm going to add
this quick platform there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, we'll go ahead and add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see it comes up as an app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an SP 110, which is incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this is an SI 121.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look at our cal sheet that came
with the unit to know which model we're
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting, which one we had bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we choose model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we actually, it just is any,
whether it's an SI 111, 121, 131,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 1H1, we just do the SI-1XX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we click there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, it's asking us for the MCO
efficiency and the BCO efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we can see over here on our sheet,
this top row and this bottom row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really, as you can see,
these are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just written in different
multiples of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll go ahead and just do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: See our basic model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for the C2, it says we need,
so we'll hit clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll do 2, 0, 1, 0, 1,
5.
[SPEAKER_00]: C1, we hit clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, 9, 2,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 0, 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one, CO, clear that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 6, 0,
0, 0, 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come down here to C2, clear that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the B coefficients of C2,
so we have 1, 6, 8, 9, .7.
[SPEAKER_00]: C1, clear that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, 6, 2, 9, 0, 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right here, we'll hit clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we need a negative, so on iOS,
I just hit the negative button right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 1, 8, 6, 8, 3, 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I hit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I want to give it a name as well,
and we can just name it, right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just name it desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so we know what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we see that it's at a desk,
and we see that it's giving us some values
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, when it said 24.1, that means it
had not loaded the calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: coefficients, but now it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we went back out to that screen,
now it's finally updated, saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, we're calculating those values based
off what you input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, let's go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is our home screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, logs available for collection,
2,300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in our case, we don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That must have been previous, so we'll
clear that out.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear that to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, down here, these values will not
update until we get log data in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can tell that we don't have any
log data saved to the app to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that is why it says January 1st,
1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to live meter mode first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we go to live meter mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can get our dynamic graph here
that is changing.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this, again, we're just in
here in our studio, and we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: our temperature and our surface
temperature are about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I put my hand in front of the unit
here, so now we're measuring my outside
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of my hand, we can see that
it's somewhere around 27 to 28 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can change that, and the graph is
going to change accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the sensor body is nearly
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's very small changes,
but obviously just being closer to that
[SPEAKER_00]: did increase that sensor body temperature
a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the important thing about these
graphs is it is not logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just live data right now since we
came in and pushed live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go out of this, and I go back here,
and then I go back to live meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now it is logging again,
just giving us our spot measurements at
[SPEAKER_00]: our current location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it will just dynamically change
with that, and we can see those graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we want to record individual
points, this comes down here, and we just
[SPEAKER_00]: hit record current value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it did a time date, and then it gave
us our surface temperature, and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us our sensor body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we want to record value here,
we can see that surface temperature sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: body temperature, and we just hit
recording values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we want to export data,
we hit export.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes up with the line item of each
one, and then we just hit that familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: button up there, which is the share
button, which will allow us to just attach
[SPEAKER_00]: that straight to an email and email that
to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is live meter mode, perfect to
verify that our coefficients are in,
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect to see spot measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now currently, it is updating that
averaging every second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we wanted to go five seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we go back to home here,
and then we click on settings,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to go through each
one of these settings, but first one,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's look at live data averaging,
which is about third one down here on
[SPEAKER_00]: settings as we scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says averaging samples over one
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we move this over to five,
and it can go as high as 30 seconds,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we go to five, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come back here to live meter,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now it's doing five second averaging
to get all the way up there to that 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it was increasing because,
but it was still doing, it still takes the
[SPEAKER_00]: five seconds averaging before it got up
there to the 28, and we'll see that slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: fall off as well, just based on the five
second averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is live meter mode, and again,
it's giving us those same values that we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: see in live meter right up here under
current reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's go through settings now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just in case you wonder if you
entered your coefficients wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that was a lot of numbers,
they are always available right here under
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can pull up your sheet and double
check yourself any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if for any reason you lose your cal
sheet, just email us at techsupport at
[SPEAKER_00]: apogeeinstruments.com, and we can email
this information over to you, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: re-enter it into your microcache.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, everything looks good there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logging enabled is turned off currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to that and turn that on
and set that up in a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about live data averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some points here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The battery level says 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, do not trust that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email us at techsupport if you
have any questions about your battery
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardware and firmware version.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then match current time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what you want is you want the time on
your phone to match the time on your
[SPEAKER_00]: logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you just hit match current time,
and then it goes through, and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sure that those two sync up
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, down here is update sensor firmware.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good idea when it's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you go ahead and click this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have the latest, it's not
going to hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right now it says version on device is
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't update to version five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you can't see that because it's
very light on that screen, but you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: that on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I hit start, then down here you can
see that it's going through some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's going through the bootloader.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uploading the current version of
firmware here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to come down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you'll notice it's not complete until
the start button goes green because that
[SPEAKER_00]: means it reconnected to it again after it
had reset itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are all set on the firmware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's your basic rundown on settings,
dark threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't affect IR readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then notify when full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that so that once those
400,000 data points have been filled and
[SPEAKER_00]: you log in and connect to it, it will give
you that notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can turn that on as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, logging enabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we want to set this up so that it can
log.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the quick start instructions,
as we said, we recommend 15 minute log
[SPEAKER_00]: times so you can get your six to nine
month battery life out of the microcache.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do less than that, then it's going
to shorten it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go as short as minutes,
then you will reduce the life down to
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to one second, it may be one
week long as all the battery will last on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, make sure as you're setting up your
logging interval and your sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: intervals that you're aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, we just have this one set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go out to one minute and I'm
going to go logging interval 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, get this on one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this down to 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's going to average 12 samples to
average and then it's going to log that
[SPEAKER_00]: average every 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, until I hit save, it is not enabled
and then once I hit save, it has now saved
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it is now logging internally in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our logging is all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we come back here, it says zero for
collection because it is waiting to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that every minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, then we deploy it to set it up
wherever we want and then let's come back
[SPEAKER_00]: in an hour or two hours, whatever our plan
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to collect the logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we go right here to collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be on create new because
this is the first time we're getting our
[SPEAKER_00]: logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can set the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can set it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's do June 2020 or you can set to
the date, whatever you want.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we set the start time
[SPEAKER_00]: to, okay, set time to the beginning and
then if we click logs up to today,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will say logs remaining 65,000 because
from since this sensor has been used,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are 65,000 logs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's going to go through and download
each one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's going to take quite a while
and then it will graph it down here below
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it will graph it down here below
and you'll be able to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll go ahead and we're going to set
that one aside and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at this one on how to append logs and
what log data would actually look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right here, we have it here in front
of us.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see it's a road temp in the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we want to do is we want to
connect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're going to push the button down
until it blinks blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ready for it and instead it
connected right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we see right here, we have our two
data points here, our target temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and our sensor body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go into it, okay, and it says logs
available for collection is one.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we actually, so if we go to collect
logs, now I know that there is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: week's worth of data on this where we were
measuring the temperature of just our
[SPEAKER_00]: walkway out front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I go start date, okay, and I go to
create new, okay, and I can data set five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's just say, so studio demo,
just to name it something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the start time, let's go back
a week, okay, to Thursday and then end
[SPEAKER_00]: time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I want to hit and then I hit collect
logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that they collect logs,
collect, start time, create new,
[SPEAKER_00]: go back a week, Thursday, let's do
midnight to
[SPEAKER_00]: today, collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it is saying that the only data it has
is three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the data that I was looking for is no
longer, was erased off before the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, we have our data points
from the last three days as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: data point that had logged in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anytime we want to get new data
points, we just hit collect logs,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure it's on a pen to existing,
and then we'll collect logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says there are currently zero available
to log.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down here, we can see our sensor
body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we want to export that data,
we go to view data, we click here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we can go ahead and get those
data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that concludes our quick start guide
for the IR sensor with the Microcache.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, just email us
at techsport at aptginstruments.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
