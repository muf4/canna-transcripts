[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, and welcome to this video brought
to you by Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Nick Hold, and I'm an engineer
here at Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm here to talk to you about
one of our most recently released
[SPEAKER_00]: products, the AL120.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the AL120 was brought about to replace
our old leveling system, consisting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mounting bracket and the leveling plate
sold as two separate items.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mounting bracket consisted of a
Swiss cheese array of holes, only six of
[SPEAKER_00]: which were used for actual mounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, the leveling plate consisted
of a combination of six screws,
[SPEAKER_00]: three being used for mounting and three
being used for leveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very, very tedious system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based off of feedback that we've
received over the years, we have immensely
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified this design to consist of three
holes for mounting and a fixed wave spring
[SPEAKER_00]: as a pivot point for easy leveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to talk to you about how
to assemble your AL120 and how to mount it
[SPEAKER_00]: to your weather station or your cross arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin, for best practices we
encourage that you mount your sensor to
[SPEAKER_00]: your leveling plate prior to assembling
your bracket and prior to mounting it to
[SPEAKER_00]: your weather station.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you need to remove your sensor
for calibration or for any other purpose,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can always do so by unscrewing the
black nylon screw through the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: your bracket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin, using the three hole pattern
on your leveling plate, match it up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the three hole pattern on your leveling
bracket, fitting the wave spring into the
[SPEAKER_00]: groove on the back of the leveling plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your hex cap screws and fit them
through your leveling plate and begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: thread them into your bracket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have loosely finger tightened
these, grab your U-bolt and place it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the V-block on the bottom of your
bracket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And begin installing the hardware,
beginning with your watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've installed all this hardware,
tighten down your bronze nuts
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately to where your cross arm will
fit between the U-bolt and the V-block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can slide this right on to your
cross arm and finger tighten your hardware
[SPEAKER_00]: until it fits loosely on your cross arm
and approximately parallel to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take a half inch crescent wrench and
further tighten this down so that it fits
[SPEAKER_00]: firmly and snugly to your cross arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few turns, you should have it in
place.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now our AL120 is mounted on a
horizontal cross arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we do have a vertical
configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need to do to change it from
horizontal to vertical is remove the screw
[SPEAKER_00]: that holds the plastic V-block to the
bracket and move it to this back side,
[SPEAKER_00]: screwing in the screw from the inside,
inner side of the bracket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you've placed that on,
you follow the same steps to placing your
[SPEAKER_00]: U-bolt in your hardware and mount it to
your vertical cross arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a video, a tutorial of how
to assemble your AL120.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any questions or concerns concerning
this product, please call Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
Bye.
All right.
