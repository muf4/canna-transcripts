[SPEAKER_02]: All right, looks like we're all rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee has been a leader in affordable
environmental measurement tools for 28
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that time, we've learned a lot
about creating amazing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work tirelessly developing accurate
sensors, and we've designed rugged
[SPEAKER_00]: housings, perfected the lenses,
and engineered multiple ways to make our
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors as accurate as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often find ourselves asking,
though, how do we take our sensors to that
[SPEAKER_00]: next level of quality, that next level of
accuracy?
[SPEAKER_00]: From extensive research, we feel that that
next level of accuracy will not come from
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in our devices, but rather how we
can adapt our devices to control their
[SPEAKER_00]: external environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our radiation sensors spend years in the
field with little to no human intervention
[SPEAKER_01]: through the measurement process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through years of detailed study,
we found our greatest measurement
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge comes from essentially
biological sources, sources outside of our
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to prevent excessive,
shall we say, buildup on our radiation
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors, we needed to find a way to deter
avian species or birds from releasing
[SPEAKER_01]: their payload onto the measurement
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took a lot of time, but we
developed the perfect solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Introducing the latest in a long line of
environmental monitoring innovations from
[SPEAKER_02]: Apogee instruments, the Apogee PAR
Peepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Apogee PAR Peepers are an
industry-leading animal deterrent that
[SPEAKER_02]: reduces errors as a result of animal
interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PAR Peepers require no additional
power and can be mounted on all Apogee
[SPEAKER_02]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PAR Peepers use the innovative
ScareTactic avian repellent equipment
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stare technology utilizes non-violent
means to keep the birds away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Utilizing a bird's natural instinctive
fears of natural predators to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: birds away from your sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through a challenging and iterative
research process, we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine the ideal pupil-to-iris ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too small, and the deterrent was
ineffective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too large, and it became excessively
adorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took some time and effort, but we were
able to get it precise and accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: By keeping the birds away from your
sensors, you can have confidence in your
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And confident measurements is what we're
all about.
