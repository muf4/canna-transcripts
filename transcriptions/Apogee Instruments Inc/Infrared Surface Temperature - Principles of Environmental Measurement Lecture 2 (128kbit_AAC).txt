[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about surface
temperature measurements using infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions while I'm
talking feel free to raise your hand and
[SPEAKER_00]: ask and I'll do my best to address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have lots of slides unlike Bruce so
we're going to shift technologies just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface temperature can be a very
important variable in lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about it more in
relation to plants today but bear in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can use infrared technology to
measure soil surface temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: snow surface temperatures, roadways if
you're interested in road conditions for
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three key components to an infrared
radiometer are listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a radiation detector,
you have to have an internal temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor, and then you have to have a
housing to contain the two and be rugged
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it's stable in changing
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic operation is as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know from physics that all objects
that have a temperature above absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: zero emit infrared radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you point the sensor at is going
to be emitting infrared radiation towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case it's a plant canopy and the
sensor itself has the temperature above
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute zero so it's also going to be
emitting radiation back out so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: The signal that's actually measured by the
radiation detector inside the radiometer
[SPEAKER_00]: is proportional on this difference between
the absorbed radiation that's coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface that you're pointing it at and
the emitted radiation from the detector
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those signals can be quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of a common infrared radiometer
output 60 microvolts that's 0.06
[SPEAKER_00]: millivolts per degree C difference between
the target that you're looking at and the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the sensor itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is if you're making an
analog measurement of this, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring the voltage directly,
you need a high resolution voltmeter in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to measure that small signal and to
get an accurate number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listed here about one microvolt is
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a high-end data logger or
voltmeter to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the absorbed radiation, the amount of
radiation coming in is less than the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of radiation going out,
then the radiation balance at the detector
[SPEAKER_00]: itself is negative and you'll get a
negative voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite is true when you have more
radiation coming in than what's going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiation balance at the detector is
positive and you'll get a positive voltage
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than a negative voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to needing a voltmeter that
can measure small signals in the microvolt
[SPEAKER_00]: range, you also need one that can measure
polarity both positive and negative
[SPEAKER_00]: voltages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a minute ago that we all
remember from physics, radiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature are closely linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: All objects with a temperature above
absolute zero emit radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual equation that quantifies the
relationship between the two is called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stefan-Boltzmann equation, where the
energy emitted by an object in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a plant canopy, is equal to a
constant, that's the sigma, times the
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth power of the absolute temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're able to measure the radiation
being emitted or the energy being emitted
[SPEAKER_00]: by an object, then we can calculate the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basic premise for how these
infrared sensors work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important component of infrared
sensors that I didn't actually list on the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous slide is the filter that goes in
front of the radiation detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation detectors tend to be black
bodies, meaning they're good absorbers of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the wavelengths of radiation that are
incident on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we only want to measure the
wavelengths that are related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to build a radiometer that
measures what we're interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to put a filter in front of it to
give us just the wave lengths of radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A radiation detector should include a
filter that blocks all of the long wave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation that's outside of what we call
the atmospheric window.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmospheric window is the wavelengths
between 8 and 14 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a graph here that shows wavelength
on the x-axis from 5 to 20 micron and then
[SPEAKER_00]: transmittance of the atmosphere on the
y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we choose 8 to 14 micron is
that's the wavelength range that's called
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmospheric window.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially the wavelengths where the
atmosphere is transparent to long wave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, if you point a sensor with a
filter that has an 8 to 14 micron window
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, that radiation is going to come
through the atmosphere rather than be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water vapor and CO2 in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the wavelengths where the sensor
sees through the atmosphere, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below 8 micron, there's lots of absorption
by water vapor molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above 14 micron, there's lots of
absorption by carbon dioxide molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to measure the surface
ratio of radiation and not the atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we need a filter that matches
the atmospheric window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea of calibration,
I got a couple quick pictures right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the calibration system that we
use at Apogee Instruments to calibrate
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of these things commercially
available and we're going to let you play
[SPEAKER_00]: around with some of these handheld devices
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get models like this really
cheaply at the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You point them at the surface that you
want, you pull the trigger and it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just measured the temperature of the
floor as 71 Fahrenheit, or if we convert
[SPEAKER_00]: it to Celsius, about 22 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are fine, especially for
demonstration purposes or just spot checks
[SPEAKER_00]: where high accuracy isn't required.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference between something like
this that you can buy at the hardware
[SPEAKER_00]: store for a few dollars and something like
this that we manufacture at Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments is really the calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like this, the accuracy is
probably 1 to 2 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm just showing the sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The uncertainty of the calibration is
about 0.2 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an order of magnitude difference
between the accuracy of something like
[SPEAKER_00]: this and a research grade instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're looking at here is actually a
two component system and it's kind of hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to see it, but in the next slide I think
it will become clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this cap piece that sits on top of
a large piece of aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The piece of aluminum has a big hole in it
shaped like a cone and that's painted flat
[SPEAKER_00]: black.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that as the black body radiation
source that we can fine tune the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and get specific values of
temperature independent of the sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cap piece is another block of
aluminum that has a bunch of holes in it
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can slide the sensors into and
then independently control their
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have is a target or the black
body cone and a cap that fit together,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can independently control the
temperatures of the two and set this
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature at one value and the sensors
at a different value and derive a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: set of data that allows us to get sensor
specific calibration coefficients for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fine tune it to 0.2 C uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea, there's the
actual calibration device with the cap
[SPEAKER_00]: piece pulled off of it so you can see that
it's a black body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another one, a small one that we'll
use for a really brief demonstration
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called a Leslie Cube or if you
look it up on the internet sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called Professor Leslie's Cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who Professor Leslie is but
I'd like to meet him someday because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a really simple and powerful device that
we'll use in a few minutes to illustrate
[SPEAKER_00]: the concept of emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what you're looking at here
and what you're looking at here are
[SPEAKER_00]: similar devices that you can use to
calculate and calibrate the instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have a functional sensor that's
calibrated and you take it to the field to
[SPEAKER_00]: make measurements, it's not just a simple
matter of putting the sensor out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: recording the temperature that it gives
you and accepting that as the true value
[SPEAKER_00]: of surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have to correct for emissivity
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity is just a fraction of black
body emittance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like this black body cone here,
the black body cone that I showed you on
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous slide, they have very high
emissivities, well over 0.99, meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: they're almost black bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: A black body is a perfect emitter,
meaning it emits all of the theoretically
[SPEAKER_00]: possible radiation for its temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that has an emissivity less than
one is often called a gray body and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically it's not a perfect emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning it emits some fraction of
radiation less than it otherwise would if
[SPEAKER_00]: it were a black body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity is how we quantify the fraction
of black body emittance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a surface with an emissivity
of one, for example, the only radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the surface that arrives at
the sensor is radiation that was emitted
[SPEAKER_00]: by the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a surface that's not a
black body, so the emissivity is less than
[SPEAKER_00]: one, here we'll say 0.98, which is a
pretty good estimate of emissivity for a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means most of the radiation incident
on the detector is coming from the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest, but there's actually a small
fraction of radiation coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: background and if it's outside the
background is the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a small fraction of radiation
incident at the surface that's coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is that the long wave
reflection at the surface is one minus the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if our emissivity is 0.98, that means
our reflection of long wave is 0.02.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially you have 98% of your radiation
is coming from the plants which we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to measure and 2% is coming from
the background or the sky because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: being reflected off of the plant surface
towards the radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might ask yourself, why is that a big
deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the plant temperature and sky
temperature might not be the same number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are the same number, if they're
close to the same number, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter if you're reflecting a small
fraction of the sky radiation towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor, it's similar to the plant canopy
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the sky temperature is
significantly different, it can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can correct for this effect with a
relatively simple equation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: equations listed up here, I won't go
through the derivation, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that you need to go into the
equation to correct for emissivity are the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual measured temperature itself which
we get from the sensor, but then you need
[SPEAKER_00]: some measurement or estimate of the
background temperature and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement or estimate of the surface
emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see once we have those numbers,
they go in the equation here and give us
[SPEAKER_00]: an estimate of the true surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just by way of example, on a clear day,
the background temperature, and again if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're outdoors this is the sky,
can be really cold in the 8 to 14
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelength range that the temperature
sensor is measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might measure a surface temperature
of a plant canopy of 25 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clear day, the sky temperature is
negative 40 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our plant canopy emissivity is 0.98,
our actual surface temperature is at about
[SPEAKER_00]: a degree higher, close to 26 Celsius than
the measured temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So emissivity can have a big impact on
temperature measurements and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important that we account for it if our
application requires accuracy better than
[SPEAKER_00]: a degree Celsius or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you another example,
on a cloudy day, we'll assume again a
[SPEAKER_00]: measured temperature of 25 Celsius,
but on a cloudy day the sky temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't nearly as cold as it is on a clear
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 Celsius is a much better estimate of
background temperature on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again assuming a plant canopy temperature
of 0.98, now the surface temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the true surface temperature, is only
about 0.2 Celsius above what our sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: gave us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the emissivity effect will vary with
the sky conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear, sky is cold, cloudy, the sky is
warm, and when we get a break we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually walk outside with some of these
low-cost handheld infrared sensors and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can point them up and measure the
temperature of the sky and measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the surface and get a feel
for how big the differences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so this table just shows a
handful of emissivity values for
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental surfaces and some man-made
surfaces, concrete and polished aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately most of the surfaces that
we're interested in measuring,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like plant leaves and plant
canopies, soil, water, they're close to
[SPEAKER_00]: black bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite because none of them have an
emissivity of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep plant canopies that have a lot of
leaves can be really close to black
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies, 0.99 in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the emissivity effect tends to be small
in environmental applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again it can be quite important,
especially if we have clear sky
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just gives you an idea of
background temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear sky will be very cold, overcast sky
will be near air temperature, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a simple equation that we derived in
Logan, Utah that you can use to estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: the background temperature or the sky
temperature in the 8 to 14 micron range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take the air temperature and you
add 50 times the fraction of clouds and
[SPEAKER_00]: then subtract 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fraction of clouds is basically
what percentage of the hemisphere of sky
[SPEAKER_00]: is cloud cover and what percentage is
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's take a quick break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about maybe halfway through and we
have a break for tea time in just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask if James would go fill
our little Leslie cube full of hot water
[SPEAKER_00]: and just show you the emissivity effect in
real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put it in right there, fill it all
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we're going to do is I have a
couple infrared sensors here and when we
[SPEAKER_00]: take a break you're welcome to play around
with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really simple, power button and
then you point it at what you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure and it outputs the temperature on
the screen in Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example if I pointed at the ceiling
and we get around 22 Celsius, I pointed at
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor, we get about the same number
and that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room here is essentially the same
temperature and so the surfaces in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room should be about the same temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we're going to do is measure the
black body surface of the Leslie cube and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the side of the Leslie cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a look at these numbers for a
second and I can tell you the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Leslie cube, it's polished stainless
steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So polished aluminum has an emissivity of
around 0.03 to 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polished stainless steel will be something
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact number but it will
be something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're going to do is fill the the
Leslie cube full of hot water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the black body cone of the
Leslie cube is close to a black body so
[SPEAKER_00]: its emissivity is very near one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any ideas what the temperature of the
black body cone will be versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel side of the Leslie cube if
we measure it with one of these sensors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just assume the water temperature
will be 50 or 60 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what should the black body cone surface
temperature be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it should be close to the true
temperature because it's a black body
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning it's emitting the maximum amount
of radiation it should emit for that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about if we pointed at the side of
the the Leslie cube and measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: polished aluminum surface, what should the
temperature be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why 22?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should see a temperature that's pretty
close to the room temperature because
[SPEAKER_00]: remember one minus the emissivity is the
long-wave reflectivity and so let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: assume that the emissivity of this flat
side is 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means 95% of the radiation that we're
measuring should be reflected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should see something that's maybe
about 22 Celsius because the ceiling and
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor were about 22 when we measured
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll turn it on and I don't know how
well you can see the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll yell out the numbers for those of you
that can't see the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we pointed at the the black body
surface and the unit actually does some
[SPEAKER_00]: averaging and so it's up to temperature
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's about 38.6 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I pointed at the panel on the side
we're getting about 26 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not quite as cold as the 22 that I
measured on the floor and that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: because the emissivity is actually a
little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the emissivity is like 0.1 or 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're actually doing is getting an
average temperature somewhere between the
[SPEAKER_00]: true temperature and the room temperature
because the emissivity is somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 0 and 1 and I don't know exactly
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an excellent question because
you're actually jumping ahead in my
[SPEAKER_00]: slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I'm going to talk about in
my slideshow is the field of view and so
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens is if we put it right up next
to the the black body we should measure
[SPEAKER_00]: something around 38 and again we are about
38.6 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I slowly start to move it away in the
front row what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting colder and colder so now
we're about probably 12 centimeters maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 centimeters away and we're reading 30
instead of 38.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening is we're moving it
further and further from the the black
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing more and more within the
footprint that this thing measures and so
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're starting to move it away and
we're seeing the the sides where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: polished aluminum in addition to the the
black body and that's determined by the
[SPEAKER_00]: the field of view of the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might actually be able to do another
demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I have a light in my bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, let me make a comment while you're
getting set up for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look on the internet for
manufacturers of infrared radiometers you
[SPEAKER_01]: will see some manufacturers that sell an
instrument with a dial on the back that is
[SPEAKER_01]: allegedly correct for emissivity and they
say this is a terrific feature our
[SPEAKER_01]: instruments more accurate because we dial
in emissivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do is take the reading and
multiply by the emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually they divide by the emissivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or divide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it often makes the measurement worse
instead of better because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: included including the reflected radiation
that Mark's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So boy does that confuse a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They act like it's just a simple dial you
can just correct for this and it drives
[SPEAKER_01]: people that know what they're doing crazy
because it confuses the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just take a dial and correct for
emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point Bruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have infrared radiometers that
have a dial on them that allow you to tune
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the emissivity of the surface I
would strongly recommend that you set that
[SPEAKER_00]: dial to one so that it doesn't make that
correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually it will make the correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take the measurement and it'll
divide it by one so you get the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement and then use the equation that
I gave you on the previous slide to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the emissivity correction the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if there's no more questions
about emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, we've got real problems with
emissivity down in Antarctica because our
[SPEAKER_02]: moss temperature is in the full Sun and it
can get up to 20 degrees Celsius and the
[SPEAKER_02]: air temperature is obviously much colder
than that and so if we use infrared
[SPEAKER_02]: sensors down there we're finding a low
degree of emissivity of accuracy and also
[SPEAKER_02]: the mosses the emissivity can change
according to their wet, dry, underwater,
[SPEAKER_02]: frozen, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any quick solution for correcting
for emissivity if the emissivity is
[SPEAKER_02]: changing over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the answer to that is you have to
actually characterize the emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know what it is within
whatever degrees of uncertainty you're
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with in order to use the
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to measure the
emissivity and if you want I can give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some direction regards to papers in the
literature that will describe how to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in order to use the equation to
correct for emissivity you have to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good handle on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get close by looking it up because
you look at water 0.96 to 0.98 Biological
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces are full of water and so they're
always in 0.96 to 0.98.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our skin is a high emissivity because
it's hydrated, it's full of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now sometimes it matters if it's 0.96 or
it's 0.98 but biological surfaces that are
[SPEAKER_01]: full of water are always a high emissivity
but still you can have significant errors
[SPEAKER_01]: if they don't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's because the moss temperature
is so different from the air temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: even a slight difference in emissivity can
drastically alter your measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: My examples only showed I had an example
for a clear sky and a cloudy sky but I
[SPEAKER_00]: could have just easily had an example for
clear sky with an emissivity of 0.98 and
[SPEAKER_00]: clear sky with an emissivity of 0.95 and
we could look at the error there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be an error as a function of
emissivity and so if you don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact emissivity you either have to live
with that uncertainty or you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the emissivity so you know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about field of view for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual area or the footprint that's
being measured by the radiometer will
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the field of view of the
radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the mounting height or the
distance of the radiometer from the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface that you're trying to measure and
the other one is the angle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometer whether it's looking straight
down or at an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field of view of the radiometer is
defined as the angle or the half angle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cone apex where the cone base is the
area surface being measured and the apex
[SPEAKER_00]: is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to illustrate this particular model
has a half angle field of view of 22
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees or a full angle field of view of
44 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way that I like to think of field
of view and the best way that I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: illustrate it is with a flashlight and
this is not necessarily a flashlight it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a pen with an LED on the end but I
think I can make it work for demonstration
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all familiar if we go into a dark
room and we hold the flashlight close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall and perpendicular to the wall we
get a small circle where it's pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity light right and then if we start
moving the flashlight away from the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: the circle gets bigger spreads out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we hold the pen or the flashlight next
to the wall and then we start to angle it
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's no longer perpendicular to the
wall the footprint or the spot on the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: it now spreads out into an ellipse rather
than a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field of view of a radiometer is
analogous to the the spot or the light dot
[SPEAKER_00]: that a flashlight makes on a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your radiometer is perpendicular to the
surface that you're trying to measure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a footprint of a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pretty close to the surface
you're trying to measure that's footprint
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be small.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you move the radiometer further from
the surface the footprint gets bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger meaning you're averaging more and
more of the ground area into the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature measurement just like when we
moved the flashlight away from the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: not only did the circle get bigger but it
got less and less intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your radiometer is perpendicular to the
surface you see a circle as soon as you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to angle it the footprint spreads
out into an ellipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the different field of view
options of infrared sensors that Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: builds and other companies that make
infrared radiometers are likely to have
[SPEAKER_00]: different fields of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three of them that have a circular
field of view just different angles that
[SPEAKER_00]: make the footprint either a little bit
smaller or a little bit larger and then
[SPEAKER_00]: this one has a horizontal field of view
this one's actually designed to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: row crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field of view is wide in this
dimension but narrow in this dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you orient it horizontally like this
with row crops looking that are running
[SPEAKER_00]: this way then you can try to minimize the
soil that is in the field of view and
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize the plant area that's in the
field of view using a horizontal field of
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: What often comes up is that's all well and
good I understand that putting it close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface gives me a small footprint and
moving it away from the surface gives me a
[SPEAKER_00]: big footprint but how do I actually attach
numbers to the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tool that you can find on the
Apogee Instruments webpage that allows you
[SPEAKER_00]: to calculate in dimensions of meters
squared how much land area am I going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if I have a sensor with this field of
view for example this height above the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface for example and this angle from
perpendicular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know three numbers in order to
to get a footprint calculation you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: know the the field of view of the
radiometer the height above the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've mounted your radiometer and
then the angle of the radiometer from
[SPEAKER_00]: perpendicular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you input those three numbers into
the calculator it will spit out meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared of ground area that you're going
to actually measure on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question that comes up often in
relation to field of view is what do I do
[SPEAKER_00]: in this situation where I have partial
canopy cover maybe it is row crops or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's a forest where the trees are
are fairly sparse and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the plant canopy temperature but
you have all of this soil that you see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple techniques and I won't spend
too much time on these one way that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can deal with this is angle the radiometer
to try to maximize the canopy within the
[SPEAKER_00]: field of view and so you can see if it's
looking straight down you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: something like you know half of the area
within the footprint is soil and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: half is plants but now if you angle it
most of what you see is in the in the area
[SPEAKER_00]: is plants you might still have a little
sliver of soil here that you see but by
[SPEAKER_00]: angling it you can try to get more plant
area and less soil area in the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another way that you can deal with this
is you can measure or estimate the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and then approximate the the
fractions of canopy and fraction of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that are within the field of view and you
can use a simple equation to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate the canopy temperature if you
know roughly what the fraction of canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: is and the fraction of soil is and the
soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inputs you need here are this is
the actual measured surface temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: from the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a measurement or estimate of
the soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the fraction of canopy in the
field of view and one minus that number is
[SPEAKER_00]: the fraction of soil within the field of
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have reasonable estimates of
soil temperature and then the fraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: field of view that's occupied by canopy
and soil you can try to estimate canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature from the data and eliminate
the soil temperature if canopy temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: is the number that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few more slides that deal with an
application of infrared measurements of
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature or we can take time
for tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see the application?
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll try to be brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a real quick summary of infrared
thermometry or infrared radiometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small signals require a high resolution
voltmeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's if you have an analog sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays a lot of sensors have analog to
digital converters on board the sensor and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they output digital signals like
SDI-12 or Modbus and so if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make surface temperature measurements,
but you don't have a way to measure these
[SPEAKER_00]: small voltages that doesn't mean you can't
make the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means you need to buy a version
that outputs a digital signal like Modbus
[SPEAKER_00]: or SDI-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emissivity correction is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent quite a bit of time on that one
and remember the radiometer averages
[SPEAKER_00]: everything within the field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have things within the field of
view that you don't want to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: you either have to reposition the sensor
to eliminate them from the field of view
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it's the case of plant canopies and
soil there's ways you can try to estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: one temperature if you know the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: To move on to the application really
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past we've often made still model
conductance measurements with these little
[SPEAKER_00]: handheld devices or sometimes they're not
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a full photosynthesis system from
Lycorp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may be familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a porometer from Dekagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow you to clamp on to leaves and
measure still model conductance and these
[SPEAKER_00]: are great instruments but all you get is
the still model conductance of a single
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf that you clamped on and you also
require as a person to be in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: with the instrument to make the
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few years ago myself and Bruce and
one of our colleagues set out to use
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared radiometers to try to measure
plant canopy still model conductance
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically using weather data and with the
addition of an infrared measurement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy temperature to estimate still model
conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't spend too much time here but
you're looking at a picture of the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: energy balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the equation over here are all the
equations necessary to describe the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface energy balance and the number that
we're interested in here is the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy still model conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without going into detail we can
rearrange all of the equations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: shown here for the surface and we can
solve for this number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is described in the paper on
this slide and if you're interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper I can easily send you a PDF of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we do that it gives us an
equation that calculates plant canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: still model conductance if we have these
measurements or estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have the canopy temperature,
air temperature, humidity, radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: wind speed and then some information about
the height of the plants and the leaf area
[SPEAKER_00]: index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the previous slide I was showing a
picture of one of our weather stations and
[SPEAKER_00]: so here's where we're getting all of our
weather data and then all of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you see here are the infrared
radiometers and these ones are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: a corn canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in Nebraska I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just show you some data where we
actually calculated still model
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance from the measurements that we
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're looking at here is canopy
still model conductance on the y-axis and
[SPEAKER_00]: then x-axis says day of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is day of year 195 through day of
year 206.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be roughly mid-july or right
in the middle of the summer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two lines on this still model
conductance graph here, a green line and a
[SPEAKER_00]: black line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green line is actually a model
calculation of canopy still model
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance and we're calling it potential
conductance and so what it is is an
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate of what we expect the canopy
still model conductance to be if the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are well watered and not stressed
and then the black line is our actual
[SPEAKER_00]: data, the canopy still model conductance
that we calculated from our weather
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements and our measurement of the
canopy temperature from the infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor and you can see these couple days
here the black line matches the green line
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well indicating the plants are well
watered because the calculated values of
[SPEAKER_00]: still model conductance are matching the
modeled values and again the modeled
[SPEAKER_00]: values give us what we expect the
theoretical value to be for well watered
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and then you can see for a few
days in a row the black line is well below
[SPEAKER_00]: the green line meaning the actual values
are well under the potential values
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating the plants are water stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over here it jumps back up again and
we have two or three days where the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: matches the potential pretty well before
it starts to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the same thing in this graph
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the ratio of the two so you
take the black line divided by the green
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're near one it means the two match,
if we're below one it means the black line
[SPEAKER_00]: is lower than the green line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any ideas what happened right here
where it jumps up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you can see it declines there,
mother nature irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got almost an inch of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cornfield that I showed was naturally
irrigated and when the rain fell it bumped
[SPEAKER_00]: back up like we would expect it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one application that you
could potentially pursue with infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can give you information about plant
canopy water status and plant response to
[SPEAKER_00]: their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at still model
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more graph this just shows a plot of
the potential value so a reference value
[SPEAKER_00]: on this axis and then the actual value our
calculated value on this axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the exact same experiment in
Nebraska in the United States and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're doing here is plotting the two
for the days immediately after rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: when we expect that our actual value
should match our modeled value and indeed
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the plants are well watered the
two numbers match so it indicates that our
[SPEAKER_00]: method of getting actual is working pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outliers are possibly when the canopy
was wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get data that don't necessarily
match the model if the leaf surfaces are
[SPEAKER_00]: wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have for still model
conductance for the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any questions about any of the
IR measurement details that we covered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions about this specific
application?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
