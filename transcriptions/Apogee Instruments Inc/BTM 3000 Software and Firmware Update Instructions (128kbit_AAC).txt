[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do technical sales and support here at
Apogee Instruments and we're here to do
[SPEAKER_00]: another frequently asked questions video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about the BTM
3000 update instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we have the BTM 3000 update
is we have switched the way we do the
[SPEAKER_00]: format on the software and the firmware
and so because of that, say for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: it did work on an old computer but then
you downloaded the latest BTM 3000 and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not working on your new computer then
you would need to do these firmware
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions to get it to work
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a few reasons why you might be
interested in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your sensor work on a different
computer and it's not working now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your sensor show connected but with
no serial number?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a few other small things in
there you may be able to pick up and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out why your sensor is not working
and we'll get it working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the original software
looked like, the original format,
[SPEAKER_00]: had your micro mole reading right there,
said biotech marine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it currently looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is what your screen shows with
your micro mole per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second reading here and you're showing
connected here, you're set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to worry about any sort of
firmware or software upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause or turn off the video now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If however, you're like everyone else,
you probably see something more like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're reading 0.0 here and you're
showing device not connected here or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're showing connected here but 0.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cover both of those issues by the
end of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go on though, I do need to
stress this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The firmware update has to happen on a PC
and it can't happen on a Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we've updated the firmware on
your sensor on a PC, you're good to go on
[SPEAKER_00]: a Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new software works great on a Mac but
you just can't upgrade the firmware on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to happen on a PC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friend, neighbor, whoever you need to
borrow a PC from to update it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be set to go on your own Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've done here is I've outlined all
the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the all-inclusive, troubleshooting
instructions for you to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put these up here and you can see I'm
scrolling through them fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just pause if you want to see
something and go back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also listed these instructions on
our website under the technical support
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just to give you something to
refer back to if for whatever reason the
[SPEAKER_00]: situations I go through don't match up
with yours perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come back to one of these steps
and it will answer for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and jump into our
demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blank screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the latest version of BTM
3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here an old sensor that has the
old firmware on it and it would work just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine on the old software but that's not
our example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our example is the latest software that we
need to upgrade the firmware on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we find it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Apigeeinstruments.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come across to the support tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we come down here to where it says
software downloads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll come over to biotech marine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our manual and then our two
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we're doing the firmware update
so we're on PC version.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll click there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pretty basic way for it to download
files here down here in the corner of our
[SPEAKER_00]: internet browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a few seconds for it to
get I think the file size is like 40
[SPEAKER_00]: megabytes or there about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that gets loaded there then we'll
click on it and go through the install
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our .exe file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open that up and then our install shield
is going to show up right here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty basic instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I accept the terms in the license
agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I want to install it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Program files x86 btm.
[SPEAKER_00]: install.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I'm okay installing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We click through these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a slightly older version of the
software it may not have come up with this
[SPEAKER_00]: launch driver installation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do want to make sure that's checked for
all the latest versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes we're okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we click right here we can see device
driver installation wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We click next.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's installing our drivers for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have the btm 3000 software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's open that up and see what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again this is probably why you're watching
the video because you've followed those
[SPEAKER_00]: steps and you've landed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing is let's just close the
software for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pull up our device manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple ways to do this through
control panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Windows 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just click down here and type in device
manager pops right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it says btm 3000 USB sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to recognize it but it has a
yellow dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our example this is what we're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to do is right click on him
and I am going to uninstall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to say are you sure you want to
delete the driver software for this
[SPEAKER_00]: device.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that's checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I click OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we open btm 3000 we can see it says
would you like to update your firmware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit OK and it comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if yours did not come up the first
time there have been instances where you
[SPEAKER_00]: just have to close out of the software and
then disconnect, reconnect your sensor and
[SPEAKER_00]: then open the software again.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason some computers take twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to this screen where it after
you it says would you like to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: firmware update and you click yes and you
click on USB quantum version 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct version is version 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few instances who need version
3 but you'll want to contact us if you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you're one of those cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone else it's version 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If once you have your sensor reading if
it's reading in the 5000 area it means you
[SPEAKER_00]: clicked version 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to just update your firmware to
version 2 and we can show you a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: those steps later on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we click version 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's firmware update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so it's asking us to reconnect the
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit OK and pull it apart
[SPEAKER_00]: and reconnect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we will notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again we're not showing any progress here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's close it and reopen the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to do the update now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said you may have to do it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to do it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let this come up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it do that firmware update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you'll notice that when it was done
correctly it says USB serial device COM3
[SPEAKER_00]: over here in device manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like to leave device manager
running in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so if we hit OK then it
automatically comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright please enter the serial number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know our serial number is 1166.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find that on the white tab right
here next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says BTM3000 1166.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Device connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serial number 1166.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so now for those of you who have
0.0 but your device is connected this step
[SPEAKER_00]: is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also on those pages before it said
important last step number 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we click here on the
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under multiplier we're in caps lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to type in factory and hit
enter and then it will allow us to
[SPEAKER_00]: overwrite permanent calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we hit 0.0 we can overwrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see it will allow you to update
firmware if for whatever reason you tried
[SPEAKER_00]: other steps and you couldn't update the
firmware but you can connect and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to update the firmware here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way to do it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I overwrite and then I click save.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give it a few seconds to load and then
it will begin reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're reading with our
lights in here is 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the steps to update the
firmware on your BTM3000 and to get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with the latest software.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions feel free to
email us or call us at tech support here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
