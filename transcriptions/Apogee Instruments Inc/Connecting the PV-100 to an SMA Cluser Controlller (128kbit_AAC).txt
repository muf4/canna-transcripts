[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith here at
Apogee Instruments, and today we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about how to wire up the ST-150
ambient air temperature sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CS-240 back of panel module
temperature sensor, and the TS-100
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirated radiation shield to the SMA
cluster controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these components are part of our
PV-100 monitoring package from Apogee
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments, which also includes the
pyranometer, the SP-214, which is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: a different wiring video and so if you're
looking for wiring instructions on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: just click on the comments below and then
you can find that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the CS-240,
and this is what the back of module
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature sensor looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there it's got a little bit of
adhesive, and then it will also come with
[SPEAKER_00]: some captain tape to be able to mount that
on the back of your panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wiring for this, it comes with
seven conductors here, two black,
[SPEAKER_00]: two red, two white, and a shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our application connecting to the SMA
cluster controller, we'll just go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: and bend down the black conductors,
because we don't need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to trim them off,
whatever your needs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start with the shield,
and we're going to be working on terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: X7 down here, and we're going to start on
row B, which is the bottom one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first terminal here is going to
be the shield, and then the next one is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the white conductor,
and it actually doesn't matter which white
[SPEAKER_00]: conductor, you can choose either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next one is going to be a red
conductor, and again it doesn't matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can choose either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can choose the other white
conductor that goes in the fourth one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the last one is the other red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the way we can check ourselves here is
if our cluster controller is powered up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can just push down until we get to
meteorology, and then we can see our
[SPEAKER_00]: second one says module temperature,
and it's giving us a reading right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it looks like an accurate reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that that is wired up
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to talk about the ST-150
ambient air temperature sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our Class A PRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just slide that back into the
TS-100 shield, there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do order the PV-100 package,
it will come already pre-glued into the
[SPEAKER_00]: port that goes in the side of the TS-100
shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one comes with five conductors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a shield, a red,
a black, a green, and a white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll just be using all five of these
conductors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're now on X7, row A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start right here,
and we're going to put the shield in
[SPEAKER_00]: first, in the first terminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is going to be the white
conductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next one is going to be the black
conductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the green conductor into the
fourth terminal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the red conductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, once that's all connected,
we can just scroll down here, and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see our ambient temperature, and it is
giving us a believable reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing we need to do today is
power the fan on our TS-100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really important to use an active
shield when you're taking these ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have on our other video,
the PV-100 video, some graphs that show
[SPEAKER_00]: the data we collected on active radiation
shields versus those passive shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to power the fan on this, it needs the
12-volt power supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Included in the PV-100 is this little DC
to DC converter that takes 24 volts DC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also already available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And converts it to 12 volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conductors from the TS-100,
there are seven of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bend down all but the red and the
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only need the red and the black for our
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So connected already to the converter is
the 24 volts powered off the 24-volt power
[SPEAKER_00]: supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will go ahead and the middle one
here, we will connect the black conductor
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the one on the end will be our
red to power up the 12 volts on the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we slide him in and tighten him
down, we can hear the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also feel the air coming off the
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know we're getting those accurate
ambient air temperature measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for watching how to
wire up the ST-150 ambient air temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor, the CS-240 back of the panel
module temperature sensor, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: powering the TS-100 aspirated radiation
shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, feel free to
leave them in the comments below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for watching.
See you next time.
