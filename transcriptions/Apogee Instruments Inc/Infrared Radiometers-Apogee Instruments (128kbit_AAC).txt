[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee instruments and infrared
radiometers are excellent for measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperatures and applications that
require extreme accuracy and zero
[SPEAKER_00]: interference to the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists use them in many ways,
such as monitoring plant canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures to detect water stress,
taking road surface readings in harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: climates, measuring water and snow
temperatures in hydrological studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: spot checking solar panel temperatures to
ensure efficiency, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to precision and durability,
Apogee sets the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each infrared radiometer has an
industry-leading uncertainty of 0.2C at a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of minus 30 to 65C, with a response
time of less than one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: To eliminate water vapor errors,
the sensor's unique germanium window
[SPEAKER_00]: matches the 8 to 14 micron atmospheric
window, and any emissivity errors are
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated by applying a correction
formula when measuring background
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, each sensor is housed in a sealed
aluminum body to provide years of reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: service in any environment, with a
radiation shield to protect from rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the final step of production,
each unit is custom calibrated and quality
[SPEAKER_00]: checked using a state-of-the-art
temperature chamber that puts each sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: through a 15-hour performance cycle before
it leaves the factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: For added flexibility, Apogee features
models with various half-angle fields of
[SPEAKER_00]: view, including 14 degrees, 18 degrees,
22 degrees, and our wide format 32 by 13
[SPEAKER_00]: degree model for measuring surfaces at
shallower angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maximize compatibility with data
loggers, each model is available in both
[SPEAKER_00]: an analog version with a microvolt output
and a digital SDI-12 option.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instantaneous readings, all sensors
are available with an integrated handheld
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.

of infrared radiometers, visit us on the
