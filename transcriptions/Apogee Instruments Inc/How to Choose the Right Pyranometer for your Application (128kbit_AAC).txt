[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith,
and we're going to talk about pyranometers
[SPEAKER_00]: from Apogee Instruments, choosing the
right sensor for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to cover today what the
pyranometers measure, the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between our different series, the 100,
200, 500 series, the output options for
[SPEAKER_00]: these sensors, what the SP420 is,
and then we're just going to list a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of common applications that people use our
pyranometers for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the pyranometer measures shortwave
radiation and it does it in units of watts
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also known as energy flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our sensors are calibrated to match
the spectrum response of high-end
[SPEAKER_00]: black-body thermopile pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link there to the traceability,
but what we want to show is what that
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the background, we have the
solar radiation spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the red and the black lines
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our SP100 and 200 series measure from
360 to 1120 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the spectral range is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spectral range of the thermopile
pyranometer is 385 to 2105.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the range that all of our
pyranometers, both the silicon cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: the black body, is from 285 to 2800
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we do that is we use these ISO
classified secondary standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are the standards that we
reference all of our pyranometers to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we send those ISO classified
pyranometers into the National Renewable
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy Laboratory to be calibrated there,
which then references back to the World
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiometric Reference in Davos,
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we're able to calibrate
our sensors that have a smaller spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: response to match the output of high-end
black-body thermopile pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the difference between the
thermopile pyranometer and the silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: cell pyranometer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's an excellent video put out
by my colleague, Mark Blonquist,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can click there, click up in the
corner, and you can watch that video,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's going to explain the advantages
of the thermopile pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to break it down simply, in clear sky
conditions, the silicon cell pyranometer
[SPEAKER_00]: works great and is going to give you very
accurate readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cloudy conditions and overcast
conditions, the thermopile pyranometer is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the best, most accurate sensor
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know about the shortcomings of
the silicon cell and are aware of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that one might be what's going to
work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in all applications, the thermopile is
going to give you that more accurate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down below is just a comparison
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that if you want to see
that on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also are going to have that same chart
on the video here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the SP100 series, this silicon
cell-based spectral response we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about, it's self-powered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that the output is between 0 and
350 millivolts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the SP230 has that same output
where it's self-powered, but it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: heater built in so that the rain,
the dew, the frost can be melt off with
[SPEAKER_00]: just a 12-volt input.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these sensors are interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP110 and the SP230.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have SP110s right now,
but you'd like the heated version,
[SPEAKER_00]: the SP230, you can just change those out
and they'll have the same calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: factor of 5 watts per meter squared per
millivolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP200 series has the same sensor as
the SP100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the amplified versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a 0 to 2.5 volt version,
0 to 5 volt version, and 4 to 20 milliamp
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those do require to be powered by 5 to 24
volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're interchangeable by type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an SP215 is going to have the same
calibration factor as another SP215.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP500 and SP600 series.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all thermopile sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger spectral response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're self-powered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have a smaller signal than our
other self-powered one, 0 to 114
[SPEAKER_00]: millivolts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Built-in heater in both sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each one does have an individual
calibration factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are not interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're interchangeable like the SP100 and
200 series.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you change the sensor, you do need to
change the calibration factor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is that chart I referenced
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause if you want to look at
something specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to go through and look at
the output and the model number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the SP110, there's a 0 to 350
millivolt output.
[SPEAKER_00]: SP110, 0 to 2.5 volt output.
[SPEAKER_00]: SP212, 4 to 20 milliamp output.
[SPEAKER_00]: SP214, 0 to 5 volt output.
[SPEAKER_00]: SP215, 0 to 350 millivolt with the heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: SP230.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the thermopile pyranometer,
the SP510, is the upward looking model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are the approximate
sensitivity on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP420 is the same silicon cell sensor
as the SP100 and SP200.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has a USB output so that it
connects straight to a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use the computer as the
logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it requires a computer or tablet to
display the output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also comes with the app that
you connect software is included when you
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase this sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what the software
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the instantaneous output here
just after you have the software
[SPEAKER_00]: downloaded and it's connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to do logging mode,
you just set up your logging sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logging interval, and then it will show
you the logging information over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where that logging information is
saved is right here in a CSV file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is fantastic for residential homes
if people want to put this up on their
[SPEAKER_00]: rooftop next to their solar panels and see
the amount of available solar radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what their solar panels are
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of common applications,
just what I just mentioned there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evapotranspiration calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the amount of solar radiation
being calculated for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather station solar irradiance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the amount of solar
radiation hitting a particular spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would use our SP510, SP610.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would help you calculate the
amount of available or the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: shortwave radiation coming in and the
amount of shortwave radiation leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to estimate the solar thermal
load on commercial building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some customers buy these and put
them inside windows to see what the solar
[SPEAKER_00]: load is on a particular room that's
covered with glass to see how that's
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting the temperature.
