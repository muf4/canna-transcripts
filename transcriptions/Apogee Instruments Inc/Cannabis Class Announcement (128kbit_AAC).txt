[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bruce Bugbee, President of Apogee
Instruments and also Professor of Crop
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm recording this video today here in
the Apogee recording studio to make an
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now teaching a class in the science
and technology of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is medical cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This class is the research result of years
of our research in my laboratory at Utah
[SPEAKER_00]: State University with my graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'm joined in teaching this class
by a couple of colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you a quick overview of the
class in this video and then the link so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can register for the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take the words in the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: For starters, the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on our research and
university research of our colleagues on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also based on our experience applying
the principles in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big greenhouse of cannabis with
one of our collaborating growers that's
[SPEAKER_00]: working with us on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The technology means applying the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means the principles that we learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we apply them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What technologies do we use to optimize
cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes this class unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a principles class that we
might teach graduate students at the
[SPEAKER_00]: university.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an applied class where we explain how
to apply the principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that combination that makes this
class truly unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about cannabinoids and
terpenes in this class, both for high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and for low THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two types of cannabis are only
separated by a couple of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is when you learn
something on low THC cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it applies to high THC cannabis back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a unique class and it's all
recorded online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is presentations like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We annotate the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also going to take you to the
greenhouse and to the laboratory to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you the work in progress with our team of
graduate students doing this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we use often, the nine
cardinal parameters of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four are in the root zone, five are in the
shoot zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown this slide in other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be effective because other people
use this slide to explain things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These parameters interact with each other
in really fascinating ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about them individually and
we'll talk about the interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you the modules right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll come back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seven modules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can register for each one
independently or if you sign up for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you get a bulk discount on the whole
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pricing is designed to match what a
two credit class would be at the
[SPEAKER_00]: university.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is open to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have to be a university
accepted student to apply for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can pay the tuition and take the
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting with optimizing the root
zone and look at the interactions we get
[SPEAKER_00]: with here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, water, oxygen, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients means both nutrition,
the principles, what things do plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: and in what ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also means the fertilizer and that's
the practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what do we apply in different
kinds of media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes the options for media down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's just look at the
interactions right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature interacts with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As temperature goes up, oxygen solubility
goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that do to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from our research, cannabis is
uniquely sensitive to low oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a finding that we've learned just
in the last year with research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water interacts with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water goes up, the oxygen goes down,
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we co-optimize all of these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to the shoot zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature and humidity interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a discipline called psychometrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of this class, you will know
the difference between relative humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and absolute humidity and you'll know how
those two parameters interact to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advantages of optimal CO2 and then
finally, kaboom, light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives the rates of all of these other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drive the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drive double the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drive the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything follows that and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The third module is just about optimizing
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lighting, HPS lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about all the kinds of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of research on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not do plant breeding, but we work
closely with plant breeders to test their
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the botany and the
genetic diversity and the emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities in breeding of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We own all female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the technologies for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding clothes with harvesting,
drying, curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we preserve everything and
optimally cure the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website for this is cannabis.usu.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that website, there's more detail and
also a link to register for the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: This class has the number of lectures that
about a three credit university level
[SPEAKER_00]: class would have, but we've priced it
modestly equivalent to about a two credit
[SPEAKER_00]: university class.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the tuition money that you pay for
this class goes to support graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: education in our laboratory at USU.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go to my salary doesn't go to
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to support additional research by
graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to teach this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the link and get more detail and we
look forward to having you in the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
