[SPEAKER_03]: A high-quality silicon cell pyranometer
can be a cost-effective alternative to a
[SPEAKER_03]: thermopile sensor for measuring solar
radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apogee pyranometers are widely used in
agriculture and solar energy applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: In clear sky conditions, apogee
pyranometers compare favorably to
[SPEAKER_03]: secondary standard reference pyranometers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at a fraction of the cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1996, we introduced a silicon cell
pyranometer that provided a low-cost
[SPEAKER_03]: alternative to more expensive sensors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through continuous innovation and
improvements to the design, our
[SPEAKER_03]: pyranometers are now known for quality and
durability.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an industry leader, apogee's
pyranometers have been included on systems
[SPEAKER_01]: from some of the biggest names in
environmental monitoring, such as Campbell
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientific, Columbia Weather Systems,
Toro, Rainbird, and many more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do these top companies trust apogee?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a research-driven company, apogee has
carefully refined our pyranometer design
[SPEAKER_01]: and manufacturing processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our pyranometers are built at our
headquarters in Logan, Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each sensor body is milled from
high-quality aluminum and is then coupled
[SPEAKER_01]: with custom optics and precision
electronics by our skilled technicians in
[SPEAKER_01]: carefully controlled conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a final step, all pyranometers are
thoroughly inspected and tested to ensure
[SPEAKER_01]: their quality and accuracy before we ship
them to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apogee pyranometers feature a patented
dome-shaped head that allows it to quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: shed water, dust, and other debris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyranometers with a flat or even recessed
top can trap rainfall and debris,
[SPEAKER_02]: which block the optical path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our self-cleaning design allows you to
collect accurate data without worrying
[SPEAKER_02]: about keeping it clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apogee pyranometers are filled with the
resin to create a barrier against water
[SPEAKER_02]: and humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hollow pyranometers can have significant
errors if water gets inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: With our design, moisture is completely
taken out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accuracy is a key property of any sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under clear sky conditions, apogee
pyranometers have a calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainty of plus or minus five percent
when compared to a reference thermopile
[SPEAKER_00]: pyranometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A key pyranometer characteristic is cosine
response or the relative error as a
[SPEAKER_00]: function of solar zenith angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee has achieved excellent cosine
correction through optimization of the
[SPEAKER_00]: diffuser material and shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing by the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory in Golden, Colorado has shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that apogee pyranometers are comparable to
the best thermopile pyranometers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sensor is only as good as its
calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ensure accuracy, each pyranometer is
calibrated in tightly controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory conditions traceable to ISO
reference standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maintain traceability to the world's
radiometric reference, every spring we
[SPEAKER_00]: send our reference pyranometers to the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory for
[SPEAKER_00]: recalibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, each apogee sensor is calibrated
with a standard output to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeable in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apogee features a full line of
pyranometers to fit our customers' needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our sensors come with standard pigtail
leads for easy integration with most data
[SPEAKER_01]: loggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Models include our flagship SP110,
which is our basic self-powered sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: with a full-scale output of 200
millivolts.
[SPEAKER_01]: For customers needing an even larger
signal, we offer three amplified models,
[SPEAKER_01]: the SP212 with a 0 to 2.5 volt output,
SP215 with 0 to 5 volt output,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the SP214 with a 4 to 20 milliamp
output.
[SPEAKER_01]: To improve year-round accuracy,
we developed the SP230 all-season
[SPEAKER_01]: pyranometer, which has a raised stand and
a tiny 0.18 watt internal heater that
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps the sensor clear of dew,
frost, and snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: For mobile measurements, apogee offers two
pyranometer options that include a
[SPEAKER_01]: handheld meter with a digital display.
[SPEAKER_01]: The MP100 features an integrated sensor in
the top of the meter, while the MP200
[SPEAKER_01]: features a separate sensor connected with
two meters of cable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Custom lead lengths are available on
request.
[SPEAKER_01]: The handheld meter displays instantaneous
readings or can be set in logging mode
[SPEAKER_01]: that can store up to 99 individual
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: For OEMs and system integrators,
apogee offers customizable options such as
[SPEAKER_01]: different multipliers, outputs,
cable lengths, and a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-installed connectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: With apogee, you're dealing directly with
the manufacturer, and we can work with you
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide pyranometers to fit your
specific need, no matter how big or small.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information on our line of
pyranometers, please contact one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: representatives or visit us on the web at
apogeeinstruments.com.
We'll see you next time.
