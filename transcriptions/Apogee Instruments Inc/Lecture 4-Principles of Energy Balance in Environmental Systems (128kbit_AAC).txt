[SPEAKER_00]: series and I want to get some closure Ryan
today on this topic of energy balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one little tidbit I want to
point out before I get into the Earth's
[SPEAKER_00]: energy balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph, remember how we said the
radiation can go above a thousand because
[SPEAKER_00]: of reflection from clouds and that causes
all kinds of people to panic about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens to be some data from the
campus environmental observatory for last
[SPEAKER_00]: January but it was a series of days that
were partly cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a black line on here that is
the calculated radiation for a clear sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is winter so it only goes to
about 450 watts per meter squared but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the value for the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's three different replicate
radiometers in here and this was partly
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudy, this is partly cloudy,
this was very cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then look at this day right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clouds acted like a lens like we
talked about and even though the clear sky
[SPEAKER_00]: was about 450, we had readings of 650 on
the instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't bad instruments, it was
reflection of light by clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes these can go way above clear
sky by radiation focusing on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we calculate net and shortwave on
here in addition but the main point here
[SPEAKER_00]: was to show this but it has been very
useful for us to calculate a clear sky
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation so you can tell here's a day
when it was clear sky and the instruments
[SPEAKER_00]: are close to the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came up with the sky, came down with
the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because the clear sky model is so
useful, there's a website that shows this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show it on the magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the magnet right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you have this magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, they're really bonded together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the third and final magnet that
we're going to talk about and this is at
[SPEAKER_00]: clearskycalculator.com and for any time of
day, any point in the world, this
[SPEAKER_00]: calculates the clear sky and it's
particularly accurate at solar noon and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use it to tell if your instruments
need to be recalibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our tests with this indicate in the
summer at solar noon, this is within 2% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the true value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coefficients you put in here include
humidity and temperature because of
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric continuation, elevation,
latitude, of course time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calculate radiation anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a little tidbit that's been
really useful to help people make better
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements for radiation and it's fairly
well widely used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it could be used a lot more widely
for people to make better measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this is the outline for today where
we hope to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation balance of the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we get these numbers,
we can figure out radiation for a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's this look if we do the whole planet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many diagrams like this but this
is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped into Paul Campbell's office a
year ago and he had this on the wall of
[SPEAKER_00]: his office and I gave it to him and he
loved it so we put it on his wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's all the incoming solar energy to
the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 6% boom right off the bat reflected by
the atmosphere right back into space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouds, this is a variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's more clouds, more reflection
but some clouds and then finally earth
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, pretty small reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absorbed by the atmosphere a tiny bit but
then finally here's the absorbed by land
[SPEAKER_00]: and oceans and then this warms up and it
re-radiates into space as long wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's coming in as short wave and it's
going out as long wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these colors because the burner on
a stove glows red and that's long wave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are small numbers but you
can see how this is a delicate balance if
[SPEAKER_00]: this radiation balance changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all the apparent controversy about
global warming, we know CO2 absorbs long
[SPEAKER_00]: wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know CO2 is going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can mathematically calculate the
absorption of CO2 of radiation by CO2 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air and calculate the heating caused
by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could say how could this be
controversial?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are known physical principles and as
we say the absorption of long wave
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation by CO2 is unassailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly how it changes this
cooling by long wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the amazing thing about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we had, well you could see them
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's not numbers on here but this
is a thousand watts in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are big numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a paper by a whole bunch of
authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the key authors is James Hansen who
was quite famous for in circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's testified before Congress many times
on this and look at how many offers they
[SPEAKER_00]: put in these papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our climate model driven by human-made
greenhouse gases aerosols calculates that
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth is now absorbing 0.85 watts per
meter squared more energy than the Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: than it's emitting to space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than one watt is the energy imbalance
of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he puts a plus a minus 0.15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some serious models.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not saying oh this is less than
five percent, we'll throw that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though these are known physical
principles, the energy imbalance is small
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's enough to cause the temperature
to rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only controversy about global
warming is what's the effect of rising
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes it's rising and yes it's caused by CO2
and yes the CO2 is caused by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canadians have a t-shirt that says I'm
in favor of global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people it's not a bad thing to
them and then people say well look it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to melt the ice caps, raise the
ocean, Miami will be flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can move.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what's happening, it's how
serious is the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we get into erratic
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all that happened was a slow steady
increase in temperature, a few tenths of a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree per decade, we can deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the weather goes chaotic,
now we got a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the cutting edge of climate
science research is will global warming
[SPEAKER_00]: cause erratic weather?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of evidence that it does
but people disagree about how much erratic
[SPEAKER_00]: weathers might happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it changes rainfall patterns,
that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can change agriculture, it can cause
a lot of famine for a lot of people just
[SPEAKER_00]: by shifts in rainfall patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me that's the cutting edge of
climate change research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not whether it's happening but what are
the long-term consequences going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I read this paper some years ago
but I just about fell out of my chair as I
[SPEAKER_00]: think of the fluxes of these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to go into this a tiny bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several years ago, zoom out on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: NASA got ready to launch a satellite
called glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a brochure on glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding the Earth's energy budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now NASA has lots of satellites doing this
already but this one had specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments to get some of the
lesser-known parameters to measure more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all so excited about this
satellite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took years of work and had really
expensive instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blew up on launch and now we're trying
to get money again to launch another
[SPEAKER_00]: version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this brochure was a two-page
analysis of the Earth's energy budget that
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought was the best short summary I had
ever read of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sharing it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two handouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the one I just showed which shows
percentages of all these arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a sense of what those
arrows all look like on a single leaf by
[SPEAKER_00]: the same principles to the whole planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one shows absolute numbers on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be able to focus this a tiny bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one shows absolute numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see them here but they're on
this handout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's reflected and absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course these numbers change as the
Earth rotates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not always measuring it right
pointed at the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nighttime in there and we're on
the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a nutshell this shows these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another reason, another thing
that helps you understand some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: controversy in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what's called radiative forcings
which is just another name for what's
[SPEAKER_00]: causing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to zoom in on this just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiative forcing components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is becoming more and more common
for people to express their data like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you haven't seen this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people debate the size of the error
bars on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also helps you understand the
controversy of a global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that bar goes up that means it's a
factor causing the Earth to get warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes down it's a factor causing
Earth to get colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's things on here that
reflected radiation the Earth would cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they absorb it gets warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest bar in this graph in the end
over here is the net of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That error bar is our difference among the
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of what CO2 is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1.5, 1.6 watts per meter squared plus
or minus 0.1 or 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not very controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methane, nitrogen oxide gases,
and halocarbons are real powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbers of longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just traces of these have a big effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cumulatively these add about another
watt per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have been going into the atmosphere
before they were people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But human activities have increased these
other gases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work on methane and
nitrogen oxides and other things now in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to just CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we go into ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's tiny elements of cooling and
heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much smaller bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger error bar on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stratospheric water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny changes in atmospheric water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water absorbs longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the humidity changes, it drives
warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then albedo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we painted the Earth white,
we'd cool it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, land use changes can mean that more
radiation gets reflected into space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have big forests, they absorb a lot
of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have bare ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reflect more radiation into space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's bigger error bars here,
but it's plus and minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get to aerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Droplets, tiny droplets of things in the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had a microscope, you could see
them, but they're droplets of liquids in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reflect radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at the size of these error bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albedo effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those clouds that are causing us
complications in our model.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cloudy all the time, the Earth is
going to cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the huge variables in
here is what the clouds do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because look at the size of that error
bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouds are aerosols after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple other tiny factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changes in solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People said the Sun is just putting out
more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's above zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a pretty big error bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not a big effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to say it's all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are minor compared to the
Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the data doesn't support that
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the net effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this model shows about 1.6 watts per
meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the paper I just showed had 0.85 watts
per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see where the different models
vary a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are no models that say this is
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are no models that say it's a
negative number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just vary in the magnitude of the
warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this helps explain why it's
controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some things make it cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things make it warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years we've worked with NASA on
long-term space missions growing food for
[SPEAKER_00]: people in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the issues is terraforming Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't we just start making Mars more of a
nicer planet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, but it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll just fly some stuff up there
that turns it black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a planet darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you run the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make Mars a darker color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the absorption up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start to warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll melt the water into ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty soon we start to create an
atmosphere up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're literally smart people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying let's get Mars darker so we can,
might take 50, 100 years, but let's get it
[SPEAKER_00]: darker so we can go and live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is these application of energy
balance principles to whole planets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole universe has to follow the first law
of thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as we know, we haven't discovered a
universe that doesn't have to follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take those principles to other
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all the conversation and debate
about global warming, I think it's useful
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to be a bit more educated,
particularly when you get the principles
[SPEAKER_00]: of short-wave and long-wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can take those and apply them to
lots of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure where NASA is on another
satellite, but a big part of that one was
[SPEAKER_00]: to do aerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is following up now in my order of my
organization on a few little things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when radiation absorbed equals
radiation in times one minus albedo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we said for a typical leaf,
the albedo is one minus 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, here's short-wave radiation
again, short and long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the short wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the long wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ls over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long wave is really pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what wavelength it is
for long wave as far as absorption of
[SPEAKER_00]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matters a lot for transmission through the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about long wave
radiation, a number that's at 8,000 would
[SPEAKER_00]: behave similarly to 50,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all those wavelengths are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not true for short wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wavelengths matter a lot for short
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we say 50% albedo or 25% when
people talk about albedo, they are talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about an average of all the wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember this is about 280 nanometers
to 3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole thing is in units of
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of times you see this in micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These wavelengths matter a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get to this in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the textbook,
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, figure 7.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows for a typical leaf what's
absorbed, what's reflected, and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this is very far from a
flat line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that 50% is an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micrometers 0.4 to 0.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember this is 40% of the total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all absorbed of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what causes photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to 700 and the chlorophyll
molecule does not absorb light past 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say that plants are pretty
smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let that thermal radiation go right
through or they reflect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this radiation is like 10% absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This near-infrared radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we draw it on our graph right here,
we have UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 400 and 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 95% absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This radiation in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then suddenly it gets just past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I control this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this part of it out here is maybe 10%
absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the exact wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this bounces around out here a
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simplifies the model a great deal to
say we just have one number for albedo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're dealing with plants and
not just parking lots and other surfaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to know that these vary a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the diagram in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of people diagram the same thing
in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a diagram from another book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like this a little better because
it's not on a log scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it has absorption here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit more green light bounces
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit more is transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boom!
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at 700 nanometers, the reflection
and transmission go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're real low until we get out here
to 1.4, 1.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they become absorbed more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amount of radiation is going down
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are huge amounts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after we get out here, there's just
much less radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows differential absorption by the
leaf of those components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell you were worried about
this because this is the handout from the
[SPEAKER_00]: other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back off so you see the whole thing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the handout that talked about
typical values for albedo and emissivity
[SPEAKER_00]: of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you kept reading for being in
advance, you're itchy to ask me what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with these numbers down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I got to fold this to show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom of this is what happens to
this radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll zoom in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are typical numbers on the
bottom of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it segues into longwave too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on here I put 90% absorbed and over
here I put 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how thick the leaf is,
whether it's 90 or 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly equal amounts of reflection and
transmission to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We draw our line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it switches to mostly reflection and
transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a big reason leaves can stay
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not having to absorb that thermal
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's of no value to them unless they're
cold and they want to try and get warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they got plenty of light to keep them
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this to longwave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 4,000 to 100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is micrometers and this should say
nanometers right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 96% absorbed of longwave and we had
emissivity and absorptivity of 0.96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay what happens to the other 0.04 if
it's not absorbed by the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is it's reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a tiny bit of longwave radiation
that gets reflected by surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tinfoil reflects 97% of longwave
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for thermal radiation, tinfoil is just
like a mirror.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we put a piece of tinfoil right
here and I put an infrared gun on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wouldn't tell us hardly anything about
the temperature of the tinfoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would tell us the temperature of the
people in the glass because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: reflecting all the people in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a tiny number, but when we get
into rigorous analysis of energy balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: this 4% matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a field, it's just reflected back
into space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on the situation,
it can get reabsorbed somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does it do with the 4%?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's reflected, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 96% becomes heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thermal radiation and it makes the
object.
[SPEAKER_00]: get hotter until it reaches a new
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's converted to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we said the other day, this is a big
reason leaves are warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course the good news is they can
also by radiation get rid of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's highly absorbed, but not
completely 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little example here about
emissivity and absorption of reflection
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to the use of some instruments to
measure radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the place that I have found that's the
most interesting about this is in
[SPEAKER_00]: buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All buildings built in the last 10 to 15
years have low E glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever dealt with the building,
you've heard of low E glass if you heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of that, Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's low E glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the rage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes, we're putting low E glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is low emissivity glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That glass looks like tinfoil for
long-wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now exactly the physics of how they're
doing that I'm a little fuzzy on because
[SPEAKER_00]: we could certainly put tinfoil up and it
would be very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this glass right here, this is a new
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has low E glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is, let's do some research right
now about the emissivity of the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little cheap infrared gun and
we got several around here and I've bought
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get these things for under $25
and it gives you the surface temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're remarkably accurate for what
they cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if I can get this in Celsius
so we understand the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a test right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting, and I can't see this,
I'm getting 32 Celsius for this glass and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably the temperature of the
ceiling up here in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the glass is pretty warm because
the sun's shining on it, 3% of the signal,
[SPEAKER_00]: if this was that low E, this is probably
not the same as tinfoil, the emissivity
[SPEAKER_00]: might be let's say it's 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature I'm measuring is 10% of
the true surface temperature and 90% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's warmer than the ceiling but it's
certainly not the temperature of that
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most of the things in here are,
I mean we could do it on, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: this is low E glass because it's not an
exterior wall, but if we did it on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see this has a little red LED so
you can tell where you're pointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that was cold and this was warm,
it'd reflect and it'd tell us the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the concept of low E and let me try
and attempt to take this one step farther.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I know for sure, as soon as
anybody learns the principles of these
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, they want to own a lot of
instruments to measure it because then
[SPEAKER_00]: they understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a thermal imaging camera now
these things are 25 bucks and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate ones cost a few hundred dollars,
but this thermal imaging camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: these have come down fast and a thousand
bucks, something like that for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they used to be a lot more than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's see if we can point,
now I don't know if the camera can get
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but we point at this window and it's
telling us the glass is warmer than the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, but mostly the glass is,
it's reflecting the long wave off the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, excellent, terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh you're going to get a, we're going to
test some low E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway here, you can see me in this,
what parts of me are hotter than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really useful for refining
measurements of different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The absolute accuracy of these is not the
greatest, but the relative accuracy is
[SPEAKER_00]: really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see tiny changes in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get out of the way, we can start to
see the windows in this, the boards much
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could pass this around and you can look
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just charged it up, so hopefully it's
got enough charge to last for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, but this, if you spend a few minutes
with this pointing it at things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really drives home the principles of
long wave radiation and the value of using
[SPEAKER_00]: long wave emissivity to get temperature of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have one more demonstration of low E
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down to Bennett's glass and I said,
don't you guys have a demo of this that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps people understand low E and they got
all excited and they said, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah, we can order one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for people selling low E glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This side right here is ordinary glass and
this side over here is low E glass and
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, 15 years ago there was just
only primitive low E glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it's almost cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone has to use low E because
it keeps the heat in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to lose heat by radiation
and it works both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cold radiation outside, it doesn't
radiate inside anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cold is reflected on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's start our experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a light?
[SPEAKER_00]: These little radiometers spin in
proportion to how much radiation is
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting them and you can see that the
ordinary glass is making this spin more
[SPEAKER_00]: than the low E glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can this see it too?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the principle of low E.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are real cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them in the window and they spin
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for people that really just want
to see a demo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand the physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to see a demo and the
ordinary glass makes that spin more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would you calibrate one of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take, this is called a Leslie
cube, but it's a cube full of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a cone inside painted as black as we
can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special flat black paint so that
emissivity gets very .99 something for the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a cone shaped, the long wave
bounces back and forth sideways so the
[SPEAKER_00]: emissivity gets even higher because it's a
cone shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my assistant has filled this with hot
water and now we could put this right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it holds it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to get close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we getting there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's go over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a silver side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not emitting the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touch it and it feels hot and they're
exactly the same temperature, but because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is such high emissivity, it gives us
a bigger number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use these in an instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use these to determine the field
of view because all these instruments have
[SPEAKER_00]: a cone-shaped field of view and you would
like to think that this little red dot,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only getting that red dot,
but it's in fact averaging, this one's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably averaging a two or three meter
squared area out there because it's low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get just the red dot,
you got to pay more for a more precise
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can take these and if I do this
and it's got a high temperature and I
[SPEAKER_00]: start to move it back away quite quickly,
it'll start to see the edges and it's no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer measuring just that black cone
because it's averaging the cone plus this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the higher quality instruments,
you can go far away and it'll still just
[SPEAKER_00]: see the cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons you pay more for
higher-end instruments and you can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap ones like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus these work pretty good if the
temperatures are all within five degrees C
[SPEAKER_00]: of the instrument, but if you try to
measure a hot surface with this,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just not very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another problem with radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem with radiometers is they
always measure the delta T because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always an exchange of radiation between
the instrument and the surface and it
[SPEAKER_00]: measures, says this is my temperature,
that surface is five degrees warmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it adds the two numbers together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is emissivity on principles of it
and fortunately glass helps you to see
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do all kinds of things with
tinfoil in here too, showing how it
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects the radiation like a mirror and
it shows the power and the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the emissivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two simple equations or laws that relate
to radiation that are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is Wien's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pronounced Wien's.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a German guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years ago he's looking at the
relationship between long wave and short
[SPEAKER_00]: wave radiation and he says as objects get
hotter they radiate at shorter wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is showing us a dichotomy of
short and long, but wait a minute isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: there stuff here in the middle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes there could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wien's law says, now let's erase this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximum wavelength and in this case
this would be this point right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum equals, no I'm going to be
simpler, it's proportional to one over
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real simple, inversely proportional to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the temperature of an object gets
hotter it radiates at shorter and shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is low temperature objects out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Sun right here and the peak
number from the Sun is 550 I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: put nanometers or micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look at the yellow magnet that's
pretty close to that peak wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I switched to micrometers,
0.55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's put some numbers in this and
solve it and so now after we get the
[SPEAKER_00]: concept here, now if we do equal sign,
first of all this is temperature in Kelvin
[SPEAKER_00]: not in Celsius and this is the maximum
wavelength in micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have units, but it's not one
over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a constant and this constant is
28.97.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the entire Wien's law,
roughly 3000 divided by the temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin of the object will give us the peak
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the Sun is radiating at 0.5
micrometers, now we're going to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: math to make this simple, 0.5 micrometers,
how hot is the Sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we rearrange Wien's law temperature
in Kelvin and I'm going to put some,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to round that to 300 and this
is 0.5 micrometers rounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sun is 6000 Kelvin, rounding to make
the math easy and that's pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have anything on the Earth that's
that hot, which is why this shortwave is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has to be that hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we put, how about the inside of an
oven?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to bake the turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to, let's take this off and now
we're going to say maximum wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: 3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to put temperature in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you bake a turkey, it's 400 degrees or
a pizza at 400 degrees, that's roughly 200
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inside of an oven might be 273 plus
a couple hundred, 500 Kelvin to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: math easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 6,
[SPEAKER_00]: now I got a mistake in here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is coming out to 6 micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no it's not a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 0.5 and a hot oven is out here
at, these are nanometers, so this is 8
[SPEAKER_00]: micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a hot oven is over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: 6 micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why terrestrial objects all
radiate out in here depending on their
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even a hot oven doesn't get us to
shortwave radiation, it's still longwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all described by Wien's law and
there's another application of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a graph of doing this for a couple
of temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's 5,500 Kelvin and as this gets
cooler, it shifts out here to longer
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths, not by much, but it shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see two things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Stefan Boltzmann equation?
[SPEAKER_00]: The total radiation is determined by the
temperature and as the temperature gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler, the area under this curve gets
less and as it gets hotter, it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: more blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more, the hotter the object,
the more blue, the cooler the object,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more orange and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use Wien's law, 0.1% of the people
in the world know this, to determine color
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures of lights and all kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say in film, this is a 4,000 Kelvin
film and this light is some Kelvin
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them are smooth curves,
it's just an effective way to say the
[SPEAKER_00]: color temperature of objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about color temperature,
but it's from Wien's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the number, the more blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The output blue lights have, you could say
a cool white fluorescent, which is blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: might be a 6,000 Kelvin light and a warm
white fluorescent, which is more orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: might be a 3,000 Kelvin light and that all
comes from Wien's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shift from the maximum
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see those color temperatures
and you think through this and anytime
[SPEAKER_00]: it's inversely proportional, you have to
shift your thinking a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot objects are more blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planck's equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have my picture of Planck here,
but he's one of the top 25 scientists of
[SPEAKER_00]: all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this picture he has a tie on and
little tiny glasses and he just makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: look like he was a very organized guy and
he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived to be 82 years old, which is a
real accomplishment in the 1800s when he
[SPEAKER_00]: lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this refrigerator magnet,
which everybody's got on their filing
[SPEAKER_00]: cabinet now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're showing this both in photons and
energy and the shape of the curve and the
[SPEAKER_00]: photon flux is all the physiologists that
are modeling and predicting photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: and the energy flux is all the
meteorologists that are modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and the differences in
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're obviously both important and
they're different shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any way to go back and forth
between joules?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is per meter squared per second per
nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is meter squared per second
nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any way to go back and forth
between joules and moles of photons?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is thanks to Mach's Planck
and what I do with my black marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Mach's Planck, I'm going to
erase some of this to give Planck lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: room for his equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very simple equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy per photon is
[SPEAKER_00]: proportional to one over the wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real similar to this, only this is
temperature and quality of the light and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is helping us go back, allowing us to
go back and forth between joules or watts
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy and photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So energy drives thermal reactions and
photons drive a whole other set of
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions like photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that one photon excites one
electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called the Stark-Einstein law and
that's what causes photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what causes electricity in
a solar photovoltaic cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: One photon excites one electron and we get
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those solar photovoltaic cells aren't
running off of thermal radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need short-wave radiation and we need
to count photons to determine electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get Planck's equation inversely
proportional to wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we change this to equals,
this one becomes h and c and c is the
[SPEAKER_00]: speed of light, h is Planck's constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have these two numbers memorized
but they're big numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is joules per photon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put numbers in this, and this is how
I remember it because it's like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you work it out for one value and
then you can rate forever racial things to
[SPEAKER_00]: that value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do hc over 550 nanometers,
now this is right in the middle between
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 and 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: 550 is the average wavelength of light
from the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's green light, it's average light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the middle, this comes out to be
217 kilojoules per mole of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting these numbers in, I'll work out a
page with the step-by-step math worked out
[SPEAKER_00]: on this and all the numbers in it,
but there's a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you say what would the energy,
what would this number be at 600,
[SPEAKER_00]: well you can easily ratio this and you get
this relationship here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Planck's equation allows us to go back
and forth between energy and moles and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep going with this equation like we
have here to 800, 900, 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: These photons are associated with longer
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have less energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of the UV photons are
really high energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if this was 315 nanometers,
this thing would be, let me see if we took
[SPEAKER_00]: half of this, 275 this would be over 400
kilojoules per mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's high energy photons, which is why
ultraviolet photons are so degrading to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super high energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, I don't know, they're like
third graders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just got a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get out here to 900 and it's the
people with canes and there's low energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still one person, but they're low
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these photons pass 700, no longer have
enough energy to excite electrons for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, so we don't count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here they're too high of energy for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're damaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that much down here either,
so it's got to be just in this right
[SPEAKER_00]: range, but it leads to the shapes of these
curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incidentally, solar photovoltaics are in
the laboratory, similar efficiency to
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a good solar photovoltaics,
now you get up 30-40% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis can be 30-40% too in the
lab and they're both going off of one
[SPEAKER_00]: photon excites one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: One makes carbohydrates and the other one
makes electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solar panels can use these photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep absorbing out to a thousand,
even 1,100 out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So solar panels can use some of this
longer wave radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis can't and it's generally
why solar photovoltaics are more efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: than photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can capture that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the question is, how come plants are
green?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's so much green light,
wouldn't they want to capture that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, this is a fairly flat curve,
so it's not that much different green
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, why don't they absorb
everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they have a dip at all in green
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they could capture that green light
too, they'd be more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could say, well, chlorophyll just
doesn't absorb green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That molecule, well, then it's a bad
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have got something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I like to think of it is
animals came along and they eat plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our eyes can see green light better
than any other wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we drew our eyes on here, I can put it
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green, put it on here in black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our eyes look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see green really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see blues and reds very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So animals evolved to be able to see
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants reflected the green light,
and the animals that could see that green
[SPEAKER_00]: light found the plants better and got more
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard anyone else say that,
but that's a good sounding hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that wavelengths of light
reflected by plants are the ones that we
[SPEAKER_00]: see the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could also ask, couldn't we invent
a better molecule for plants that captured
[SPEAKER_00]: all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know there's lots of pigments in
plants besides chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at older plant physiology
textbooks, they say, well, plants don't
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb much green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, let me answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this done with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our 400 to 700 blown up big.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at a plant physiology
textbook, chlorophyll looks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absorbs blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's chlorophyll A and B, but they look
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absorb blues and reds, but the
chlorophyll hardly absorbs any green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the plant physiology textbooks
said, well, chlorophyll doesn't absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: much green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we invented efficient LEDs,
that were blues and reds, a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: people went, wow, these are perfect for
plants because they match the absorption
[SPEAKER_00]: of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: There still are no efficient green LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have them, but they're not efficient at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said the LEDs are perfect for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They match the absorption of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found out they really don't
work very well through 10, 20 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take a modern plant physiology
textbook, they have curves in here like
[SPEAKER_00]: this and like this, and they're all
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an amount of colors, but you get
the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of curves in those
now, and they say multiple pigments absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: all the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new pigment, psychorethrin,
is discovered in algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was clarified in algae just a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's peak absorptions in green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the potential to genetically
engineer to put more psychorethrin in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and then they will get that green
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't look green anymore,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look, I don't know, black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a long answer to an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come they don't get pigments to
capture every speck of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would like to see is pigments
so they could use some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of energy right in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could just get pigments to get
up to 800, wow!
[SPEAKER_00]: We could feed the world, but we don't have
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll ends at 700 and then nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they would absorb more heat too,
but will precision irrigate and save water
[SPEAKER_00]: and get more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do pigments do what they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they evolve?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, is the limiting factor
absorbing radiation for yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is the limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plant in the spring, we got
beautiful light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's May and early June, there's a lot of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of it's wasted because it hits the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the little nice green plants,
but 90% is wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally they fill in and yield takes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an example of absorbed
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're talking about here is after
it fills in, couldn't we get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, here's one answer to the question,
kind of a smart-ass answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They already absorbed 95% and you're
complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't we get this to 98?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be a 3% and every little
bit helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop here and we'll take a
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the end of radiation lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we come back in a few minutes,
we will talk about transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this is we're going to get
transpiration by subtraction or can't we
[SPEAKER_00]: just measure it directly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
Let's take a break.
