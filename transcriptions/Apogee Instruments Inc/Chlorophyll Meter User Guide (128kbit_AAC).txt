[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith here at
Apogee Instruments, and today we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about the MC100.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a demonstration with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about how to take
measurements with it, how to save samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to read the different units,
the CCIE units, the SPAD units,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the micromoles per meter squared of
chlorophyll, depending on specific species
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also a generic species we have
for that, how to change the meter to read
[SPEAKER_00]: for those, and then how to get all the
saved data off the meter onto the computer
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're going to briefly touch on
if you want to add the GPS module as an
[SPEAKER_00]: add-on feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do that we do need the overhead
camera, so we're just going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: that, so that'll just take a second to
come up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that comes up, you can see right here
in front of us we have the MC100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the full unit, okay, and we're
zoomed in tight so we can see the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're going to go through the
settings on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing, we're going to hit power,
it's going to beep, and that's how we know
[SPEAKER_00]: it is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see three things right off the bat,
we see run, data, and save, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: see our time and date stamp up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if this is not correct and you want to
change this, then the first thing you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to click on is system, and then you want
to go to setup, and then it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us our time, date, and the format
it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to edit that, right there,
and then as a note this is a 24-hour
[SPEAKER_00]: clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go ahead and hit edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first we want to set this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to first set up how we want to
save the files, and then we want to set up
[SPEAKER_00]: how many averages we're going to take,
and then we're going to set up the units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing, how do we set up the
files?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go to run, and then we go to setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that comes up is save
data and data file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit edit, and then when yes is
highlighted, so we want to save data yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe we want to rename that data
file, or change it to something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: or understand why it came up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we hit over, it comes up with the
file name manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now right now it says use existing file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any files on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is enter a new name.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we wanted to just go ahead and type out
a new name, we could do that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is edit a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a default name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is use date as name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our example, we're going to go
ahead and use the date as the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes up with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the year first, followed by
the month, followed by the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by the hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this looks perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we want to save for our
demonstration today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to hit accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all of that set up,
our file name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is if we want to do
averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are three different test
measurement ways you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in multi-point average,
as it's showing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in one-point no averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do multi-point standard
deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by talking about one-point
no averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that every time that you take a
measurement on a leaf, that it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: saving every measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you point, it's just taking a
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not doing any averaging for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this average number of points in
recorded point data, they do not apply in
[SPEAKER_00]: that feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multi-point standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one, it will take your standard
deviation as an average of between 10 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to change this number of point
to between 10 and 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on this last one, record point data,
if you have this in no, right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it means that it is only going to
save your standard deviation, your average
[SPEAKER_00]: standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in yes, it's going to save every
individual point as you measure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as well as that, it's going to save
your average standard deviations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as a note on that feature,
if for any reason your measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: different, are larger than two times the
standard deviation, then the instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: itself is going to throw out that outlier
and cause you to take another measurement,
[SPEAKER_00]: ask you to take another measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware of that if that happens
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our example, let's do multi-point
averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to do multi-point
averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to ask you how many points to
average, and then record point data.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the record point data, if you put no,
it's only going to record the averages for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put yes, it's going to record
every single point when you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement, as well as the averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we click enter here, and then if we
click over, it will ask us the average
[SPEAKER_00]: number of points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can push up or down here to get the
average number of points higher or lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our example today, three is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the record point data, yes,
that is fine as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just hit enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next on the menu is this data echo output
as off, and GPS data logging off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data echo output refers to the
RS-232, which is the port on the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you had an RS-232 to a serial
cable, and you wanted it to be sending
[SPEAKER_00]: data out through that, as well as logging
data on the unit itself, you would have
[SPEAKER_00]: that on, and then you'd have that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more details on that, just contact us
here at tech support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then same on the second one,
the GPS data logging, you would also plug
[SPEAKER_00]: in to that same 232 port, some sort of GPS
module, and then you'd click on this menu,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you'd have that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, for more details on that,
just contact us here, and we'll tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: what we have found that has worked for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, use custom measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it's asking us here is what is the
unit that we want to read our chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: in?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about we have CCI units,
we have SPAD units, and then we have units
[SPEAKER_00]: of chlorophyll in terms of micromoles per
meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it says use custom measurement,
it says no right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That saying no means it is in CCI units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our example, let's go ahead and
start with doing it in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll of micromoles per meter
squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our example, let us pull up our
heart lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to do some chlorophyll readings
off of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's start by doing generic readings
first, the generic chlorophyll table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to change this, we go to edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We change that to yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I push the side button,
it's going to ask us which one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all the custom tables it
comes loaded with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since philodendron chordatum is not
loaded, not listed in here, we just want
[SPEAKER_00]: the generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go ahead and hit generic,
hit OK, accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's saying use custom units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, use generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are all set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are ready to start taking measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we click measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says clear sample area and hold
down the arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will go ahead and just hold down the
arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now for our example, we'll just go
ahead and come over here, pick belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that it says average point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives us the reading for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll do that on the second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see what it reads after the
second one and then the third one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives us a double beep saying it
has taken an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is giving us our average and
then telling us it's in that generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our data, let's go ahead and do
three more.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we have our two averages using the
generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wonder how our Heartleaf Ivy also
reads in sped units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's change it to sped units and save
some averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit exit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go into setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we hit up and it has used custom
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we hit over, now we just need
to go down until we get to sped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just we will scroll through all the
different species we could click on that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have coefficients saved in for micro
moles of chlorophyll per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll come down till we get to sped.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is telling us custom measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sped units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we hit exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we hit measure, it's going to say this
file already exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to override it or do you want
to append it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we just want to append it because
we're just taking the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're measuring the same plant,
same leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just doing it in a different unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to hit append.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come up here and take a
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telling us the average point one in sped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if for some reason there was a
measurement error, we could just hit
[SPEAKER_00]: delete and then it would ask us to take
that average point two again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three beeps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us it did the average and it's
telling us across the top one that it
[SPEAKER_00]: saved that one because we said save every
save a sample every three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two of those now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's do it in CCI units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we've saved that our plant here
with the generic coefficients,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've saved them as sped units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's save them as CCI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We push up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use custom measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use custom units.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we push there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When yes is highlighted, we push up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now saying use custom units.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that says no, that means we are
now reading in CCI units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to say you're on that same
file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to override or append it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in our example, we just want to
append it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just hit there and then we are
good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our first reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second reading
[SPEAKER_00]: and our third reading in CCI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just for uniformity,
we will go ahead and take three more.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now have all these measurements
saved on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we want to get them onto the
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get out of the test menu here and we
hit back and we see where it says data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our example, we need to just take
the USB.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's supplied with it and plug it into
the USB on the model right here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we hit data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says USB link active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we need to turn on our computer
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see in our example that it
comes up just like a flash drive would
[SPEAKER_00]: with the information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see all these tables come up on
the file.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the saved tables to the
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right here is our file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I double click here, my text
documents automatically open up as
[SPEAKER_00]: notepad, however you have your text
documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can see the time date stamp
across the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that we're doing averaging
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see these are our generic
coefficients for micromoles of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our three readings here,
our average, our three readings here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see our SPAD units here,
the average, SPAD units and average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see our CCI units and our CCI
units and our average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that that comes in a CSV
file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's real easy to drop into a
spreadsheet for more analysis as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, that concludes our
demonstration of the MC100, how to take
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
