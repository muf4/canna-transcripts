[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Skyler Smith,
and I do technical sales and support here
[SPEAKER_00]: at Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're going to talk about the
Lab Spector Radiometers, our PS100,
[SPEAKER_00]: 200, and 300 units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get into the overview,
I know a lot of people do troubleshooting
[SPEAKER_00]: watching these videos, so I just wanted to
point out how to get to our support page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you click on support up in the
corner from apogeeinstruments.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you'll click here on the icon
that shows both our versions of spector
[SPEAKER_00]: radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to take you to our
spector radiometer page support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see you'll be able to find
the manuals there, the spec sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to refer you back to this as
well because we're going to cover a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information fast in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have any questions that you
need to go over again, I'll refer you back
[SPEAKER_00]: there to the product manuals or the
frequently asked questions I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to answer and address your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this video is going to cover the common
applications of spector radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences between the models,
setting up the instrument, demonstrating
[SPEAKER_00]: the software, and then just how to export
that to Excel sheets, exporting those
[SPEAKER_00]: graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does a spector radiometer do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it gives you the intensity of light
at each wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you that curve so you know how
much red, how much blue, how much green
[SPEAKER_00]: there is in a light, and it's graphing it
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our model allows you to take that
intensity and then apply that to a unit of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the amount of photon flux,
the amount of energy flux density
[SPEAKER_00]: readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's par in micromoles per meter squared
per second or watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also do transmittance measurements
and then reflectance measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reflectance measurements are really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here this reference where it gives
all these different things that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: look at as far as NDVI, PRI, red edge
NDVI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you know the intensities at these
wavelengths, you can use these various
[SPEAKER_00]: formulas to get your chlorophyll content,
your carotenoids, and all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that these studies show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have that reference there,
and it's also below in the comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can email us as well if you're
curious about this particular page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, PS100, PS200, PS300.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it really comes down to range and
wavelength resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see we have our sensor,
the sensitivity across the first row here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the PS100, 350 to 1150, the PS200,
190 to 850, and the PS300, 220 to 1100
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the visible light range that usually
most of the time we're concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: with plants is 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see any of these three will
cover that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference is in the wavelength
resolution, for one, the PS200 has the
[SPEAKER_00]: finest resolution out of all of them,
whereas the PS300 covers the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated range from 300 to 1000
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the wavelength resolution on the
PS100 is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has one nanometer resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't go as far down into the UV
as the PS300 does.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have the same detector type,
but then the grading is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different on the PS200 and the PS300.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's that same holographic
aberration corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you're welcome to dig
deeper into that to see exactly what the
[SPEAKER_00]: holographic and aberration corrected
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just helps you get that finer
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all 16-bit units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put this up here as the
written instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to demonstrate this
here in a little bit after we do the
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to have this up here for
troubleshooting if anyone's trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: their unit going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two steps of every measurement,
number one, set the integration time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The integration time is like the shutter
on a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It controls the amount of light hitting
the detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's too much light, it saturates
the signal, and it doesn't allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a correct reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's too little light,
then it doesn't have enough light to
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly take the readings to see what
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way the integration time is set is
in view and scope mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do have to sometimes play with
that so that you get that integration time
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in so that it's maximized and
correctly giving you the output.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have that integration time set,
then it's step two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, this is our example of
integration times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here the integration time looking
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that it maximizes right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas over here, you can see it's
saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flat lines across the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means your integration time is too
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to bring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's straight out of the manual
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need another reference on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have the integration time,
then we go to the dark scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dark scan is done by simply taking
the dark cap, putting over the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: detector here, and then we hit the dark
bulb here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that essentially zeros out the unit so
that then it gives us a flat line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we do those two things,
then we can actually have a useful
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and cover the
demonstration on how to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, as well as how to set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the unit comes to you, you have the
head, the cap, the fiber optic cable here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the unit itself,
the spectroradiometer unit, and the USB
[SPEAKER_00]: cable, along with the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes, you can go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hook up the USB.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can screw on the fiber optic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can screw on the fiber optic to both
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If yours doesn't come with it in here,
you can screw the top off here and screw
[SPEAKER_00]: on the fiber optic to the unit underneath
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll show unscrewing that off here in
a little bit when we do our reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our unit is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes to you on a little USB jump drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is the information it comes
with right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple ways to do this next
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I'm going to show you is to take
all that information on the USB jump drive
[SPEAKER_00]: and save it onto a folder onto our
desktop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here, I've just saved all that
information right into a folder on my
[SPEAKER_00]: desktop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to run the install from
this one, as opposed to running it off the
[SPEAKER_00]: jump drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a preference,
but I find it works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we're here, we can now run the
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll close out of our jump drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's open it off of our desktop version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know our desktop is saved on our C
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: StellarNet software 5.33.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll double click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to SW update install.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll ask you if you want to run this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through a few steps there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the software is installed on your C
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have that one done, is we need to
get the 64-bit driver installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you do that is you come back
here to kind of the home screen here on
[SPEAKER_00]: our jump drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to SW drivers 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have SW driver 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to run this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we right click on it, and we want
to run as administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in the habit of right click run as
administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what makes Stellar the Spectre with
software work the best every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we right click, run as administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to say, do you want to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come up with this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what that has done is it has installed
the install instructions onto the C drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we come over, let's open up another
Windows file explorer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just right clicked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm just going to come up here to
file explorer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to come down here to my
C drive, OS C drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to look for one that
says SW driver 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an alphabetical in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I open up this folder,
it's going to have these, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to say, install it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I want to install this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I do that is I right click,
run as administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we run it, say do you want
to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, it tells you the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run as administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total attempted one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number successfully imported zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine says zero because it's already
installed on mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If yours says zero, it's probably already
installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can see if there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yours should say one of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that it was done correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll also notice it's done
correctly because then the USB down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner will start recognizing the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the green light will come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you know the 64-bit driver
is installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next step of setup is getting the
calibration files moved over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's close this folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's go back to home on our jump
drive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the SW, SW1 folders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our two calibration files right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are our two files.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to move those underneath the
program files for StellarNet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm going to come down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple methods to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will just go ahead and right click
here, open up another file explorer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go to my C drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go to program files,
just plain program files.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to go to StellarNet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's right up here is the
directory if you're looking for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then SpectraWiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the folder I need to move
these to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come back over to my StellarNet spec
jump drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my califiles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to highlight them with
Shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can copy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can drag and drop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says move to SpectraWiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just dropped them over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says you need to provide this to
move this folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So move those two folders over to our
program files StellarNet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are all set there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually ready to look at the
software and open that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just find it here in my program file.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called SWD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will right click on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to right click on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come to run as administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we'll notice is we do see
the curve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing light coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go through each
individual icon around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some important ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that dark scan one we were looking
at here a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the important things we should
recognize as we're looking at our setting
[SPEAKER_00]: up here first is our value and our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's our set detector,
integrator detector time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our value just kind of shows us that
it is seeing some counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we go deep into that,
let's talk about initial setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our initial setup, we click the
setup up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, refer to the manual for a lot
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Detector integration time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that here in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before, just to make sure that
everything's set up correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's come down here to interface port and
detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's click there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just verify that everything's
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: CCD 2048, if you'll remember from our spec
sheet on the PowerPoint slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is what all three of our units are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: USB cable, that is how we're connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: LT16 digitizer, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blue wave spectral.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those are checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it automatically recognized that from
plugging it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're set there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll exit that setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing we're going to look at is unit
calibration coefficients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should have already recognized
these units as well, but let's just check.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where do I find the calibration
coefficients for my unit?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually right on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see where it says C1,
C2, C3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, it says select channel 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hit Enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to give me a number that
matches C1 exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit Enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: C2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to match C2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And C3 is going to match C3.
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 is 0 because there is no fourth
calibration unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that that's all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other thing you may notice when
you're first setting it up is that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of warning messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can turn that on and off right here
from Setup, Warning Message Enable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes they're helpful when
you're learning the unit to walk through,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes you find them just in the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can turn those on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through our first steps of
each measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one is setting the integration
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get the integration time up to
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we can do, we can use this
little slider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can slide this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see it jumped up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it changed our integration time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says 8.52 down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't look like quite enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can maximize out our little bar here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says 1,000 milliseconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not quite to the top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our sliding bar isn't going to get it
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we come over here to Setup,
Detector Integration Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just type in 1,500 to see if
that is too high or if that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can go a little bit
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go Setup, Detector Integration
Time, 1,700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it takes a little bit of
experimenting so that you can get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pops up, and then it always comes right
back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty close to the top without
touching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see it flat anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next stage, now that we've set the
integration time, is the dark scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to take the cap, put on top of
the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it drops down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see a few little noise spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we click the dark scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it drops to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw the value go to zero as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we know it's successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a dark scan, and it saved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we open that up, and it pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit smoother on a couple spots,
but it is showing us what the light is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'd expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we wanted to, you can do this drag
and drop if you want to focus on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to cut your wavelengths down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we're only interested in 350 to,
let's say, just above 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by clicking on that, it just
shortened the X range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our X value is down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to get rid of that, I just hit
the zoom info right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boom, I hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes me all the way out to the
full range of the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I can just drag and drop that
if I want to look at that a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: closer and get that smaller wavelength
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next step is we want to see what
this looks like in terms of a unit of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, micromoles per meter
squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's come up here to view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to radiometer mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want micromoles per square meter
per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's going to give me this
warning message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this isn't what you were
calibrated to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not under my calibration lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm under the lights I changed it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's now going to give me the
intensity at each wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yours might be much smaller than
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we would change to see our
graph on different levels is we would go
[SPEAKER_00]: to that view y scale set max y.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing most of yours is probably
something like this set at 10 instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's 10 micromoles per meter
squared per second over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to go to view y scale set max
y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just go to 0.5 because it is so
different here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it gives us a better scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then at this point, let's save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or actually, actually we're thinking to
ourselves, you know, maybe I'm curious
[SPEAKER_00]: about the intensity out here to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we wanted to change, the par
range is set at 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I wanted to see some of that far
red and see the amount of micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared per second out here,
I can go to view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I set up range for watt and our flux
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one's 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll leave that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second one, let's change that to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to see this value go
up 7.26.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we added about a quarter more of
micromoles per meter squared per second to
[SPEAKER_00]: go all the way out here to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and save this sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go to file, save.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just saving it to the desktop
for our example right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will save it as light sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to save it as a .irr file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we save that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can change this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different than what your zoom mode
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually setting the export
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for ours, we'll just set it at 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do wavelength increment of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it did take it all the way out
there to the max of 1,100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we have those samples saved,
let's just show a quick tool on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at these graphs in spreadsheets or in
Excel so we can see how they graph out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we'll go ahead and do is we'll
just open up a blank Excel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I just have a blank Excel open
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the light sample spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to drag this over and
drop it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opens up in a new window.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just doing a quick analysis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to click on data because we
need to get this to text to columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, we need to highlight it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we highlight column A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Text to columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delimited, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can already see down here on data our
nanometer wavelength here and then our
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity in terms of micromoles per meter
squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we want those in separate columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for fun, let's rename this
nanometers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's rename this micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to hit control down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to hit shift over,
control shift up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it comes up with this nice little
quick analysis tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to click on charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to do line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have a very quick analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can see we can now analyze it using
Excel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, that concludes our video
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned something.
