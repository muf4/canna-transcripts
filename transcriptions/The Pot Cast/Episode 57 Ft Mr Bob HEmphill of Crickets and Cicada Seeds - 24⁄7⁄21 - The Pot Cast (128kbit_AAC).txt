more without further ado let's get into it
[SPEAKER_00]: alrighty so a big thank you and welcome to
the next guest on the show one half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic mastermind behind crickets and
cicada we're lucky to be joined again by
[SPEAKER_00]: the librarian himself mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Hemphill thank you so much for joining
us today thanks for having me I'm really
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to talk with you it's been a while
and it's always good time hell yeah the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing I want to know what have you
been smoking on recently um today I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been smoking on the HP 13 lazy dog cross
mostly a little bit of the Brutex too oh
[SPEAKER_02]: nice some of the new releases yeah yeah
for sure I'm really happy with the way
[SPEAKER_02]: they turned out those two are really
killer and what sort of high do they have
[SPEAKER_00]: is it like a more sort of functional one
or like more sedating so for me it's
[SPEAKER_02]: functional I like to smoke them during the
day but they can be a bit overwhelmingly
[SPEAKER_02]: potent even for me you know both of those
have a little bit of sativa in there the
[SPEAKER_02]: Brutex is probably like 1 8th why and
sativa through the sensei star and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know me and you were talking last time we
talked we were talking about the HP 13 and
[SPEAKER_02]: I had mentioned that I'd always heard that
it was just a land race hash plant hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant number 13 well I made that comment
recently on Instagram and somebody sent me
[SPEAKER_02]: a DM I don't know if they want to be put
on the spot here but so I won't throw
[SPEAKER_02]: their name out but they uh mentioned that
they had heard a story that the HP 13
[SPEAKER_02]: originated in Arizona and the mother was a
tie that was called Victoria and they they
[SPEAKER_02]: needed a indicator short enough the
flowering time it was a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: brotherhood guys that had met in Oaxaca
and I guess in the story I heard was on an
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian reservation in Arizona they bred a
whole bunch of indicas on the Victoria tie
[SPEAKER_02]: clone and that's the source of the HP 13
seeds I don't know if that's accurate or
[SPEAKER_02]: not and when I heard it I really like took
it with a grain of salt but after I grew
[SPEAKER_02]: out a bunch of the HP 13 crosses I saw a
few of them that did have the the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: structure of tie where they fox tailed up
into a point and um it really made me uh
[SPEAKER_02]: you know kind of think that that story
might be true because you know people tell
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and plants tell the truth I like
that statement that's a good one I'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember that I mean the HP 13 is
really interesting because for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been you know all these various
rumors about it and one that I find comes
[SPEAKER_00]: up regularly is that it's somehow tied
into either Skelly or the chem dog or just
[SPEAKER_00]: through you know some sort of common
linkage to the chem dog basically would
[SPEAKER_00]: you say that given what you've just
mentioned that you don't think that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: case well I had the HP 13 back in the day
and um that was I think I ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: dropping her in 2006 because of uh
couldn't get the PM on over and I got the
[SPEAKER_02]: copy again about a year and a half ago and
it's the same copy it's um I got it from
[SPEAKER_02]: lion tree and um you got it from a friend
in Maui and that the copy I'd gotten 15
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago was from another friend that had
gotten in from Maui and they were the same
[SPEAKER_02]: cut and you know when I remember back from
2005 you know um I've actually you know
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned a lot in the last 15 years so
it might be related to the same family of
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plants that um the puck is from and
the um pacific northwest but um it just
[SPEAKER_02]: might be you know the same type of uh
terpene profile and you know the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: structures are pretty similar but the the
HP 13 has a much bigger inner node stretch
[SPEAKER_02]: than the puck or the pacific northwest so
I would think maybe the the afghani family
[SPEAKER_02]: from the pacific northwest and the HP 13
might be you know similar family and from
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan but I don't think there's any
direct lineage I think the HP 13 probably
[SPEAKER_02]: um predates the chem 91 by quite some time
and HP 13 has such a unique terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile I've never really encountered it
in any other cannabis um and it really
[SPEAKER_02]: throws that in its crosses I bred um a
four-way sour diesel great white sharp
[SPEAKER_02]: cross to it in 2005 and um those HP 13
terps uh really dominate stuff and um you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I see that again this this cross and
the lazy dog male is uh really throws a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain qualities um strongly so it was
able to impart some really good qualities
[SPEAKER_02]: into the HP 13 where you get the bigger
bud structure and you get really strong
[SPEAKER_02]: strong potent weed and then the HP 13
added some of those really cool terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: in there and they're just so unique and
you know you can't miss them I really
[SPEAKER_02]: doubt that it's actually part of um cam or
the the puck like directly related yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: okay what a what a good rundown there I
think the other thing I'd heard about the
[SPEAKER_00]: HP 13 was that it might somehow be tied in
to the maui dog which is another one which
[SPEAKER_00]: you know often gets sort of linked into
all the chem stuff what's your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_00]: the HP 13 and the maui dog is it the same
in that maybe there's a similar bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: afghanica there but they're probably not
related or where do you see those two in
[SPEAKER_02]: relation to each other so I actually got
the maui dog came along with the HP 13 for
[SPEAKER_02]: the ride and um there's a few different
maui dogs in mali um there's the maui
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk dog uh there's the west side maui
dog and then there's this one so there's
[SPEAKER_02]: at least two or three of them and um this
one is uh chem 91 bag seed most likely an
[SPEAKER_02]: s1 you know not so dog said it probably
came from his grow or the person that held
[SPEAKER_02]: down the 91 and brought it out from the
east coast one of their close friends and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was taken over and um popped in maui
and that that that really uh you know
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it when you grow the plant you know
it's a chem 91 s1 there's no hawaiian
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa or any skunk in there anything like
that which would be the other maui dogs
[SPEAKER_02]: like not so dog had a maui dog he he bred
with the mass super skunk and uh chem 91
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's not it this is just a a bag
seed you know it's you know one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: strains like headband or something else
where there's several different strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that go by the same name so that causes a
mass confusion but um I bred the lazy dog
[SPEAKER_02]: male to the maui dog and I also brought
him back to the chem 91 that made a chem
[SPEAKER_02]: 91 back cross and I grew the back cross
out and I grew the maui dog out and um so
[SPEAKER_02]: so similar and um the maui dog um is such
a good ass one that really amplifies the
[SPEAKER_02]: those good chem 91 qualities that it
actually probably turned out better than
[SPEAKER_02]: the back cross so um got me thinking and
I'm like wow if it is a s1 that would make
[SPEAKER_02]: the maui dog go back to the chem 91 two
times and then the lazy dog goes back to
[SPEAKER_02]: it once so that would make it go back to
the chem 91 three times and a very close
[SPEAKER_02]: you know two three generation pedigree and
um where the back cross is only twice so
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that kind of makes sense that it
would be more true to type because it's um
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding forwards instead of breeding
backwards because the maui dog really like
[SPEAKER_02]: I said amplifies some of the best
qualities that the chem 91 can produce wow
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really interesting and it sort of
brings us to another question that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask you about have you had any
success or further developments in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of sort of trying to reinvigorate the chem
or do you think like what you just said
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's maybe better just to use the
maui dog going forward given it's you know
[SPEAKER_02]: arguably better well you know as far as
we're working a pure chem line I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to leave that to lucky dog and top dog I'm
more you know just breeding for a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: type of plant that I remember in the 90s
and um I thought adding the chem 91 to the
[SPEAKER_02]: nl hash plant you know not necessarily
breeding for pedigree but more breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: for a certain type of plant um and that's
the reason I hit it to the sensi star next
[SPEAKER_02]: um just breeding for a certain type of
plant and you know I believe the sensi
[SPEAKER_02]: star and the chem 91 both go back to nl so
it's you know um in my opinion the best nl
[SPEAKER_02]: around you know um even though it's not
the purest it's just kind of like the best
[SPEAKER_02]: examples of what I remember of good nl
weed from the mid to early 90s and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know that's what I was just trying to um
lock in those genes um from those old cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: you know the sensi stars from the mid 90s
too and I believe sensi stars mother was
[SPEAKER_02]: garlic bud and the father was nl hawaiian
and um you know I think garlic bud is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably part of chem 91 too maybe garlic
bud hash plant skunk type of thing would
[SPEAKER_02]: give you something very similar to chem
dog yeah that's a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis there because I've been sort of
debating the question in my mind about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we ever will find out the real
story behind chem dog it seems like most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the origins have been chased as far as
you can take them and it's still not
[SPEAKER_00]: really yielding the answer but something
that I wonder which you just brought up is
[SPEAKER_00]: like what are the genetics in the chem dog
in your mind that give it that stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of people and I think we've
discussed this ourselves just when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out that you know the the
similarities between skelly or even the
[SPEAKER_00]: pnw are very present you know there's that
similar flavor profile and effect but the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about the chem dog that always
tripped me up was how stretchy it is
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to a lot of the plants that often
get said you know this is maybe apparent
[SPEAKER_00]: this is maybe apparent do you think that
maybe in the the combination you just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned with the garlic bud the hash
plant the skunk that maybe it's the skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: that brings that stretch or do you think
it's some weird combination which just
[SPEAKER_02]: brought it out when it wasn't expected
yeah um you know I'm not an expert on
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk but um you know I think skunk's got
quite a bit of columbian and you know um a
[SPEAKER_02]: few others sativa's mixed with the uh
afghani so um chem 91 definitely besides
[SPEAKER_02]: the stretch it has the um the the way the
flowers um will just keep getting wider
[SPEAKER_02]: and wider in the center the bud is right
you know at eight and a half weeks but if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at the outside the um it'll
keep going until 77 days um you know
[SPEAKER_02]: certain people notice that it's actually a
test higher and has better terpenes at
[SPEAKER_02]: about eight and a half weeks um you know
compared to like 10 or 11 weeks so um the
[SPEAKER_02]: way that the that just keeps uh putting
out and going around the bud is definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa qualities almost uh reminds me of
haze crosses that I've seen like nl haze
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses can kind of do that same thing
yeah that's so interesting because I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember I was talking to skunk va about
it and he said something to the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: he goes every now and again I wonder is
chem dog even a real syndica he goes
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I think there's sativa in there
he goes it's almost like kind of like what
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned with the lazy dog cross is
like it's just so potent that sometimes it
[SPEAKER_00]: tricks you into thinking it's a real heavy
indica but maybe it's not as heavy as we
[SPEAKER_00]: give it credit for it's just so potent
that it sort of knocks you down a bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like oh super indica um do you
think of it like that have you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: thought that maybe there's some sativa in
the chem I would say almost 100 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 25 percent and it just you know
carries those few qualities I wish we knew
[SPEAKER_02]: more about the history of cannabis you
know um people have always been trading
[SPEAKER_02]: silk road and the hippie trail all went
through there and people are always taking
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and spreading them around and really
don't know much about um history in Asia
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm sure there was a lot of uh people
moving from Southeast Asia and Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_02]: back and forth and um people take cannabis
with them that's what they do I wish we
[SPEAKER_02]: had a better um view of everything like
most land races have been ruined at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point and we only have glimpses here and
there of uh what there was and is left in
[SPEAKER_00]: some places yeah sadly that is the truth
isn't it I'm going to jump back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: silk road you just mentioned a minute ago
but before I get there I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly ask do you think we'll ever find
the true roadkill skunk and if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to try to find the roadkill skunk
where would you look what genetics would
[SPEAKER_00]: it be in pure skunk afghani or some sort
of mix um always looking for something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that and um I don't have it in my
arsenal I bred with the four-way so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different times I bred it to great white
shark in 98 I bred it to ak-47 bred it um
[SPEAKER_02]: and bred chem dog from south fork seed
serious um which was a mix of 707 seed
[SPEAKER_02]: banks uh 707 chem dog and star dog from jj
bred it to nl1 and it never really passed
[SPEAKER_02]: along those uh skunk qualities it passed
along a lot of other nice qualities but
[SPEAKER_02]: you know um I hope it's not a something
that's lost and it's just going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: mythical from here on out hopefully
someone has it in their gene pool and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll share it with the community yeah I
mean as someone who's never been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: try it I would I would certainly love to
see if it meets the hype or uh if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of one of those just fabled strains
from years ago but let's go back and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: state the obvious you know it's pretty
exciting times for you and Hannibal
[SPEAKER_00]: recently because since we last spoke a
number of years ago uh you've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of part ways from coastal and launch
your own brand crickets and cicada which
[SPEAKER_00]: has been met with a lot of success and
even more recently the the momentum behind
[SPEAKER_00]: your work has just been going off the
chain how have you been since we last
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke and how's the new company and what
have you been keeping yourself busy with
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been a wild ride since we last talked
um some lots of good times and some rough
[SPEAKER_02]: times and um you know I've just been
focusing mostly on working my lines that I
[SPEAKER_02]: like and Hannibal likes the most and about
a year ago I you know came out of you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like a little bit of uh depression funk
and I just really went full full blast on
[SPEAKER_02]: on the company um I had a good friend pass
away and you know kind of put me in a font
[SPEAKER_02]: for a few years and a couple other rough
things but um this support from the
[SPEAKER_02]: community has been tremendous and it's
really heartfelt and appreciated and even
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're just you know liking or
commenting on the instagram it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciated and um really cool to see
people uh interested in these old genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: and not just the same old um cookie family
um stuff and supporting us so we can
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to work these lines further and
hopefully uh bring out some really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff into the gene pool that hasn't been
there in seed form for quite a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah what a what a great insight into what
you've been doing recently and I I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: speak for everyone when I say we're glad
to hear your back kicking things in full
[SPEAKER_00]: swing just in a few questions ago you
mentioned the silk road and it brought up
[SPEAKER_00]: to mind that uh you released a strain
called the silk road which was the
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese hash plant crossed by the pnw
hash plant nl1 how did that go for you did
[SPEAKER_00]: it sort of bring some of the traits you
were looking to create to the forefront
[SPEAKER_00]: and will you possibly be working any more
strains like that so there's some really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool stuff to be found in that cross the
red lebanese hash plant as you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing smoke super potent um the fact
that she's land race though she throws
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff all over the place so it's not my
most consistent strain which you know in
[SPEAKER_02]: my opinion that's a good factor but
there's you know quite a few different
[SPEAKER_02]: phenols of the hash plant that can pop out
and then the nl hash plant side so it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool mix and if you you know f2
those there's going to be some crazy stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: uh popping out I have the red lab in the
breeding room right now with the puck back
[SPEAKER_02]: cross and I'm excited to grow those ones
out really excited about that one yeah wow
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant lovers wet dream right there
having both parents come from either side
[SPEAKER_00]: with that sort of genetic lineage I guess
the thing that I would be wondering is
[SPEAKER_00]: having been lucky enough to see the
Lebanese hash plant in your garden I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen that it's it's quite stretchy I mean
you know compared to say like the pnw hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or the skelly hash plant it's got a
lot of you know vigorous side branching
[SPEAKER_00]: really admirable traits and then you know
on the other side of the parental lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got the traditional hash plant you
know that totem pole kush do you expect
[SPEAKER_00]: people to find maybe a happy medium when
these two meet and cross paths or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you'll get some that are like mom
some that are like dad and in your mind is
[SPEAKER_00]: the ideal pheno the one in the middle or
is it just taking one or two traits from
[SPEAKER_02]: either side so you know with that f1
hybrid there I'm sure I'm expecting to see
[SPEAKER_02]: you know 30% leaning towards the the
mother the hash plant side 30% leaning
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the puck back cross and then you
know the other 30% being the blend you
[SPEAKER_02]: know f1s are you know if you're in the
hunting seeds and finding cool stuff man
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really cool because there's going
to be quite a mix in there and the red lab
[SPEAKER_02]: as you know has some amazing turps you
know turtsy roll um amazingness and like
[SPEAKER_02]: you said that the branching and the way
she can stack she gets a really big cola
[SPEAKER_02]: so she can add a lot of really nice
qualities to the mix and um I'm excited to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that one out and uh I put every hash
plant I had in there I put the nepalese
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant pacific northwest hash plant
put the puck in there through the bx2 um
[SPEAKER_02]: and a bunch of northern lights clones so
I'm excited about that one that's awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a whole bunch of avenues I
want to delve into with you off that one
[SPEAKER_00]: but before we move on I just want to
quickly ask because I've had a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: people ask me this would you be able to
give us a quick rundown on what you know
[SPEAKER_00]: of the backstory behind the red Lebanese
hash plant came from bamboo he got it from
[SPEAKER_02]: a relative of Tim Blake's I heard it was
Howard Marks stock so I don't know much
[SPEAKER_00]: besides that yeah wow I mean you don't
really hear about Howard Marks you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the for people listening the original Mr
Nice you don't really hear a lot about his
[SPEAKER_00]: personal seed stock but it makes sense
that there would have been some right that
[SPEAKER_02]: guy uh was a serious smoker smuggler um he
did a lot of smuggling in the US and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sure he uh spread genetics you know um
really big good dealers uh especially back
[SPEAKER_02]: then that was before my time even because
I know in my time in the 90s especially
[SPEAKER_02]: the dealers would you know get the good
cuts into the growers hands a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: time so that they could get that weight
you know so um I'm sure in Howard's time
[SPEAKER_02]: it was even more important for that type
of thing to happen yeah wow it makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: think like that's that's the seed stock I
want to go get my hands on somehow but
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway we'll move on I uh I wanted to fill
people in because I I'd noticed that the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of the new company crickets and
cicada it's a cool name and I'd actually
[SPEAKER_00]: heard that from a lot of different people
they thought it was like unique and like
[SPEAKER_00]: very different to the sort of names you
hear on the market nowadays and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you used to have a dog called cicada
beautiful girl had the pleasure of meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: once and I'm wondering slash guessing was
that the inspiration for the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand and if you might be able to give us
a bit of a rundown on where the name comes
[SPEAKER_02]: from yeah um I had a cat named cricket too
and um the the name is from a terrapin um
[SPEAKER_02]: crickets and cicada sing is the line in
the terrapin and I just put it uh crickets
[SPEAKER_02]: and cicada seeds um just keep it keep the
family names in there and then you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrapin Station is one of my favorite
songs of all time and Grateful Dead has
[SPEAKER_02]: been such a huge inspiration in my life
yeah that's awesome and I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to some Grateful Dead questions in a
little bit but I just wanted to quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: follow up one of our listeners had
requested to ask you if you had any tips
[SPEAKER_00]: on treating dogs with cannabis for example
what you might use the sort of dosages I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you've had a little bit of
experience with this do you have any
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations yeah it starts slowly and
uh work your way up and um you know if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can work with a lab you know get your uh
coconut oil tested to see how strong it is
[SPEAKER_02]: you know per weight and then you can know
how much you're dosing and work your way
[SPEAKER_02]: up and um it does amazing things with old
or injured animals but like I said it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very important to start slow and work your
way up because they can get pretty fucked
[SPEAKER_02]: up and where they where they can't walk
and they're just kind of like fucked up if
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't do that you know I've lived in
Humboldt County since 97 and I've heard of
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of and seen a lot of people's dogs
get into compost piles full of pounds full
[SPEAKER_02]: of buttered out ganja and they just get in
there and munch it and animals can become
[SPEAKER_02]: uh quite fucked up so make sure they don't
have access to large amounts like that
[SPEAKER_02]: because if they like it they'll eat it you
know especially if it's in butter coconut
[SPEAKER_02]: oil that's just an important tip right
there though because but I highly
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend it cook it in a crock pot use a
candy thermometer so you don't get it too
[SPEAKER_02]: hot strain it through a cheesecloth and
coconut oil cats will eat it dogs will eat
[SPEAKER_02]: it and um I've seen it extend years on the
animals lives and the quality of uh that
[SPEAKER_02]: the life of old animals is uh dramatically
increased they're not in pain walking
[SPEAKER_02]: around and they can sleep through the
night it's just amazing that's so awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear and just to clarify would you
recommend just THC or a mixture THC CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: because we see a lot of CBD brands
emerging that are trying to cater
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for animals and then finally
would you recommend them having a dose
[SPEAKER_02]: every day or like how frequently I
recommend one to one CBD to THC and um you
[SPEAKER_02]: really want high uh terpene strains really
matters in the healing effect and um you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to have a one-to-one strain you
can have THC strain and a CBD strain and
[SPEAKER_02]: just mix them 50 50 in there and then um
CBD is crucial and the THC is crucial I
[SPEAKER_02]: think they got to be in there together to
work uh really I'm sure CBD by itself
[SPEAKER_02]: would be good and THC by itself would
definitely be good but if you uh can mix
[SPEAKER_00]: them both it's far superior awesome stuff
so just to throw back to the grateful dead
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned another one of our guests
wanted to know what's your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dead show of all time or do you
have like a specific tour that you like
[SPEAKER_02]: more than one specific show so as far as
uh tapes and stuff I love 77 um that's one
[SPEAKER_02]: of my favorite years I got to see them
live myself in 93 and 94 and 95
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately I didn't graduate high
school in 90 until 94 so I got to see
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerry about 30 to 50 times and every
single time I saw him it was the most
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing thing you felt like he was talking
directly to you it's hard you know to get
[SPEAKER_02]: tickets back then it was really a struggle
everybody wanted to get in so when you
[SPEAKER_02]: finally did get in and you know he played
you know a touch of gray or something you
[SPEAKER_02]: really felt it you've I don't know he you
know some musicians are just amazing and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's you know the only way he can be
described as amazing I think everyone in
[SPEAKER_02]: the audience felt like he was talking
directly to them personally and uh the
[SPEAKER_02]: songs were telling the stories of
everybody's lives all in our own together
[SPEAKER_02]: very thankful I got to experience that my
lifetime what an awesome recount that's
[SPEAKER_00]: killer that's killer what's your thoughts
on people naming their strains after
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dead uh songs and I just guess I
wonder like when there's these really
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known song names and then you get a
strain and like maybe it's not a good
[SPEAKER_00]: strain like does that is that like a
bummer like I don't know I think every uh
[SPEAKER_02]: a grateful dead song name is already taken
up in strain form uh me and p-bud mike
[SPEAKER_02]: were actually uh texting today about this
laughing and joking I think it's a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: tribute to the band um hopefully people
don't start getting sued that's it right
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it in the age of being sued I mean
brings up a great point yeah I love
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting with you because you're like me
you often just lurk around on social media
[SPEAKER_00]: and so like you know maybe you're not
commenting on every post but I can bank on
[SPEAKER_00]: you having seen the post so my question is
what's your thoughts on turpogs and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting sued by skittles do you think it
was sort of had it coming or where do you
[SPEAKER_02]: sit you know um I think it was definitely
not going to be a hard decision for uh the
[SPEAKER_02]: judge to decide if it was uh infringement
or not um so that being said they probably
[SPEAKER_02]: you know didn't think of that when they
started their brand and their brand's
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing and you know it's an unfortunate
situation to be honest the way I see it
[SPEAKER_02]: especially uh since the you know the owner
of that candy company starting to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: the marijuana business it's just like
don't support that guy you know fuck that
[SPEAKER_02]: guy that's what you know that's all I
gotta say about that one yeah that is
[SPEAKER_00]: suspicious timing isn't it I think the
thing about the skittles situation which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me interested in it all is like sort
of two aspects a there was the matt rise
[SPEAKER_00]: incident of I believe 2015 where he got a
cease and desist from Nintendo after I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you remember back in the day every
oil company had like a Mario or a Bowser
[SPEAKER_00]: or a Peach or something on their labeling
and like Nintendo was the big thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of take characters from anyway he got
he was the first one I believe to receive
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of legal notification about the
use of another company's trademark so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's interesting that there's
already like a precedent um and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that came about before they found
skittles so that's interesting but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the more interesting part about the story
is the way they're reacting to it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like rather than sort of copping it
sweet and being like yep look we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to rebrand somehow you know a lot of
the posts seem to be like you know we made
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles everyone uses the Z in skittles
and like it's just sort of like not the
[SPEAKER_00]: approach I was expecting them to take have
you thought about that at all and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts on them when they're sort of
trying to lash out and say to everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: well you know everyone uses skittles in
their spelling we started this trend blah
[SPEAKER_00]: blah blah like is that gonna go anywhere
yeah what's your thoughts you know it's uh
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's uh I wouldn't be acting like
them that's for damn sure um but you know
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I don't get a cease and desist for
crickets and cicadas at some point
[SPEAKER_02]: there'll be a below not just to the
company but you know the Grateful Dead you
[SPEAKER_02]: know that the band that used to let
everyone tape their shows for free that
[SPEAKER_00]: they could spread the music for free you
know yeah okay good answer good answer so
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been interested to ask you you're a
passionate organic grower like myself like
[SPEAKER_00]: many people we've had on the show I like
that you're always pretty up-to-date with
[SPEAKER_00]: the newest trends and the going-ons of the
organic world is there anything new you've
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing in your garden in regards to
growing or maybe amendments or inputs that
[SPEAKER_02]: are sort of new compared to the last time
we spoke um I've implemented the Vitamixer
[SPEAKER_02]: into my game and it's been really cool so
I bought for the last 10 or 15 years when
[SPEAKER_02]: I have extra male plants I always feed
them to the the crop when I call them out
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to put them in an extraction bag
and and soak them in water overnight when
[SPEAKER_02]: I brewed my dragonfly earth medicine and I
would uh rub the bag to help extract but
[SPEAKER_02]: um about a year and a half ago I started
cutting them up and sticking them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Vitamixer and just blending it to juice
and then adding that onto my water and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're responding even better to that
also do nettle and horsetail and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: loving that and aloe vera just put aloe
vera leaves in there and some water and
[SPEAKER_02]: grind it up and then add that to my uh you
know I'm watering with a trash can right
[SPEAKER_02]: now with a sub pump on the bottom that
circulates the water around to keep it all
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed up nice and um you know I wouldn't
recommend doing that every feeding but a
[SPEAKER_02]: few times per trip uh with those uh
ingredients I just named it had been
[SPEAKER_02]: really helpful to my uh old regiment which
is mostly uh earthworm castings and
[SPEAKER_00]: compost nice and are you at the end of a
cycle are you pulling the soil out and
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing it up and mixing new amendments in
or are you sort of that more traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: no to where you just top dress a few
things and chuck the new plant in gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: work with the lab and send it in um and
whatever the lab says and it's done I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: do it if it doesn't need any major
adjustments I'll leave it in the pot two
[SPEAKER_02]: or three times you know sometimes I'll
need to get them all out and flush them
[SPEAKER_02]: and add certain ingredients to get
everything proper ratios or get cal mag
[SPEAKER_02]: ratios proper and whatever you know like
you you can shoot from the hip and just
[SPEAKER_02]: throw in it you know a handful of this a
handful on that and you know you can kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of get good at doing that but you'll never
be as good as uh sending them to a lab and
[SPEAKER_02]: working with a lab and having them tell
you what you need to add to your soil yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly I think that what you said is
just so true isn't it like you with time
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get good at having an idea of what
you need but the true sort of clear
[SPEAKER_00]: picture in the situation is doing a lab
test and adjusting and there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways you can do that I mean in
Australia obviously lab tests aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized very often for almost anything
like I mean so so you can get tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure but like I mean cannabinoids and
stuff like that like you just can't get it
[SPEAKER_00]: tested but what's interesting is I've um
I've spoken to people about the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: do their soil tests and there's a lot of
diversity some people say they've got 10
[SPEAKER_00]: pots like they might order 10 tests but
that's going to be quite expensive after a
[SPEAKER_00]: while if you're doing it regularly and
then I spoke to someone else and they said
[SPEAKER_00]: oh nah like I'll just test one pot every
so often that I think is like a sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: benchmark and then someone else told me a
cool idea where they say they get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: sample from each pot and mix it together
and send that in and then if it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good they just leave it but if something
needs to be changed they'll then pull all
[SPEAKER_00]: the root balls out like all the soil out
mix it all together fix it and put it back
[SPEAKER_00]: together long story short I know I know
that just took a long time to explain the
[SPEAKER_00]: question is how do you get your soil
tested do you just test one of them or
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you do yeah a little bit from a
bunch of different pots and mix it all
[SPEAKER_02]: together and I think that'll give you the
best picture so you know obviously some
[SPEAKER_02]: strains are going to pull certain
nutrients out of there harder certain
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are getting bigger and they're
going to use the nutrients more than
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller plants you know even of the same
variety but um you know you just can't
[SPEAKER_02]: send out a million samples to the lab you
know you just got to kind of mix a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of everything together and then
shuffle it up and then send that to the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab would be my best advice to anybody out
there sure and the final little bit on
[SPEAKER_00]: organics for the moment is do you try to
have your soil full of nutrients and ready
[SPEAKER_00]: for the coming cycle such that you're
really just sort of watering only with the
[SPEAKER_00]: occasional tea or do you like the idea of
sort of periodically top dressing and
[SPEAKER_00]: always having things in a state of
breaking down and releasing nutrients I
[SPEAKER_02]: like um a really rich soil but not so rich
that you only give it water I like to feed
[SPEAKER_02]: it teas and top dress and hit the plants
with certain you know food regiments at
[SPEAKER_02]: certain times to to get the results that I
like out of them so you know as a lately I
[SPEAKER_02]: like popping my seeds in a royal gold
king's mix and four inch pots and then I
[SPEAKER_02]: mix them I let them go in that for about
three or four weeks uh straight water
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the last few feedings I'll mix in
some calamac and then I'll uh move them up
[SPEAKER_02]: to a two gallon and my custom soil my
custom soil is uh too hot for seedlings um
[SPEAKER_02]: there it's just uh it's too much but even
with that I still like to top dress and
[SPEAKER_02]: feed them with teas because I use uh
smaller pots three to five gallons and I
[SPEAKER_02]: really uh put them as close to the lights
as possible and you know they eat the food
[SPEAKER_02]: up that way really hard and fast so that's
just the method that's worked for me best
[SPEAKER_00]: uh over the years um what a good rundown
we'll have to implement that next cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves one of the biggest sort of
pieces of feedback I received about our
[SPEAKER_00]: first episode was how grateful people were
about the depth of detail you went into
[SPEAKER_00]: with your ipm regimen and I think people
have been able to successfully use that
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves I guess it makes me wonder you
know are you still the ipm king you still
[SPEAKER_02]: kick an ass each cut you get yeah I mean
you gotta um be on your ipm game if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna keep these mothers around that's for
sure you know I sell for his king still um
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also doing a um another mix with uh I
use an ounce or two per gallon of uh
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol the um 99.9% mix that with uh
plant therapy an ounce or two per gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: an ounce of Dr. Bronner soap per gallon
some essential oils and uh you know maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: a quarter ounce per gallon and alternate
your essential oils and that one's been
[SPEAKER_02]: treating me real nice lately knocks out a
bunch of stuff and um doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: bother the plants too much the only thing
in there that really bothers the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the essential oils just make sure
it's not too hot when you're spraying you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to be doing it you know above
90 degrees you want the lights to be off
[SPEAKER_02]: um you don't want the fans blowing on the
plants too hard either or until they dry
[SPEAKER_02]: out for a few hours but uh between that
and the micro nine sulfur you're pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: golden awesome what a nice little rundown
of the the volumes and ingredients right
[SPEAKER_00]: there I noticed that neem oil was missing
off the list have you decided to take a
[SPEAKER_02]: step away from neem oil you know um I'm
getting the results with this mix that I
[SPEAKER_02]: just mentioned the only thing that I don't
like is the you know plant therapy is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit expensive you know um I use it
as a part that's extra alcohol and extra
[SPEAKER_02]: soap really and extra essential oils
really uh makes it really potent you know
[SPEAKER_02]: I spray with a paint sprayer you know if
you spray that every day for uh 12 days
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna get rid of any problem you
have and um you know if you then clean the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants off for a week and then alternate
with sulfur you're definitely not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: have any problems I like to do that
treatment once a year you know switch in
[SPEAKER_02]: between but you gotta give a week in
between you know spray the plants off with
[SPEAKER_02]: uh yucca and aloe and coconut with the
paint sprayer just water you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: that sulfur to react with the oils and get
a bad burn oh yeah that would I can
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine the plants being very unhappy with
that a question I commonly get asked which
[SPEAKER_00]: is a tough one to answer so I'm interested
to your perspective is what should someone
[SPEAKER_00]: do if they're growing organically and want
to adhere to you know proper organic
[SPEAKER_00]: practices so not using pesticides things
like that what should they do if like in
[SPEAKER_00]: week four of flower they notice like a
mite problem I guess the question sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: revolves around should they spray
something should they not spray something
[SPEAKER_00]: are there better options how do you go
about battling a week four flower
[SPEAKER_02]: infestation week four infestation is a
rough one you know ideally you want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: uh inspecting your garden really
thoroughly in those first few weeks and
[SPEAKER_02]: not having an infestation at week four so
you would notice earlier at that stage you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's uh you know your personal meds
so it's going to be your personal choice I
[SPEAKER_02]: know uh plant therapy advertises that you
can spray uh their product uh till the day
[SPEAKER_02]: of harvest you know I obviously wouldn't
want to do that personally but if I had um
[SPEAKER_02]: um week four I think I would probably
attack them with the plant therapy the
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol and the Dr. Bronner soap with some
essential oils um spray them three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: days in a row with that and um they would
probably be relatively uh clean a month
[SPEAKER_00]: later yeah okay so you sort of have the
opinion and I think I agree with this that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just sort of trying to just get
through till the end of harvest as best
[SPEAKER_02]: you can yeah yeah for sure I think if you
hit them you know you're you know four
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks in if you hit them with that make
sure I told you four days in a row you
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd put a hurting on them um if you went
as far as 10 days in a row you'd kill any
[SPEAKER_02]: uh spider mites or micro mites with that
um the two ounces per gallon of alcohol
[SPEAKER_02]: just dries out their eggs and they're
they're not going to make it through that
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah great tip there a great tip so before
we got into the IPM you made the comment
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you got to you got to stay on top
of the bugs if you're going to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: library like you do and so I'm wondering
are there any new additions to the library
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're particularly happy or excited
to have been able to pick up you know I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: still excited about that HP 13 and that's
the one I had mentioned last time that I
[SPEAKER_02]: had wanted the most and um with the way it
crossed the lazy dog I'm very thankful
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was able to get reunited and um
very excited to see her cross with the
[SPEAKER_02]: puck back cross so that should be really
cool too um you know I got so many cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really hard for me to think of them
all you know I get into the uh other room
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like oh look at this one this
one's badass and then I get to the next
[SPEAKER_02]: one behind it I'm like oh yeah this one's
fucking badass you know like when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: showing someone around oh this one's even
fucking better over here you know uh the
[SPEAKER_02]: nl2 cut that Bodhi passed me that he got
from Jim Ortega you know to have something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that in the library amazing I'm
really excited to see that clone get
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed to the puck back cross um Kevin
Geordi just told me to come down um pick
[SPEAKER_02]: up a clone he wanted to see it and the
puck back cross it was uh Alaskan
[SPEAKER_02]: Thunderfuck from uh Dutch Blooms he said
that's a really killer uh pine plant so
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about that one that one's in
the puck back cross too um my friend Gabe
[SPEAKER_02]: shared with me this killer nl clone um his
friend has been holding on to it for 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years his friend got it uh in the late 90s
in Humboldt county um it was an old clone
[SPEAKER_02]: at that point he got it as nl I first uh
got samples of it a few years ago at
[SPEAKER_02]: Thermal Cup I showed it to AK Beanbrains
and AK Beanbrains and I both thought it
[SPEAKER_02]: had uh the nl5 in there and then um I saw
Kevin Geordi post about that old nl clone
[SPEAKER_02]: recently about a month ago and he thought
it was nl5 too so it's most likely nl5 but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's um when he made his post he was
talking about have we really improved
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in you know the last 20 or 30
years because this clone is of such high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality has such a amazing uh you know
crystal covered that's in reality we
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't really done much to improve
cannabis in the last 20 or 30 years and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically uh trying to get all these
uh awesome clones I have in a seed form
[SPEAKER_02]: have the building blocks out there so some
people in the future can improve cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like these uh old building blocks
are going to be essential to it at some
[SPEAKER_02]: point when we realize that the cookie wave
is not the ultimate cannabis plant and um
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just hoping I can uh you know add some
gene pools that some breeders will be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to take stuff to the next level with that
would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice answer there I mean so many
avenues to go off the first one I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to quickly ask you that nl2 Bodhi
gave you is that does that one have like
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thinnish leaves?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the more indica one he had two of
them passed uh from Jim Ortega to him and
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the more indica one Bodhi knows
what I like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay yeah last time I was at his place I
think I tried the thinner leaf one um and
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't like warn me it just it sat me
down on my ass so hard and I was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck was that he's like oh that's
nl2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it's some fucking uh it's good weed
uh I had a friend of mine uh Kanza got it
[SPEAKER_02]: uh lab tested and it has a real strong
pine lemon and that it's that old school
[SPEAKER_02]: you know pine not that turpentine pine
it's that you know pine tree pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah okay I mean yeah so many places we
can go from I guess just kind of building
[SPEAKER_00]: on where you said you know you want to
build some lines that maybe people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future can use to improve things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a bit about some of the more
recent males you're working with I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you've mentioned the lazy dog a few times
now what sort of traits and flavors can
[SPEAKER_00]: people expect that male to bring to
crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash planty gas um not your normal gas
it's uh a more hash planty northern lights
[SPEAKER_02]: um indica gas it's uh something I'm really
happy with and I'm really proud of
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the way it uh nicked with the
the the sensi star across the Brutus X um
[SPEAKER_02]: you know we were uh starting a search
through that um smoke smoke testing them
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're like holy shit we had about
eight of them and we're like wow none of
[SPEAKER_02]: these are culls they're all fucking
amazing and then we opened jar 13 and holy
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking shit this weed is as loud and as
potent as anything I've ever seen in my
[SPEAKER_02]: entire life and I'm like wow I think this
thing's so good uh that you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be easy to call some of those um
we're just going to keep about four of
[SPEAKER_02]: them to have a second look at um one of
them being a a garlic bud leaner which was
[SPEAKER_02]: uh my favorite plant the whole time
through and uh it's kind of like the sensi
[SPEAKER_02]: star mother was a garlic bud leaner most
of the sensi star cuts lean towards the
[SPEAKER_02]: hawaiian nl side and um this sensi star is
a rare one and um yeah she produced mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: the anahawaiian side and which is amazing
because it it clicked really really well
[SPEAKER_02]: with the lazy dog but I popped a whole
bunch more Brutex seeds already and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: looking through them you know I'm curious
to see how rare that garlic bud fino is in
[SPEAKER_02]: there because I only saw it once in about
20 seeds I mean you've got me wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: now what was garlic bud like was it the
same kind of garlic as what we see in GM
[SPEAKER_00]: oh or like was it just like an indica gmo
or what what are your recollections of it
[SPEAKER_02]: so when ben donkers came in after you know
neville got in trouble they changed the
[SPEAKER_02]: name to shiva shanta and um it's the same
strain and shiva shanta it's just it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: like one I don't know if I talked about in
the podcast but if one of the strains I
[SPEAKER_02]: grew in 96 was a shiva shanta clone my
friend gave me and god damn if I go back
[SPEAKER_02]: in time and get that fucking clone it
would be a game changer man this thing was
[SPEAKER_02]: you know had been around for a few years
already at that point 96 so you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably you know like the original drop
you know um when they changed the name but
[SPEAKER_02]: it was super high quality it's uh not too
much of that family around left around
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately interesting I mean do you
feel like maybe one of the reasons why you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see those strains around so much
anymore is because some of those prolific
[SPEAKER_00]: older ones that you mentioned were so
heavily adopted by the Amsterdam scene in
[SPEAKER_00]: those early years and all the seed
companies were just putting out bad
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of those strands such that they
just got lost or do you think they just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't stand up to more modern strains and
they got let go man it's really hard
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping clones around for all you know
years and years and years at a time and um
[SPEAKER_02]: no one can do it by themselves it takes a
group of people and a lot of stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: have has been lost in busts and stuff and
you know it's just it takes an insane
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of uh almost like crazy commitment
to keep stuff alive for as long as I have
[SPEAKER_02]: it's you know like a fucking crazy cat
hoarder that just you know takes
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and it keeps it forever yeah
okay well at least we know that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: any packs we get down the line will still
be using the real mothers if they come
[SPEAKER_00]: from you another question we got asked a
lot by the fans and I was wondering myself
[SPEAKER_00]: is what's new about the nl mail you've
picked this time you've written that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've selected a new mail from the
original seed stock have you been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out what the differences are between
this new one compared to the last one you
[SPEAKER_02]: used I think we might be confused there
because I actually tried to pop about uh
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 or 50 of the nl1 seeds talks about a
month ago and none of them went
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately I'm gonna go talk to kegu
about that one here soon um hopefully he
[SPEAKER_02]: can get some of his to go this lazy dog
mail is you know the grandson of that
[SPEAKER_02]: original northern one northern lights one
male that I picked and used for the
[SPEAKER_02]: original northern lights crosses and um
when I picked the nl hash plants I picked
[SPEAKER_02]: out of over just over 100 seeds I sprouted
I picked 15 females that I really liked
[SPEAKER_02]: and I kept them in small pots um for over
a year to see if any of them would
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-flower and any of them that did
pre-flower I called because that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest problem with the nl1 mail is he uh
would go into pre-flower himself and I
[SPEAKER_02]: heard a lot of people say I found a keeper
cut but it in veg under 18 hours a light
[SPEAKER_02]: it would just pre-flower and it would just
you know kind of veg like shit so it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't really worth keeping around at that
point so I really knew if I was gonna work
[SPEAKER_02]: that line I needed to get rid of that
trait then and there and I'm very proud of
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that uh I was able to get rid of
that you know um to eliminate a trait like
[SPEAKER_02]: that out of uh the gene pool um is
something I'm really proud of um hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take that success and you know
completely uh wipe out their mafredite
[SPEAKER_02]: traits but you know that's going to take a
few generations of work so I ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: using three nl hash plants when I made
those crosses and um two of more hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant leaners and one of them one is a nl1
leaner the lazy dog mail I picked I kept
[SPEAKER_02]: him around for a year before I used him to
tortured him in a small pot never showed
[SPEAKER_02]: signs of pre-flower he's almost identical
in structure and when I look back in
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of the nl1 to him he's they're
almost identical he just doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-flower so I'm really you know pleased
with that and pleased with him and um you
[SPEAKER_02]: know like I said I you know I kind of see
uh you know like the brood x is like the
[SPEAKER_02]: really good nl from the 90s the disc go
across the nl hash plant by the headband
[SPEAKER_02]: was also a very similar to the good
northern lights from the 90s you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: pedigree is not 100% pure but it's the
same type of plant so I feel like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: more important than just having a pure nl
gene pool it's more the type of plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting in seed form and producing
yeah what a great answer and you're 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: correct I made a mistake there but you
answered another question which was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically I was going to ask about the nl
so you just did it but the question I was
[SPEAKER_00]: meant to ask you is the new m10 male not
nl derp sorry um yeah you popped some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds recently and you've got a new m10
male can you give us the rundown on him
[SPEAKER_02]: okay so that m10 um it was an open
pollination there was 30 to 50 males used
[SPEAKER_02]: the only thing I called from the line was
a few true hermaphrodites um I got those
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the gene pool so it wasn't a pure
open pollination just was uh main goal was
[SPEAKER_02]: preserving the m10 line and um just like
original without crosses uh I this is
[SPEAKER_02]: second open pollination and it was five
years later so I like to get the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: every uh five years or so um those nl1
seeds that didn't pop those were uh 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years old so you know somewhere I haven't
started to really lose a lot of vigor and
[SPEAKER_02]: um from the first open pollination and
crosses I had done with m10 I had a idea
[SPEAKER_02]: of what it can produce and I threw a lot
of clones and this time that I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: would uh nick really well and we're really
happy with the results um the m10 by
[SPEAKER_02]: itself is um a sweeter afghani I feel like
uh from my experience with afghani lines
[SPEAKER_02]: there's either there's two forms there's
the acrid um earthy skunky afghanis and
[SPEAKER_02]: then there's the sweet um berry purple um
grape afghanis and um then 10 leans more
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the sweet side so you know I
thought that would click well and um with
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these other afghanis and it did
I'm really happy with the way the uh gan
[SPEAKER_02]: daddy turned out and the bubble gan um
there's some really really cool keepers to
[SPEAKER_02]: be found in that you know you don't see
afghanis like that much anymore in seed
[SPEAKER_02]: form I'm really proud to be bringing those
uh to the market you know if I was a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: buyer that's the type of shit I would be
scooping up you know and really cool weed
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes great super relaxing there's some
real winners uh to be found in the bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: gan and and again daddy both you know and
you know there's uh some really cool stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: for people to work lines from there's
gonna be uh I would predict a lot of uh
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders are gonna find cool shit to work
off you know all the different m10 crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: I did um it's great places to start
breeding projects um and work away from in
[SPEAKER_00]: different directions yeah wow what a great
answer I mean I love that you referenced
[SPEAKER_00]: the gan daddy because there was a few
things I noticed about it first of all as
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned it's got a nice little crew
of supporters on social media and with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the you know really nice photos you've
been posting over just beautiful it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to understand why but one of the big
things that stood out to me was that first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all it's the first granddaddy purple
cross in quite a while that's got a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum behind it and then the other
thing it made me wonder about is why do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think the granddaddy purple gets
overlooked so often I often hear people
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it like it's a crap version of
urkel whereas I always just thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of different what are your thoughts
about granddaddy purple and do you plan to
[SPEAKER_00]: work the gan daddy line forward at all or
do you think it's just nice as an f1 so
[SPEAKER_02]: there's quite a few questions there so I
believe the granddaddy is an urkel cross
[SPEAKER_02]: from Chris rest in peace I'd always heard
uh it was salmon creekbee big bud my urkel
[SPEAKER_02]: um when I'm seeing these urkel crosses
especially by the m10 I'm seeing nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: but broadleaf afghani in there that's what
the plants are telling me I've always
[SPEAKER_02]: really really loved the granddaddy purple
um I like it more than the urkel the urkel
[SPEAKER_02]: might be a little bit more flavorful um
the granddaddy's got more potency in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion you know when I'm cracking open
these uh gan daddy jars and sampling them
[SPEAKER_02]: to look for keepers it just brings me back
to 2002 you know it's like it's the early
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000s when humble you had to have purple
or you couldn't sell your bags that craze
[SPEAKER_02]: hit you know these are the type of weed
that would have done really well in that
[SPEAKER_02]: market in that time place um it's a
throwback like I said there's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool building blocks to be found in
there for breeders um I think cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely goes back to urkel if not
granddaddy you know look what dungeon fall
[SPEAKER_02]: has done with the all that work they did
off of ken's cut with uh ken back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day it's a really cool gene pool
especially when you uh were to take
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that and add it with the oh
geez or cookies or something there's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be some really cool stuff that's going
to come out of the modern bag of pills
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah that's that's an awesome answer and I
too like granddaddy a lot I think it um
[SPEAKER_00]: cost a bit of a bad rep sometimes not sure
why while we're talking about the m10
[SPEAKER_00]: though I wanted to quickly ask you I had
heard some rumors that UFO which was an
[SPEAKER_00]: old release from coastal seeds Romulan by
NL was in fact the line that alien
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics used to find a male that they
called peach had you heard this and did
[SPEAKER_00]: the UFO line give peach phenotypes that
you're aware of so um the nl1 male
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely threw peach he threw that with
the nl5 female I bred him to he bred
[SPEAKER_02]: through that to with quite a few different
females I've definitely heard that story
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's awesome when people use my
gear especially awesome when they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: change the name and give me credit there
you go diplomatic I love it so when you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear something like that we're someone's
doing really well with one of those lines
[SPEAKER_00]: does it ever make you think oh maybe I
should dig through that line a bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like obviously really good stuff
in there like I said earlier one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: main goals is not to be the best breeder
one of my main goals is to provide a
[SPEAKER_02]: really good gene pulls for the best
breeders and with every breeding I do
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a large
[SPEAKER_02]: factor in my head is what the females we
choose because we have a ridiculous amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of females and you can see when I do my
breedings I don't just throw them all in
[SPEAKER_02]: there I throw certain types that we're
hoping to get certain results and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my main results is potency and to
be able to retain that potency and seed
[SPEAKER_02]: form so that makes really good breeding
stock I like to breed as pure as possible
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's not already in the strain it's
being crossed to it's the same type
[SPEAKER_02]: generally so it's breeding for certain
types families and just to help deserve
[SPEAKER_02]: those qualities and gene pulls rather than
making crosses like you know I did with
[SPEAKER_02]: the m10 Malawi gold and m10 Ethiopian
banana and Ethiopian Panama red I am 10
[SPEAKER_02]: the goal and those breedings is to open
everything up and get craziness but most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the time when I'm breeding like them
tend to the black domino or those Afghanis
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're of similar types and I
feel like they'll neck well and preserve
[SPEAKER_02]: their qualities I wish I had hundred
different facilities and I was just
[SPEAKER_02]: driving around to them all day long and
doing different breeding projects I have
[SPEAKER_02]: so much work that I want to do in my head
I'll never be able to accomplish it in my
[SPEAKER_02]: lifetime you know I don't I don't cross it
together if I don't think it's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: provide something cool to work off of you
know and so I have so much shit I'll you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I'll never be able to get back to it
especially with me trying to preserve
[SPEAKER_02]: landrace and like I said I when I you know
do an open pollination I like to get back
[SPEAKER_02]: to it every five years so it's difficult
to decide what projects are most important
[SPEAKER_02]: and which ones I'm gonna get to next
because I got like ten of them in my head
[SPEAKER_02]: at least and so much old work that you
there's just amazing shit that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: can be worked out of them it's just hard
to leave them there and never go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: them yeah good answer good answer I mean
you just sort of referenced it yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: would you ever consider wanting to work
with bigger facilities or organizations in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to be able to you know do more
projects or do you like the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house mom-and-pop feel of the way you
do things I love the in-house mom-and-pop
[SPEAKER_02]: feel of the way Hannibal and I do things
she's the yin my yang and she sees some
[SPEAKER_02]: that I don't see and she's sees things
differently and her commitment to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: these clones is at times you know it's the
reason the collection is still here so I
[SPEAKER_02]: love that aspect of it just working with
us but um you know I would really love to
[SPEAKER_02]: see huge selections and I can't do that by
myself you know and especially if I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna work different projects you know
teaming up would be able to to get more
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff done and more stuff out to the
people which would be really cool but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a tough one and I most likely you
know I always say no to offers but the
[SPEAKER_02]: right one came along I might consider it
because you know you really want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking through hundreds of plants at a
time and for a mom and a pop to do that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost impossible you know we have 15
to 20 females off all the different types
[SPEAKER_02]: we just tested and you know I got a few
friends helping but you know it's up to
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah and I to smoke test them all
because we got to know what's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: there and it's a difficult job man even
you know you know I'm a tough fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker too I wake up and I fucking go for
the ball before I go for the toothbrush
[SPEAKER_02]: even with as hard as I smoke it's uh it's
tough to test that much weed and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep that many clones alive when we
funeral hunt it's it's it's really it puts
[SPEAKER_02]: us to the limits you know especially with
all the responsibilities we have so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be no minor undertaking that's
for sure so here's here's the hypothetical
[SPEAKER_00]: okay cookies comes to you and they're like
Bob we've got these huge facilities for
[SPEAKER_00]: you can you can do you can have a little
bit of freedom we're gonna be running like
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies cross m10 stuff like that do you
do it can you change the image no I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: and honestly you know I definitely if it's
not my way it's definitely the highway
[SPEAKER_02]: type of thing you know like I said I have
years and years of work and the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: different directions I can take you know
and the amount of sativa work I could get
[SPEAKER_02]: into and do would just be years worth of
work and with me you know it's in that
[SPEAKER_02]: problem about having the smoke test I'm
gonna keep with the Afghanis just for that
[SPEAKER_02]: reason because that's what I want to smoke
but um for I wish I could get into playing
[SPEAKER_02]: with sativas more just for the
preservation aspects because I have some
[SPEAKER_02]: really good sativas in my arsenal but it's
interesting you bring that up because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that there's some really nice ones in
there I actually wanted to ask you because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given some of these seeds to some
friends of mine who are gonna grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: out you gave me a cross called the Shire
cross Hayes and I remember you telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Shire and then I kind of forgot
the story I just remember like New York
[SPEAKER_00]: guys long flowering or something have you
ever been able to grow out those seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: what was the story around the Shire again
I haven't grown those seeds up the male
[SPEAKER_02]: was the a5 Hayes type bred by Karma that
Bodhi selected that was the father of the
[SPEAKER_02]: band Hayes that was the male I used for
that Shire is super silver sour diesel by
[SPEAKER_02]: the rat resdog selected in upstate New
York and highly coveted up there that's
[SPEAKER_02]: all they want to smoke she goes 100 days
120 days really really high quality smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it would pair well with the a5
Hayes tie I just gave that one away often
[SPEAKER_02]: to anyone that sends a sativa that's
around I'll pass that one out and had a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend grow it in Jamaica and he said it
was really good but besides that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think anyone's finished it and that male
produces gold so that female with being
[SPEAKER_02]: such high quality there's gonna be some
amazing stuff in there hopefully your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends find it Wow that's cool maybe
might even bring the flower time down a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit yeah that male is surprisingly
fast I've seen him I've crossed him to a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of things and I've seen out the
results from a lot of the others and that
[SPEAKER_00]: that male produces gold interesting well I
mean if we just loop back to the the silly
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies question I gave you a moment ago
partly why I brought it up is because I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like the offering you guys have
done with pastry chef I love the name cool
[SPEAKER_00]: name being biscotti cross the M10 what
does the biscotti bring to the table in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mind compared to say just another
cookie cut do you think it's sort of your
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred one or is it just one that
you're you know willing to put up with
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's slightly better than the
others so I keep cuts like that around to
[SPEAKER_02]: past friends of mine I just gave them to
them free so they can pay their bills
[SPEAKER_02]: production cuts that's how we did it in
the 90s we didn't sell cuts we gave them
[SPEAKER_02]: to friends that were good friends that
would do stuff for you if you were you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you needed someone to have your back
that's the type of person would have your
[SPEAKER_02]: back so you you give them you pass those
cones of those people so you know they can
[SPEAKER_02]: have a better life you know and that's how
we did it back then and that's the reason
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that one around that's the reason I
got the London pound cake around and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the reason I have the Sunset
Sherbert around I still give them to good
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and I got friends cropping them
and they're extremely high quality they're
[SPEAKER_02]: what the market on the West Coast wants
right now from their breedings the cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: fam those are some of my favorite ones
some of really high quality you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunset Sherbert's super high quality the
London pound cake is super high quality
[SPEAKER_02]: and biscotti super high quality it's not
what I want to smoke it's not the high I
[SPEAKER_02]: really like but you really can't deny the
quality you know I wouldn't cross them to
[SPEAKER_02]: the lazy dog or you know any of my other
worked lines but when it comes to a land
[SPEAKER_02]: race Afghani line that can add some really
cool sweet terpenes I thought it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting and I thought it would
teach me a lot so and that's the reason we
[SPEAKER_02]: did it we grew out some of the the sky
across ourselves super high quality we
[SPEAKER_02]: found one that tastes like pineapple pie
it's fucking crazy I've never even had
[SPEAKER_02]: pineapple pie and this this this one
tastes just like fucking pineapple pie
[SPEAKER_02]: really sweet not like the pineapple you
would get in a sativa it's a really unique
[SPEAKER_02]: indica pastry pineapple another
interesting note on the M10 biscotti
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses is they all went 10 weeks the M10
didn't shorten the flower time down one
[SPEAKER_02]: bit whereas I grew the Malawi gold M10 and
the Malawi gold will go 100 days those
[SPEAKER_02]: phenols were ready between 8 and 10 weeks
sure dramatically shortened the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: time on them but didn't shorten the
flowering time down on the London pound
[SPEAKER_00]: cake or Sunset Sherbert either Wow
interesting I guess this just something
[SPEAKER_00]: about the way those two sort of click
together in a similar sort of note I also
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask you about the dinosaur
cookies because that was another strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that had gotten a nice little bit of
attention behind it in some recent drops
[SPEAKER_00]: how did that one turn out in your opinion
and I guess more broadly speaking do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have any plans to do any new crosses with
the TK M10 male so um the dinosaur cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I was using the TK M10 male and I
you know wanted to learn you you were you
[SPEAKER_02]: came by and you saw all those samples and
you were like holy shit this is the most
[SPEAKER_02]: cookie f1s I've ever seen you know like
the cookie phenols are popping out you I
[SPEAKER_02]: think you got to look through like 15 or
17 jars and with you know you urging me on
[SPEAKER_02]: is one of the main reasons we released
that one it was super super high quality
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know it's not any direction that
I'm going to be working we did cross the
[SPEAKER_02]: TK M10 to the 92 og and I will be working
that line further those are some really
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice og phenotypes and seed form
right there and when I get the time I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to work that even further into the
og direction more of the earthy side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the family that's my preferred side the
you know like the headband or the TK wow
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting stuff that's cool to hear that
you're going to work that one forward a
[SPEAKER_00]: few episodes back we actually had green
Bodhi on and he spoke about a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: purple kush cutting he got from you and
he's just in love with it he said it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best thing ever and many of the listeners
on patreon were very interested in about
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing a little bit more about this
purple kush if you could sort of describe
[SPEAKER_00]: it to us and where does it come from I
think we always hear people say oh you
[SPEAKER_00]: know came from somewhere in Oregon but do
you know any more about it than that so
[SPEAKER_02]: the the common purple Hindu kush cut that
you're thinking about from Oregon is the
[SPEAKER_02]: the Jaeger cut and this is a different cut
than that this one's rapey citrus nog
[SPEAKER_02]: champa just funk and it's the one that I
bred to the Kabul Kush and then I took a
[SPEAKER_02]: male off of that and I bred it to the
Urkel and that's our release light of
[SPEAKER_02]: Venus Urkel by purple Hindu Kush Kabul
Kush I also crossed that purple Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: to the m10 and labyrinth tested those out
for us and they're gonna scoop all those
[SPEAKER_02]: up those are gonna be killer so I'm
definitely gonna grow some of those out
[SPEAKER_02]: myself when I get to it we only made like
a hundred packs of them so I think since
[SPEAKER_02]: they helped test them they're gonna scoop
them all up but um I have worked that line
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a bit I have the purple Hindu Kush
back cross I'm gonna be picking a male out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the purple Hindu Kush back cross taking
it to f2 and at this that time I'll cross
[SPEAKER_02]: it to all my purple Afghani clones that I
like like the Urkel granddaddy purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani stuff like that can people expect
you to be restocking any of these lines I
[SPEAKER_00]: know historically you've you've moved
forward quite fast if someone misses out
[SPEAKER_00]: on a pack of light of Venus will there be
a chance to grab more or only the real
[SPEAKER_02]: powerhouses will get restocked the line of
Venus was a stepping stone you know so
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna want to grab that it's been
going incredibly fast but we do have more
[SPEAKER_02]: drops coming with all the seed banks we
stock with hopefully everyone will get a
[SPEAKER_02]: chance to get some we have an amazing
keeper out of that she's just tastes so
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing and has such a nice relaxing high
so one of our good friends we gave a
[SPEAKER_02]: sample to and she was like holy shit name
this after me it's my favorite weed I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever smoked and of course another seed
company already has a strain named out
[SPEAKER_02]: with her name and you know it took us a
few months to come up with another name
[SPEAKER_02]: but Darcy came up with the light of Venus
and that's from a line in terrapin it's
[SPEAKER_02]: right before crickets and cicadas sing so
that won't get restocked but we will be
[SPEAKER_02]: working with the purple Hindu Kush back
cross which will bring more purple Hindu
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush to the table in the offspring and it
will be crossed back to the Urkel so it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be very similar I'll just have more purple
Hindu Kush the overkill won't get
[SPEAKER_02]: restocked overkill is one I'm really
really proud of too that was a stepping
[SPEAKER_02]: stone cross you know I used those I used
three males they were an L1 crossed the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific Northwest hash plant and I crossed
that to the puck three males out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: for the back cross to the puck and I
crossed that to the black Domina and
[SPEAKER_02]: release that and that won't get restocked
if you're an Afghani lover especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: you love the gene pools that Neville put
together especially if you're into the
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate earthy type musty basement with a
little bit of lemon type thing you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: scoop that one up it's it's killer you
look at a three generation pedigree you
[SPEAKER_02]: know on that thing and the top side you
get the puck Pacific Northwest hash plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'll one from my side and then
the black Domina you get Afghani number
[SPEAKER_02]: one and ten northern lights Ortega and
hash plant the Pacific Northwest hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant through Neville and there's some
serious serious killer stuff in there we
[SPEAKER_02]: looked through like 15 seeds and they were
so good we popped a whole bunch more
[SPEAKER_02]: already and you know they're gonna be sold
out and we're just looking through them
[SPEAKER_02]: for ourselves and for future breeding
stock it's just another one that really
[SPEAKER_02]: clicked well and we're really proud of and
you know that makes me really excited
[SPEAKER_02]: about the puck back cross because it's the
same males that were used yeah nice what a
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive rundown I'm I want to ask
you about the overkill in the kill in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit but before we do I just want to
quickly bring it up because I forgot to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention one of our listeners had asked if
you saw any relationship between your
[SPEAKER_00]: special purple Hindu Kush and Jaeger
because apparently they had heard a story
[SPEAKER_02]: that that was one of the parents of Jaeger
so um I don't know anything about that I
[SPEAKER_02]: got no knowledge on that I do this story
on the purple Hindu Kush I heard it was an
[SPEAKER_02]: old woman used to defend it in the two
fifteen days out in Shasta it's just land
[SPEAKER_02]: raise Hindu Kush it's not Hindu Kush
crossed by purple when I back crossed it
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already grown out a bunch of the back
crossed females there nothing in there but
[SPEAKER_02]: a Afghani so the story I heard the plants
telling me the exact same thing there's
[SPEAKER_02]: some really really cool things that comes
out of that plant lion tree grew some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the back cross out this year full season
it came out amazing one of them had this
[SPEAKER_02]: candied grape smell and then behind it it
had this funky oriental noodle smell
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the first time I noticed that and I
grew some of the purple Hindu Kush back
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed out and we found some really cool
candy grape ones found one that when you
[SPEAKER_02]: open the jar the jar stinks like peanuts
you can get that peanut butter smell from
[SPEAKER_02]: land-raised Afghani sometimes when you
smoke it you only taste candy delicious
[SPEAKER_02]: great jelly and you know I call that one
the peanut butter and jelly cut and I have
[SPEAKER_02]: it in cut form I haven't got the chance to
flower that one out again to see how if
[SPEAKER_02]: those qualities are still there cloned
form because sometimes seeds are better
[SPEAKER_02]: than clones for some strange reason but
I'm excited to get a second look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: one again yeah nice another question I
should have asked you a little bit earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: on when we were talking about older
strains and restocking them will you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: consider remaking any of those coastal
strains that you've made in the past like
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically one of our listeners wanted
to know about the puna butter I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't exactly your project but is there
any chance of any of those strains being
[SPEAKER_02]: redone or like filial bread I will never
redo any of the ones that bamboo or cake
[SPEAKER_02]: you did the peanut butter crosses was
bamboo work I tried to redo some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: nl1 like I said I tried to pop a bunch of
seeds and none of them popped I still have
[SPEAKER_02]: some more I'm going to you know try a few
different methods I'm going to talk to keg
[SPEAKER_02]: you about it I would really like to visit
nl1 crosses again there's a few things I
[SPEAKER_02]: would like to add in there to see some
cool results I have a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_02]: different really cool northern lights cuts
now that I'd like to add to that reading
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know like I said there was that
pre flower problem or the males that I
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to keep alive from that I've had
that problem with other lines I had that
[SPEAKER_02]: problem with the British Columbia seed
club released the Bodhi release a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of those males would pre flower so um
maybe it was meant to be that those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't pop I might be able to get back and
and rework that line unfortunately classic
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds does not want that line released
pure so it's kind of a shame but if it
[SPEAKER_02]: goes you know it goes with kegu and
classic so they're the real holders to
[SPEAKER_02]: that line without them I wouldn't have had
access to it and I really appreciate the
[SPEAKER_02]: access to it and everything kegu taught me
about open pollinations and preservation
[SPEAKER_02]: and gene pools and bam is really really
smart you know he taught me a lot about
[SPEAKER_02]: bottlenecking and the genetic aspects of
it so it was a shame that you know coastal
[SPEAKER_02]: had to go our separate ways but uh I'm
still focusing on doing the same thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: was doing there and getting these uh
classic indicas in the seed form and
[SPEAKER_02]: recreate what I remember in the 90s uh as
good nl crosses good nl hash land crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that has been lost yeah
admirable goal admirable goal I mean just
[SPEAKER_00]: to quickly clarify out of those prior nl1
crosses you did which one was your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal favorite I see there's still a
huge amount of demand for puck yeah puck
[SPEAKER_02]: yes fuck man that one's killer I have 10
to 15 maybe 20 packs of those I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting on and I'm like I said I have so
much work I've done over the years and so
[SPEAKER_02]: many directions I could go man I just I
need different spots you know because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't just contaminate pollen because it's
just all useless then so I can only do it
[SPEAKER_02]: one project at a time and it's a lot of
time and hard work to actually test stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: out you know um that's where uh all the
learning comes from you know I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: how these breeders do it they uh just sell
untested seeds man uh growing it out is
[SPEAKER_02]: the funnest part and learning from the
crosses is the most rewarding part so if
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone out there is uh wanting to know how
to become a good breeder you need to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to grow your crosses and you need
to grow as many different types of plants
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible you need to know what you like
and you need to know what you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for growing your crosses out in as large
quantities as uh you can it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: teach you what 's there and what you have
and it'll teach you about the gene pool
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah some wise words there on the topic of
a slightly different nl I noticed that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pterodactyl cross you released it's nl
2 by 5 is this something you made is it
[SPEAKER_00]: different stock and what sort of traits
does this male bring to the table that
[SPEAKER_02]: male was another open pollination that
line is amazing amazing line um I was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing an open pollination with f2 seed
stock when I made that cross and um the f2
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds were made by canorado the f1 seeds
were made by Jim Ortega so it's Jim
[SPEAKER_02]: Ortega's seed stock you know I love I'm
really happy with that line um I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: you know talk to Bodhi about it because I
don't talk to Jim Ortega myself and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to step on anybody's toes but I
would definitely um love to take that one
[SPEAKER_02]: f4 and share that one with the public when
I um made the f3s I put in the nl2 clone
[SPEAKER_02]: and um that was Jim Ortega's stock and we
just gave those away as freebies because
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't seem right you know he's the the
caretaker of that line for so long and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I just get a couple pieces and for me
to be the person that cash in that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: not the way I like to do things I like to
stay in my own lane with that being said I
[SPEAKER_02]: am gonna ask Bodhi if he can ask Jim if he
minds if I release that nf4 it needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: out there in the public it's one of the
best nl lines there is that's killer and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so exciting to hear I guess the
reason why I'm asking you about all these
[SPEAKER_00]: various northern lights varieties and the
crosses you've done is because I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of trying to get a feel for all the
different ones and what they bring which
[SPEAKER_00]: one to you is the best if you could only
pick one and what is maybe a unique trade
[SPEAKER_00]: about each one of them versus the others
if we just think about the three ones
[SPEAKER_00]: we've spoken about be it the nl5 the nl1
and the 2x5 great question the best line
[SPEAKER_02]: is either the nl1 or the 2x5 I would love
to get into those together those are the
[SPEAKER_02]: two nl lines in seed form that remind me
of the 90s nl's I'm spacing out the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: seed company they used to be lighthouse
seeds and then they split up they have
[SPEAKER_02]: some really nice nl they crossed their
five by two and those guys have a really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice nl seed line and sucks I'm spacing
out their new name but they split up and
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the nl lines on on the market
these days don't remind me of nl at all
[SPEAKER_02]: from the 90s and those ones that I just
mentioned to have little bits and pieces
[SPEAKER_02]: of the quality nl's in them but it's not
the whole picture and um that's why I said
[SPEAKER_02]: when something like that the brood x you
know almost reminds me of a really high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality northern lights from the 90s
better than these pure inbred lines just
[SPEAKER_02]: because uh everything in that I believe
goes back to northern lights and the
[SPEAKER_02]: phenos you know just are coming through
right they express themselves there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: few nl's I haven't got to check out I
haven't got to check out deep elms um I
[SPEAKER_02]: got to look through ak bean brains nl5 by
one um that wasn't exactly what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for but I have a really nice
keeper cut of ak bean brains nl1 and um
[SPEAKER_02]: she seems like what I remember and um she
seems really nice similar similar type
[SPEAKER_02]: plant structure to the puck so yeah killer
killer oh dude I'm down to take a bong
[SPEAKER_00]: head and get some water for sure hey oh
how you doing I just spilled my chop bowl
[SPEAKER_02]: god damn it I just uh took two bong heads
overkill now I'm gonna do a gan daddy oh
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah what's the overkill taste like acridy
earthy musty really nice afghani I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: um ever since I had it I've really missed
that train wreck bx with the tie I had
[SPEAKER_02]: while I was at your place it was so nice
yeah that was the a5 haze tie male that
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that uh karma bred that buddy
selected oh so good for sure the male uh
[SPEAKER_02]: produced fucking fire I bred him to this
purple congo land race cut and um this guy
[SPEAKER_02]: greased him around here and humble um and
it was fucking amazing that male just
[SPEAKER_02]: produced well with everything that's why I
said uh there's a shy or super silver haze
[SPEAKER_02]: super silver sour diesel crossed by a
super silver haze by that male should just
[SPEAKER_00]: have some phenomenal stuff on the gene
pool do you ever plan to work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck line or the train wreck bx any
further or is more of just like a one off
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it in seed so you know it's hard to
communicate with the seed market and the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff over instagram and stuff you know I
wish I could just sell my seeds directly
[SPEAKER_02]: and talk to the people when they bought
them you know and tell them about what's
[SPEAKER_02]: in there directly you know I think a lot
of the seed buyers want everything to be
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly worked and they have zero
hermaphrodites and be the perfect seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: you know just like you would get with
tomato seeds unfortunately cannabis hasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: been worked as much and I don't even know
um even with it being worked as hard if
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you can eliminate her
hermaphrodite traits from certain lines
[SPEAKER_02]: completely because you get them in so many
different environments and people feed
[SPEAKER_02]: differently and put plants too close
together put lights too close to plants
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of different things that are
trigger hermaphrodites uh that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: even happen normally you know like all the
chem clones will hermaphrodite if you do
[SPEAKER_02]: the wrong things to them but if you treat
them right they won't hermaphrodite um you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to have them too root bound you
don't want to have them too close to the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights you don't want to have them too
crammed together those are things that
[SPEAKER_02]: will cause the actual chem cuts the 91 and
the d to hermaphrodite so of course it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to cause their seeds to do the same
thing so you know I would really like to
[SPEAKER_02]: get that train wreck back cross out to the
public but am I going to be able to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: um stable enough I don't know um I've
talked to um Shaba the person who has uh
[SPEAKER_02]: the most experience back crossing
different clones and he said he had tried
[SPEAKER_02]: to do the train wreck a few times and that
always was just hermaphrodite mass you
[SPEAKER_02]: know so what I'm looking with now um
there's about 25 percent hermaphrodites
[SPEAKER_02]: and the train wreck back cross one I had
mentioned in my last podcast I'm not the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest fan of train wreck um you know
it's the type of terpenes that can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: get played out if you smoke it for a long
period of time that being said some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that I've found in the back crosses
was really phenomenal and um just really
[SPEAKER_02]: uh cool you know like some more garlic
expressions um some more leather
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions brought to the typical train
wreck uh to paneling uh pine saw cleaner
[SPEAKER_02]: uh lemon pledge type of smell you know
kind of stuck like I had mentioned earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: I have so many projects I don't know how
much time I can devote to that project and
[SPEAKER_02]: get it stable enough to where I feel
comfortable releasing it to the public and
[SPEAKER_02]: um you know I thought about releasing the
bx1 because I don't know if I'm ever going
[SPEAKER_02]: to bx to it or get the f2 with f3 f4
stabilize it you know and I could release
[SPEAKER_02]: it and there's amazing phenos to be found
in there and even more amazing breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: stock to be found and you know the
possibilities to take it to f3 and f4 and
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilize it and look through large
numbers and you know only breed with the
[SPEAKER_02]: stable ones the potential to bring amazing
lines is in there so you know it's it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: tough spot to be in but as of right now
it's it's it's it's shelved and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of sitting on the shelf and I don't
know what I'm going to do with it
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting interesting maybe it'll pop
its head back out when you get a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: delve into some of that more sativa work
but I wanted to loop back quickly to a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain you mentioned earlier I should have
asked you that should be the theme of this
[SPEAKER_00]: interview just missing my opportunities
but the London pound cake is an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting strain for a few reasons
because it's being used by cookie fam but
[SPEAKER_00]: it hasn't made quite the same impact as
many of the other cookie cuts have what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your impressions of it and do you think it
breeds well I think they've just done a
[SPEAKER_02]: better job not letting that one get out
unfortunately I think Jigger doesn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: his stuff getting out and you know his
stuff constantly gets out and it's I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine being him how painful that's gotta
be especially when you don't want it out
[SPEAKER_02]: there because it's amazing shit that being
said this one came from growing with
[SPEAKER_02]: passion he got it from Jigger him and Dela
did breeding with that serious male from
[SPEAKER_02]: South Fork seeds it's Shahbaz 707 Chem Dog
bred to Stardog I took a male off of that
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred that to Chem D and I passed them
some seeds and they bred that to wedding
[SPEAKER_02]: cake and burner named the strain Medeen
and I got that London pound cake back as a
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you I am not exactly sure what
number it is it was one of the keepers
[SPEAKER_02]: really like it it produces a mega weight I
passed it to a friend mine up here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt that are production growers and
they're getting up to three pounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: light with it the shit will go purple if
you give it any kind of cold it's super
[SPEAKER_02]: chirpy it's it's really good I definitely
wouldn't have run with it if I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: think it was really good and it could
bring some really cool stuff to the table
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a Sunset Sherbert cross I'm
not exactly sure what it was crossed to I
[SPEAKER_02]: really like the Sunset Sherbert besides
the original cookies cut the Sunset
[SPEAKER_02]: Sherbert is my favorite thing that that
crew has done and then behind the Sunset
[SPEAKER_02]: Sherbert and my personal picks would be
probably London pound cake and biscotti
[SPEAKER_02]: and not really a fan of the gelato but I
think the London pound cake is pretty cool
[SPEAKER_02]: and as far as a cut for production for
work right now it's it's a really killer
[SPEAKER_00]: cut to have what a great answer it makes
me want to quickly ask you are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: other cuts that are really hot in the
scene at the moment you know sort of ones
[SPEAKER_00]: in that hype category that you're kind of
fond of like for example you know maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe like you know you really like Mac or
whatever I love Mac people say weird stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: about it I think it's great is there any
current hype cuts that you're particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: fond of no I really recognize and respect
everyone's marketing abilities with that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of thing but most of the stuff that's
really getting a lot of play right now I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like all the cookie stuff down from
the cookies Sunset Sherbert gelato
[SPEAKER_02]: biscotti crosses it all has a certain type
of high I really don't like it I love the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed when you're just judging quality weed
tastes great smokes great gets you high as
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck especially if you don't have anything
else or you haven't had anything else it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice weed but when you have the
options of some of the classic highs that
[SPEAKER_02]: I have and my personal the high from that
stuff is just a little bit flat in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion yeah no fair point fair point I
always find it interesting to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of highs that people like
another sort of comparison I was hoping to
[SPEAKER_00]: get from you is I think you've probably
got more experience with different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of Afghanis than anyone and a few of our
listeners were interested in hearing if
[SPEAKER_00]: you could tell us sort of what the
different type of Afghanis you've come
[SPEAKER_00]: across are in terms of like your broad
leaf and your thin leaf and the effects
[SPEAKER_00]: like do you just think that most Afghanis
are either like a body high or a head high
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you think there's a lot more
diversity within it and and I guess kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of maybe another way to summarize it is
what do you think when someone says oh you
[SPEAKER_00]: know an indica is an indica do you feel
like now that's not really true or where
[SPEAKER_02]: do you sit on that with the Afghanis man I
definitely don't think an indica is an
[SPEAKER_02]: indica there's definitely different
effects of indica's I like the stuff from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Hindu Kush mountain ranges from the
highland those are my favorites I've
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed two major types the the sweeter
berry Afghanis grapes berries and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: more acrid earthy musty basement types you
know some families are combination of the
[SPEAKER_02]: two they have both in the gene pool or
some plants carry both qualities but as
[SPEAKER_02]: you get closer to Pakistan you're going to
get more turps in the weed Pakistani weed
[SPEAKER_02]: is a little more turpy a little more
branchy as you get more southern in
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan you get out of the Hindu Kush
mountain range are plants that have longer
[SPEAKER_02]: inner node spacings more sativa influence
in the gene pool I wish I had more
[SPEAKER_02]: landrace Afghanis to learn from you know
those aren't my best teaching tools that
[SPEAKER_02]: and the landrace Paki lines all the
landrace Paki lines I've encountered have
[SPEAKER_02]: been through Bodhi I've increased the
vintage Pakistani from Bodhi twice I have
[SPEAKER_02]: this Peshawar Paki I bought seven packs of
that probably more packs than anyone else
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm need to get into those here really
soon you know there there's no better
[SPEAKER_02]: teachers than the plants and I just try to
grow as many different landrace lines as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible I wish I could release them all
unfortunately people are kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: protective over them and I understand it's
kind of like I had mentioned about Jim
[SPEAKER_02]: Ortega stock he has all that awesome now
that he's never really profited off of and
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't really seem fair for me to sell
the the nl2 by nl2 by 5 from him so I just
[SPEAKER_02]: gave it away for free because I just
acquired it it's kind of like that with
[SPEAKER_02]: landrace as I do several increases with
them I feel like I'm more entitled to
[SPEAKER_02]: share them with the public but when I just
get something right away and just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: cash it out it just it just doesn't seem
right I have a lot of respect for this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant you know I've turned down lots of
money for clones 10g is before I've never
[SPEAKER_02]: sold clones ever so I just we're just
guardians of this plant and I just try to
[SPEAKER_02]: do do right by her and she does right by
me and it's such a teaching plant that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know one of the lessons that's taught me
is not to be greedy and show respect
[SPEAKER_00]: everything has its time so nice nice a
good sort of mantra to strive to speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: about time what's your thoughts on some of
the indicators we saw in the 90s that
[SPEAKER_00]: would largely be described as sort of like
creeper indicators you know where they had
[SPEAKER_00]: like a really slow onset and then they
would just hit you super hard it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like that sort of strain isn't really
around anymore do you think that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: lost them over time or that it was just
more of a reflection of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of good quality bud and
people just being reminiscent of about
[SPEAKER_00]: those sorts of high quality weed when it
didn't come around very often well to
[SPEAKER_02]: notice that effect you got to be sober
when you smoke that creeper weed and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to smoke no other weed for a while
until that creeper effect creeps up on you
[SPEAKER_02]: to be honest I do have some crosses that
do have that aspect some of them 10 is
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like a creeper Afghani that purple
Hindu Kush will creep up on you the purple
[SPEAKER_02]: Hindu Kush crosses will creep up on you
but like I said you got to be sober when
[SPEAKER_02]: you smoke them and then you got to smoke
them and just not smoke anything for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while to kind of like have noticed that
effect if you're just like at an emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: cup situation where you're there smoking
tons of different weed in your high as
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck already you're not even going to
notice something like that you know yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very valid point isn't it you got
to it's about the set and setting as well
[SPEAKER_02]: hmm yeah definitely very important you
notice that creeper effect a lot of times
[SPEAKER_02]: when you smoke some weed and then you go
into a store there you go there you go
[SPEAKER_00]: another question we got was are you able
to describe the differences between your
[SPEAKER_00]: two different black dominant cuts the 95
versus the healing harvest one okay so the
[SPEAKER_02]: 95 is more that accurate earthy musty
basement almost bubba kush funky sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: type of thing and then the healing harvest
has more of more turps just it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to describe the smell it's almost
like a tupperware plastic smell with like
[SPEAKER_02]: garlic behind it so I had read on mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: nice forums where Neville said at some
point he switched out the recipe for the
[SPEAKER_02]: black domino he switched out the afghani
one the m10 and he switched in garlic but
[SPEAKER_02]: in its place so I wonder if the healing
harvest is after he switched out the
[SPEAKER_02]: garlic bud because it kind of has that
garlic thing going on the garlic bud would
[SPEAKER_02]: have brought a little bit more sativa to
the gene pool the original black domino
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty much 100 percent indica being
hash plant or tega northern lights and
[SPEAKER_02]: afghani number one m10 he uh mentioned
that he didn't like the afghani number one
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that's just because it came
from sam you know because when you look
[SPEAKER_02]: back in history if you look back at the
afghani one m10 it's probably behind more
[SPEAKER_02]: strains than any other uh land race
afghani you know jj used it in his work
[SPEAKER_02]: it's in the choir electric it's in snow
lotus blockhead I can't think of them all
[SPEAKER_02]: right now but it the amount of strains
that go back to afghani number one is
[SPEAKER_00]: truly impressive yeah I mean I've only
ever really tried one sample that was
[SPEAKER_00]: given to me as afghani number one and it
was some really really nice stuff I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking of cuts where there's different
ones of it out there and talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences there was some interest around
the different headbands and cuts can you
[SPEAKER_00]: give us a rundown on your headband and is
it the same one that other people use or
[SPEAKER_02]: is your one unique so I can't say what
what the other people use but um I do know
[SPEAKER_02]: that my cut has been passed around a lot I
passed it to duke diamond um not so dog
[SPEAKER_02]: has it you know it's really um good cut
it's renamed og had to get renamed the
[SPEAKER_02]: person that renamed it reminded them of uh
weasel's headband so that's the reason he
[SPEAKER_02]: used the name um had that same headband
what kind of effect on your head so
[SPEAKER_02]: there's that headband um not so dog calls
it the 56 day headband he also has uh
[SPEAKER_02]: lumpus headband and that's pretty similar
but um different I like mine much better
[SPEAKER_02]: there's also the la kush headband that not
so dark holds that one's more like sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel mandel brought brought that one up
from la that one's fucking amazing and
[SPEAKER_02]: then there's a 707 headband that dna
released and there's some really good
[SPEAKER_02]: keeper finos in that too that I've seen so
weasels original headband which I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think is alive anymore so there's a ton of
different headbands and it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: confusing topic and that's about all I
know about that one no that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: rundown I think that's what we were sort
of hoping to touch on and likewise in a
[SPEAKER_00]: recent episode we spoke with mean gene
about big sir holy weed and what was
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting was he kind of mentioned that
he got some seeds which might be one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the parent lines that made the big sir
holy weed it's sort of a longer story I
[SPEAKER_00]: won't go into it all but it relates to
this strain called Dolores did you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: get the backstory from kegyu on the big
sir holy weed or just from anyone even
[SPEAKER_00]: like what have you heard about its origins
and the stuff you work with under coastal
[SPEAKER_00]: was that from kegyu's collection or how
were those seeds acquired so uh kegyu got
[SPEAKER_02]: his big sir holy weed from a surfer guy
that's what he told me and um kegyu's an
[SPEAKER_02]: old timer you know he's getting close to
80 at this point and uh he's the oldest
[SPEAKER_02]: dude I know that smokes weed still and
grows and he's like the og of ogs I've
[SPEAKER_02]: never you know met anyone even close so
he's been around santa cruz his whole life
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and seen the evolution of
cannabis since you know when the
[SPEAKER_02]: brotherhood was bringing in stuff so his
perspectives are just like so valuable to
[SPEAKER_02]: him the mexican blocks that built the big
sir holy from what I know it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: afghani-mexican cross zacatecas purple
zacatecas I think Dolores is a town near
[SPEAKER_02]: there um they're two towns two right in
the same region that's uh all I know about
[SPEAKER_02]: that I do know his big sir holy line is
super high quality I don't have any of
[SPEAKER_02]: that seed stock you know it's super high
quality stuff I wish I did at one point I
[SPEAKER_02]: had a keeper cut to grow it out and um
Colorado some samples got the adam done
[SPEAKER_02]: and it reminded him of the same big sir
whole holy that was in sage it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: good weed really interesting gene pull and
he just told me he got it from some surfer
[SPEAKER_02]: and he had had it for quite some time and
then done a few and see seed increases on
[SPEAKER_02]: it that's all I know about that he'd have
to elaborate further yeah nice a good
[SPEAKER_00]: little background on that one I think it's
one where we'll always sort of be trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out the exact truth around it
you were talking about the LA pure kush
[SPEAKER_00]: headband and a few other strands just
shortly ago which of the pure kush cuts is
[SPEAKER_02]: the best for hash in your opinion I'm not
really a hash maker so I like to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: from the plant and um honestly I think I
in the last few years I've been wanting uh
[SPEAKER_02]: to make hash more than ever just to learn
about the different types of calyxes and
[SPEAKER_02]: the way they make hash and the different
strains I have so I can relate their
[SPEAKER_02]: qualities to hash makers because I'm not
really a hash maker so I I really don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have any uh knowledge or any uh field I've
never made hash really I've made keith a
[SPEAKER_00]: few times but that was in the 90s yeah no
fair enough answer fair enough answer one
[SPEAKER_00]: of our listeners did want to ask what you
know about the history of your master kush
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting and what's it like as a cultivar I
think this is an interesting question
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of people enjoy master kush
but it's seldomly tests very high so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those older ones that is truly old
school in that it's good weed but the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers don't reflect it what do you know
about the backstory on it so I've had it
[SPEAKER_02]: since probably around 2010 maybe a few
years longer than that I got it from a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend that really knows good weed and he
knows a lot of people he's a glass seller
[SPEAKER_02]: he sells you know glass artwork and
travels around a lot he brought it up from
[SPEAKER_02]: New Mexico I had heard it came from
Florida to New Mexico she's really really
[SPEAKER_02]: special she has one of the most relaxing
calming buzzes perfect for like watching a
[SPEAKER_02]: movie and just sitting there relaxing
you're gonna just soak right into the plot
[SPEAKER_02]: and think about nothing else I'm
definitely gonna get to a project a master
[SPEAKER_02]: kush project I'm gonna search through a
few different crosses I made with that
[SPEAKER_02]: master kush across the gabul kush and a
few others and mean gene actually gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: some deep chunk master kush seeds and look
through those and find the best line that
[SPEAKER_02]: I think amplifies the math master kush
qualities and and bring that one to seed
[SPEAKER_02]: form is a goal and I also have the SoCal
master I want to work into that project
[SPEAKER_02]: and just got old master kush from Eugene
Oregon and really excited to work that
[SPEAKER_00]: project Wow no no shortage of projects on
the horizon is there I love it you're
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping yourself busy when you're doing
one of these projects do you pop a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: number of seeds or is it like I just pop
all the seeds of that line I have what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your number of seeds you like to pop to
search through things 40 or 50 minimum I
[SPEAKER_02]: like to ideally do more but I hear people
on Instagram a lot say you know I got a
[SPEAKER_02]: pack so I can get a mail you know 12 seeds
is not you need at least twice three times
[SPEAKER_02]: four times that many you know really look
through the population and you need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with the gene pool and what
you're looking for really helps somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: had just mentioned to me on Instagram that
they got the oracle cut it's down from me
[SPEAKER_02]: and they wanted to buy a pack of light of
Venus to make a back cross and I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: well don't buy one pack by four grow that
oracle clone out three or four times so
[SPEAKER_02]: you get familiar with it know what you're
dealing with what you're looking for and
[SPEAKER_02]: then pop those four packs then you'll know
what you're looking for in a male to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: to the table for your back cross you know
the bigger your selections the better your
[SPEAKER_02]: end results and I look at it this way if
you're not finding keepers and the females
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not going to be keepers in the
males and it's as simple as that so I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it begs the question have you got any new
tips for us about how to select a male do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think it differs from strain to strain
or are there any golden characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you see that thing on any strain
you're like yep I want it I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: differs from strain to strain and what
type of qualities you want that male to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring to the table okay I was gonna say on
the topic of popping seeds which we just
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke about are there any new lines you're
thinking about going through or any new
[SPEAKER_00]: seed stock you've been given that you're
excited to pop next wow um you know right
[SPEAKER_02]: now I'm going through overkill black muddy
river um and both the black dominance
[SPEAKER_02]: cross to the m10 you know testing the m10
black dominance for release and then also
[SPEAKER_02]: running all those different crosses
head-to-head to see which is the best one
[SPEAKER_02]: to further a black dominant project so
those seeds are going now but I'm really
[SPEAKER_02]: excited about that I'm also growing og
kush lazy dog um headband lazy dog
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethiopian banana m10 malawi m10 Panama red
m10 and um more brood x popped a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: more brood x because that shit's just
ridiculous I'm like couldn't be happier
[SPEAKER_02]: with that and I popped a bunch of lazy
dogs I want to look through more of those
[SPEAKER_02]: um before I take the line f2 and f3 I
don't want to miss anything wow there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some some nice projects in the mix there I
noticed that I feel like there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct lack of banana crosses in the
market and you just mentioned one do you
[SPEAKER_00]: plan to do any further work with the
banana lines and I'm guessing you just use
[SPEAKER_02]: the banana og as the base no that's the
Ethiopian highland banana cut Bodhi
[SPEAKER_02]: selected and she is amazing two to one CBD
what's the highlight do you still feel the
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive side or the CBD is just too
high no you definitely uh get high um I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not as familiar with that one is the
Panama red but you know the Panama red cut
[SPEAKER_02]: I used is the two to one the grandmother
to the coastal seeds uh CBD release that I
[SPEAKER_02]: did so that that cut is two to one CBD and
she definitely gets you high and she'll
[SPEAKER_02]: get you fucked up and she can produce
everything cannabinoid wise uh THCV CBG's
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD THC it's going to be cool to get that
one out there because I've seen some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the testers grow that already and it
looked phenomenal I had to grow that one
[SPEAKER_02]: myself before I released it to see how
good it was that's awesome and when like
[SPEAKER_00]: what sort of plants would you expect when
you're crossing it with such a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: indica man they really look like m10 I'm
shocked and I had grown the Malawi um and
[SPEAKER_02]: Malawi gold m10s out already and Ed
shortened the flowering time down
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically you know almost 50% so I'm
assuming it's going to do the same thing
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with how indica looking the
first few sets of leaves are with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Panama red and um testers that finished it
said it it didn't go 10 weeks so really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about that one hell yeah and do
you do you see the banana flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: translating through it all or is it
dominated by the uh the indica as well
[SPEAKER_02]: well I haven't um grown those ones out
there's a few testers that got those in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower now but the Ethiopian bananas um
have not by m10 haven't been finished yet
[SPEAKER_00]: okay yeah because I think I remember Bodhi
saying that it was like a different sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of banana flavor to the banana roji is
that correct yeah yeah it is but it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: banana it's unmistakable and um just
really loud especially for a land race cut
[SPEAKER_00]: she's special yeah wow that'll be that'll
be interesting to see how it turns out you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned the overkill as one of the lines
you're thinking about popping more seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: of and it made me remember back to our
first chat where you referenced a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: from your youth you were looking to
recreate called the kill and um I was
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering if you had made any further
progress in attempting to recreate it and
[SPEAKER_00]: is that something you're still sort of
working towards long term or have you sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of decided on pursuing other projects when
I uh think of high grade cannabis that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get in the seed form with these
nl lines that's definitely like what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: aiming for and um that quality um
obviously I don't have any of that seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock or um I have similar related plants
but uh I'm trying to work with what I have
[SPEAKER_02]: to recreate that quality as best as I can
and very happy with the direction I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: headed and what we have achieved so far
with that where is it up to I remember is
[SPEAKER_00]: it the case that you've you've put it
together and you're working through it now
[SPEAKER_00]: or are you looking to sort of recombine
some extra things into the picture so I
[SPEAKER_02]: have recreated the cross it was very good
and very close but not as good I did
[SPEAKER_02]: airborne g13 which is nl2 by g13 to my nl
hash plant mouse that creates the the
[SPEAKER_02]: pedigree for the kill it was nl hash plant
nl g13 those are really phenomenal really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice plants but as far as me achieving
that goal I'm not done I think I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep working these lines a little bit
further and just follow what the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: tell me but I think if I uh I have an
airborne cross again those two uh gene
[SPEAKER_02]: pulls and crosses with something like the
brood x I might be pretty darn close yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: wow okay that's that's exciting because
that's what just like one cross away
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly and then a finer hunt yeah
everything we've been dropping along these
[SPEAKER_02]: lines I'm really really happy with and
really proud of to be getting it out there
[SPEAKER_02]: into the gene pool so uh if I can recreate
something as good as something I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: in my youth is that even possible you know
I'm not quite sure because I think the way
[SPEAKER_02]: we remember things uh everything uh from a
certain point in time is kind of special a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people remember uh you know or
never get over talking about their high
[SPEAKER_02]: school years I have certain friends that
every single time I want to talk to them
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to talk about my high school
years and stuff you know the golden age
[SPEAKER_02]: was that weed that good or was it I just
wasn't used to weed that good and that was
[SPEAKER_02]: a special time in my life it's something
I'm never going to be quite sure on yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interesting I think that tolerance
definitely plays some part in it all
[SPEAKER_00]: having taken a few tolerance breaks over
the past year or so when I come back it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a different sort of high like you you can
get to this point where you just you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: like you you're almost like useless like
you just debilitated it's interesting but
[SPEAKER_00]: the tolerance comes back reasonably
quickly I've found but I think you can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably make something better but I don't
know I feel like when I'm smoking good
[SPEAKER_00]: weed after a tolerance break it's hard to
tell it's super good because it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like any weed would get me super high yeah
and back then in the 90s we were smoking a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of swag and you know some time that
the kill would come around and when we
[SPEAKER_02]: were smoking Mexican brick weed that was a
year old you know yeah I mean god it would
[SPEAKER_02]: make a difference then yeah I mean like if
I could take some of this uh killer phenol
[SPEAKER_02]: at Brutex I found and I took back that you
know to the 90s you know I think it would
[SPEAKER_02]: be just as good it just might be you know
how I remember stuff from my youth and not
[SPEAKER_00]: having that high quality of weed back then
yeah okay interesting well I mean it
[SPEAKER_00]: raises the idea you know you've got that
female of the Brutex would you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: consider doing feminized seeds and like
just using that female of the Brutex
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already found that is what you want
and just crossing stuff to the female and
[SPEAKER_00]: as a general question would Quicketson
Cicada ever do feminized seeds so um that
[SPEAKER_02]: female is really good and if I you know
have stuff like that I might do it you
[SPEAKER_02]: know especially if people want feminized
seeds from a line of mine I just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have much desire to go around feminizing
you know elite clones you know maybe if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's something we've isolated after you
know several generations of our own work
[SPEAKER_00]: that would make more sense to me but yeah
interesting I think that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are so interested in all of the
elite clones you've got in your library
[SPEAKER_00]: that they sort of are begging the question
you know would you ever do s1s of the red
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese hash plan of these really rare
cuts the purple Hindu Kush or is that less
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to you than doing out crosses
with them it's definitely less interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: the most interesting is to try to get
those clones in the seed form using as
[SPEAKER_02]: pure Afghani crosses that are similar as
possible and to bring them to the market
[SPEAKER_02]: in seed form that's the most exciting to
me I definitely see value in s1ing them
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting that out to the public I just
it's not what I'm going to devote my time
[SPEAKER_00]: to right now yeah understandable well
there you go at least I mean at least it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a possibility on the horizon if you ever
wanted to pursue it further I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly ask you about one of your new
strains kind bud cool name it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising it hasn't been taken thus far
but it's generated a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly I think because of the Maui
dog is one of the parents but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: photos been looking killer what is the
flavors and traits people can expect from
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind bud and the sort of effect man
that stuff is really really good and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: got a really really awesome high it's got
that's the reason we went with kind bud
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got a really just makes you feel
happy it's got that old-school 90s weed by
[SPEAKER_02]: the Maui dog is chem 91 backseat most
likely in s1 really nice chem phenols in
[SPEAKER_02]: there it's a it's a good one man you know
it's something that I'd be happy smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: on all day long every day that's one of
Hannah bolts favorites lately she's been
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking that a lot we didn't see any
plants that weren't really really good
[SPEAKER_02]: they were all really really good they're a
little bit picky in early veg not the
[SPEAKER_02]: strongest plants that probably comes back
to it going back to come 91 possibly three
[SPEAKER_02]: times in two generations it really uh as
they get bigger they get stronger and
[SPEAKER_02]: really uh turns into high quality weed if
you flower them out right there's about 65
[SPEAKER_02]: days maybe a little longer a little
shorter depending upon the female or some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff do you favor the shorter flowering
finos the longer ones or do you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of independently a variable of the
keeper female it could be a longer it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a short there's another trait you
sort of look for is the one you decided is
[SPEAKER_02]: the keeper man there's some really killer
stuff in there I haven't really looked
[SPEAKER_02]: through as large of a population as I
would like and at some point I will be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking through more of those because
they're of such high quality I think the
[SPEAKER_02]: best finos in the net are just really a
lot like chem weed you know like the 91
[SPEAKER_02]: chem not the chem d they're turning out
like the 91 and um if you get a pack of
[SPEAKER_02]: that definitely keep cuts that's what I
would say about that one nice so something
[SPEAKER_00]: a few people had asked me to get in this
episode was do you have any plans to do
[SPEAKER_00]: any collaborations in the future no plans
an immediate future too much on the cards
[SPEAKER_02]: already I'm pretty busy and I like to stay
in my own lane yeah okay so we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see the crickets and cicada
cookies collab oh I don't think me and jig
[SPEAKER_02]: are gonna have a club anytime soon Duke
and I have talked about it in the past I
[SPEAKER_02]: jokingly said let's hit the four away with
your skunk mail and hit the Virginia Beach
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghans with the m10 oh yeah and he said
we'd start way too many seed banks with
[SPEAKER_02]: that one I've always heard the rumor that
the Virginia Beach Afghani is m10 after
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone I think it is I've had similar
Afghani one that reminded me of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia Beach one yeah they remind me of
each other too so interesting stuff okay
[SPEAKER_00]: and then last question I wanted to ask you
before we get into the final five is are
[SPEAKER_00]: there any old world cuts or land races
that you've got your eye on you haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: been able to get yet but you'd love to get
into your collection just more Afghani and
[SPEAKER_02]: Paki lines you know I prefer old stock
that's been sitting in somebody's dome
[SPEAKER_02]: canister seed drawer that seems to be the
best ones they're hard to come up with I
[SPEAKER_02]: have a couple hundred seeds I got from a
friend here in Hubbell County that he got
[SPEAKER_02]: from my friend that's best Afghani lines
that this guy had ever seen and honestly
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scared to get into them because if
they don't crack it's done if anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: knows anything about tissue culture and
seeds hit me up Wow yes please anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's got some info on tissue culture
please reach out that would be incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: all right on to the final quickfire
questions here's hopefully some new ones
[SPEAKER_00]: since we last spoke what's been the I
wouldn't say the best but what's been some
[SPEAKER_00]: weed you've had in the last couple years
that really blew you away with how good it
[SPEAKER_00]: was maybe you weren't expecting it to be
particularly good but just really hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: spot for you the sensei star cut that I
used for the brood X I got it from JJ he
[SPEAKER_02]: said I'd like it and he was right and
she's super high quality and she passed
[SPEAKER_02]: those qualities on to the brood X I'm
extremely happy with that actually grew a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of the sensei star out with the
brood X and I barely even touched the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensei star the brood X is so good some
nice stuff I think I was lucky enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: try some of that when I was with you and
really nice stuff indeed so on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the spectrum what's some weed that
was really hyped up to you by some friends
[SPEAKER_00]: or someone and eventually you try it and
you were just like a bit disappointed
[SPEAKER_02]: gelato was pretty hyped up but that was a
few years ago but I you know that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: never lived up to the hype to me that's
about it that I can think of good stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the weed you must try I guess
that's not a bad list there so all right
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm gonna drop you off on a deserted
island and you can grow three strains for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of your life which three are you
gonna take with you are we talking clones
[SPEAKER_02]: or we can I take three of my seed lines
yeah you could take three of your seed
[SPEAKER_02]: lines if you prefer or you can take client
I would take lazy dog brood X and overkill
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow you just think you'd be able to mix
and match enough with those to get
[SPEAKER_02]: everything you wanted yeah I'll be able to
bring everything I wanted out of the gene
[SPEAKER_02]: pools the cam the northern lions that hash
plant they're all extremely potent the
[SPEAKER_02]: lazy dogs I'm growing a bunch more of them
out I'm planning on taking that line at f3
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's just really good smoke and the
brood X came out exceptional just I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: really stoked with the way it's smoking
out and that's super potent and the
[SPEAKER_02]: hardest part is finding one you know is
not a keeper yeah always a good challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: that one when deciding what what yeah
can't keep because there's too many good
[SPEAKER_00]: ones so on the other end of the spectrum
you're gonna drop someone off to this
[SPEAKER_00]: desert island who you're not particularly
fond of and you're gonna leave them with
[SPEAKER_00]: three strains what three you're gonna
leave them with oh man that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: ruthless we're gonna give them the gelato
33 and the 41 and what else are we gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: give them runs the same thing love it have
fun with that gene pool hey it made me
[SPEAKER_00]: think did you see that post from Shabinsky
the other day where he's like these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the original gelato seeds no I didn't see
that one he posted a photo where they must
[SPEAKER_00]: have been like at least two three hundred
seeds in there I reckon and I was thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no way those are the original
seeds you would have popped them already
[SPEAKER_02]: man yeah I don't know anything about that
crew I just have a lot of respect for how
[SPEAKER_02]: they marketed those strands and the way
they changed the game with them that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I gotta say about that one there you
go all right well on to our last question
[SPEAKER_00]: what's one aspect or thing about the
industry or the community however you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to phrase it that you would change if
possible that you think would make a big
[SPEAKER_02]: difference I would change legalization I
would change it to more legalization not
[SPEAKER_02]: just corporate ramped up cannabis I think
it should be free for everyone to grow in
[SPEAKER_02]: every state as many plants as they want to
give it away to anyone to sell to anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what legal things should be you
know there's all this talk on Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: lately of all these big brands that want
to get rid of home grows and these states
[SPEAKER_02]: that are becoming legal man that's exactly
the thing that I would get rid of in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry hard to call the cannabis
community at this point nice what an
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome sentiment so I think that just
about brings us to the end of the episode
