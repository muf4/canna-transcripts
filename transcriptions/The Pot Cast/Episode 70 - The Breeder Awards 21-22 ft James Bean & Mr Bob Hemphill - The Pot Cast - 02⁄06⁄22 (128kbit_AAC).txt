[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty everyone we are back for another
Breeder Awards we're quite late and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really blame it on COVID to be
honest I think we've just been doing our
[SPEAKER_00]: respective things but nevertheless as
usual I'm joined by the man with his feet
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ground in the scene I'm still in
that one from Adam Dunn thank you very
[SPEAKER_02]: much James Bean for joining us thank you
appreciate having me again I feel humbled
[SPEAKER_02]: always you asked me to be on these news
this time I was like May didn't we do this
[SPEAKER_02]: one already but you know I get stoned so I
appreciate you know I love the show of
[SPEAKER_00]: course that's very sweet of you we love
having you on so as usual we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: our usual awards for the year including
strain of the year breeder of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: hottest new breeder on the block got some
Hall of Fame some shout outs and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: some final thoughts at the end hopefully
that sounds pretty good to everyone so the
[SPEAKER_00]: first award we'll do this year we might do
strain of the year or clone of the year we
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of combine them together you know
it's if you want to call it a strain of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year and it comes from seeds no
problem but we'll also count clones in
[SPEAKER_00]: this category so gosh I'm trying to remind
myself now what won it last year the year
[SPEAKER_00]: before that it was Mac we definitely did
like runs we were ahead of the curb on
[SPEAKER_00]: runs and then runs one and then oh yeah
yeah last year ice cream cake and what a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking good pick that was man yeah now
that you can you see that show out there
[SPEAKER_00]: to be sure all right cool so I mean let's
think I got to be honest I saw a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oreos this past year this past what was a
15 months or so and I was considering that
[SPEAKER_00]: for a bit but I also saw a large sort of
group of disparaging comments saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know all look no substance haven't had
it myself so I can't comment on that but
[SPEAKER_00]: that was definitely one I had in the mix
was there anything you sort of had in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mix before we reveal the winner oh well I
know what your winner is yeah you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't leaked the list but uh well I just
I know what I know what I think is gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: flood the the West Coast market what's
that jealousy I'm not sure if that's your
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that's a pretty good pick I'm gonna
say I saw I must have seen if I saw if I
[SPEAKER_02]: saw one I saw a thousand and one cuts
flying out of the animal capture like no
[SPEAKER_02]: question that will be grown and that's the
situation with the clone is that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: the same thing that everybody else has
unfortunately with a seed you're
[SPEAKER_02]: guaranteed something unique of course I'm
pushing seeds but you know that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: in every greenhouse by the thousand and I
guarantee in six months we're gonna look
[SPEAKER_02]: back and we're gonna say man I can get
jealousy for ten bucks a gram you know
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap as hell out there so I would say
that one or I don't know if they're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to resist one but the Gary Payton that's a
pretty good guess as well I definitely had
[SPEAKER_00]: those two in my top selections didn't
actually get the winner though so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: cool because we sort of we sort of
collectively covered them all I guess for
[SPEAKER_00]: this last one this last year I should say
that the thing that I considered was both
[SPEAKER_00]: what I saw in flower but also what I saw a
lot of breeders incorporating into their
[SPEAKER_00]: repertoire so really popular among some of
the more heady breeders in my book so the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 to 2022 strain of the year clone of
the year goes to none other than lumpy's
[SPEAKER_02]: apple fritter yeah I must be stoned
definitely with jealousy it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere apple fritter is a more tightly
held cut that you know certain group of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders definitely got their hands on
great strain has been used definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's kind of used it I've seen a
lot of different crosses with it no it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's it like Skittles ugly plant
but breeds true you know apple fritter is
[SPEAKER_02]: a great plant so definitely seen used a
bunch and yeah great pick for sure yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of those ones that's sort of been
gaining momentum for a few years now but
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely seen a lot of really
killer crosses coming out with it in it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I also think it's good you know like
shout out to lump status a guy who's
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed a lot of really cool clones to
the scene a part of that original crew
[SPEAKER_00]: with like you know abf frostboss norcalic
mag those guys from the bay area just
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in work over the past 15 years or
so so yeah congrats apple fritter it's
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere notably I've seen some sick
hybrids skunk va post some they look cool
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been iron off blooms done an
apple fritter hybrid that's cool as well
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah a lot of cool ones in the woodworks
and so the next category we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look see at will actually be let's
do the Hall of Fame let's get that one out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the way it's the Hall of Fame for us is
actually always a strain not a person so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're thinking about what strains have
contributed significantly over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: recent or years gone by that have really
sort of guided the way paved the landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: for future strains to roll on through so
we're always sort of looking back in this
[SPEAKER_00]: category and I think there's a lot of
really good contenders so after
[SPEAKER_00]: considering all the things I just
mentioned I'm thinking that this year
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to actually go with blueberry
from DJ short it's really a body of work
[SPEAKER_00]: that's hard to ignore both in terms of its
own merit standing individually as a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain the the f1 hybrids that come off it
in DJ's arsenal or that have lineage in
[SPEAKER_00]: commonality with it such as you know
things like the f13 and the true berry all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these strains tried and tested but I
think one of the other testaments to the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry family is that there is a huge
arguably bigger body of work that exists
[SPEAKER_00]: from what others have done with it outside
of what DJ has done so you know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: list of clones is literally endless I
could name a few you know even obvious one
[SPEAKER_00]: you know blue dream haha but like even if
we get even more into it like I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like blue diamond I've had a whole
range of really cool blueberry crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: from AK bean brains because he's done some
cool work with it likewise my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strain in seed form the blue Magoo comes
from the blueberry it's it's really you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't overstate how much of an impact this
work has had and I think there's a famous
[SPEAKER_00]: quote that's been said that something like
40% of all the plants tested at phylos or
[SPEAKER_00]: something had commonalities with blueberry
and I think there has been some healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: and robust discussion around that but if
nothing else it really does point to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that this strain has had such an
immense influence on the the genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: have come thereafter and it's it's so
tried and tested it's really one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: only strains you can say that is on that
level that a we still have active seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stock for and b is not a clone only we we
you know DJ's still around he's doing his
[SPEAKER_02]: thing yeah no I think I you know his son
uses the f4 mail quite a bit and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: the strain has had such a huge impact
minister there's there's you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned blue dream blue dot I mean we
could we can blue ourselves in the face
[SPEAKER_02]: here there with all the blues for sure um
and and yeah it was you know a short
[SPEAKER_02]: flower indica uh just a great a great
plant yeah really special plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: more you dig into it the more it sort of
actually becomes really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's like it doesn't have uh the
afghani in it that's in a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: afghani genetics it's almost like you know
it doesn't have afghani one in it it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have the same afghani many other
people have worked with it's got the uh
[SPEAKER_00]: the the oregon purple tie in it which is
just such a mythical strain in its own
[SPEAKER_00]: right it's all of the individual pieces
are so interesting and again it's so so
[SPEAKER_00]: tried and true it's really a strain that
has continued to involve over time as dj
[SPEAKER_00]: and his son have both continued to work it
but again I think one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: values of it is that we still have access
to males and females um you know notably
[SPEAKER_00]: dj's selections of females are out there
in circulation maybe not necessarily easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to get but they are out there and uh
likewise his breeding parents are still
[SPEAKER_00]: around which really a unique consideration
for a strain that has this uh body of
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy associated with it yeah and and as
he puts it the finished product has a very
[SPEAKER_02]: fruity aroma and taste of blueberries
producing a notable and pleasantly
[SPEAKER_02]: euphoric high of the highest quality it's
a very long-lasting resistibly tolerance
[SPEAKER_02]: build-up always enjoyable blueberry has a
long shelf life stores well over extended
[SPEAKER_02]: periods a long cure enhancing the flavors
in effect winner of course of the 2000
[SPEAKER_02]: high time scale uh we sell the shit out
and it's one of the most ripped off
[SPEAKER_02]: strains as well like um there's other
people that will sell other things that
[SPEAKER_02]: sell a blueberry and they don't claim it
to be shorts blueberry or they explain it
[SPEAKER_02]: as a tiny earthy strain which is exactly
the opposite of it um and then like you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned so not only is the most ripped
off strain of all times but uh it's also
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the most used you know other
people have used it in their process over
[SPEAKER_02]: everything um you can go through my
catalogue and just you know for looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said if you load up the catalogue
and throw it in the galaxy real quick yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of that stuff is going to come back
because it been around since the 70s so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been there and it's you know when
cannabis was a lot different than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: today yeah 100 and there's so many little
various facets of it that we're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to fail to even do justice in discussion
wise like i've got a mate in the uk who
[SPEAKER_00]: always reminds me that because i i
frequently say on the show you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: love cheese in the uk he goes bro we don't
grow cheese here anymore we grow blue
[SPEAKER_00]: cheese it's like cheese in seed form but
better and and so you'll see as you
[SPEAKER_00]: reference blue cheese one of the most
knocked off recreated cheese um all just
[SPEAKER_00]: fema seeds out there in general you know
every sort of spain feminized country uh
[SPEAKER_00]: company is going to offer a blue cheese
because it's just synonymous so uh with
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk so yeah it's it's like the more you
look into it the more you start to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise by where you see it popping up
and you think you've nailed them all right
[SPEAKER_02]: right you're like okay that was a big one
so you know you name another one like oh
[SPEAKER_02]: shit i forgot what that one too i mean
it's just it's really has been used i
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's once again it's been it's it's
been a home run since since the 70s i mean
[SPEAKER_02]: kim 91 91 tk we're putting that around the
90s as well so this has been one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: older strains that um you know and and
also you got to get credit to the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatnot but people back then weren't
they didn't have these giant facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: like exotic or like you know uh jbz they
don't have they can't grow a thousand or
[SPEAKER_02]: five thousand plants out and then pick
that one you know some of these guys were
[SPEAKER_02]: using tents you know if they if they grew
more than 20 they were drawing some heat
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure and for them to grow it for seed
production they could be growing it for
[SPEAKER_02]: weed weed production and getting paid that
was you know even something even crazier
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you mean you're growing a plant
for seeds that's nuts but if you wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve it if you wanted seeds next year
well then you made them this year and so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what you know a lot of guys did
that on one or two of them so yeah great
[SPEAKER_02]: strain great addition and definitely uh
you know definitely has a place in that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the old time for sure fantastic well
congrats dj short killer strain love it
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry turps definitely up there for me
it's one of the best always and yeah it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just it's just it's just a really great
strain and it's it's in literally
[SPEAKER_00]: everything all righty so moving on to our
next category we have the most anticipated
[SPEAKER_00]: seed drop of the year so in terms of the
most anticipated seed drop number of
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates this year and i think one that
definitely sort of caught my eye was it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a joint one it's the the nl5
reproductions so there's notably inspector
[SPEAKER_00]: and matt rye it's nl5 reproduction that's
being done by csi or inspector and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there was also the todd mccormick nl
reproduction both using seed stock that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from greg so i know there's been a
bit of anticipation around those ones so
[SPEAKER_00]: that was definitely a contender in my mind
and for people who don't know who greg is
[SPEAKER_02]: greg is greg mccallister so greg is greg
mccallister the guy i know of to be
[SPEAKER_02]: credited with the nl and the nl5 and then
the entire line of nls and when he was
[SPEAKER_02]: when he first came to me uh we spoke and
he told me he was responsible for the nls
[SPEAKER_02]: and the nl5 and i said wait a minute here
i said so you're telling me that you you
[SPEAKER_02]: did this that i mean i said most people
are telling me that they're using a cut of
[SPEAKER_02]: this and i have to vet them that they're
using a cut you're telling me that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for these uh sure you are sure
you are okay let's smoke some more uh
[SPEAKER_02]: because then i'm like how do i vet this
guy who's gonna so i asked him do you know
[SPEAKER_02]: adam dunn because everybody knows adam
dunn he has no clue who adam dunn is but
[SPEAKER_02]: if we think about it he was doing shit in
the 70s he wouldn't know who adam dunn is
[SPEAKER_02]: adam dunn didn't come around until the 90s
this guy was doing shit like in 72 when he
[SPEAKER_02]: came back from the war and so who do you
vet him through who you got this crazy old
[SPEAKER_02]: dude telling you made the shit but the guy
who made the shit is probably going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: this crazy old dude and so i'm thinking
i'm thinking i'm thinking operation green
[SPEAKER_02]: merchant wolf seal fucking farmer in the
sky guy he's trying since the million tips
[SPEAKER_02]: and so i called wolf i said wolf this guy
tells me this guy made the nls he's like
[SPEAKER_02]: oh breg i said that's his name he's like
yep yeah that's who did it i i was right
[SPEAKER_02]: with him and he did that in 72 when i was
we're on the island there and i was like
[SPEAKER_02]: really i said well he's contacted me he's
like oh yeah i told him too i was like oh
[SPEAKER_02]: shit well he has and so yeah so that's so
that's great so sorry so i guess breg
[SPEAKER_02]: going to find i wasn't aware of it until
after it happened but i guess that breg
[SPEAKER_02]: gave riot and those guys some seeds is
that what you're telling me yeah i believe
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah i wasn't familiar i wasn't aware
that he had given them uh since i'd heard
[SPEAKER_02]: that he had possibly had but um so so how
does it become an inspector in riot then i
[SPEAKER_00]: think i mean i i think that he so he
definitely gave some to toad because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know they're mates and they chat and i
believe that likewise his friends with
[SPEAKER_00]: matt and he gave matt some of the seeds
and i think matt passed them on to uh
[SPEAKER_00]: caleb csi because uh you know inspectors
so well known for his ability to reproduce
[SPEAKER_00]: old strains that uh yeah it just ended up
becoming the two of them doing it awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's awesome because yeah caleb is
since i i mean that guy that guy holds his
[SPEAKER_02]: own for sure um when his stock comes in it
flies out he's a great dude um so so yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: so definitely and just because who doesn't
love the nls i mean those were you know
[SPEAKER_02]: and i guess the story behind them because
that's the first thing done when i'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask him was why the numbers you said
only he named them one through eleven
[SPEAKER_02]: based on size you know the one was the
shortest one the other was the tallest one
[SPEAKER_02]: the five would be in the middle would you
think about if you're breeding and using
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff the one in the middle is
probably going to be the one that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: used the most yeah interesting stuff well
you know a hot contender for the the
[SPEAKER_00]: winner but i think that to be honest the
winner for me and for a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been talking to is it's a bit of a uh
a washout a blowout to be honest because i
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't seen the amount of momentum this
drop got for a very long time and so i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: very happy to say that the winner of the
most anticipated c drop award for the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021-22 period goes to none other than
crickets and cicada with their puck back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross one lineup absolutely destroying it
including the bx2 as well as a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: other crosses to things like sensi star
hash plant 13 which was actually i'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a mad plug here uh mr bob and hannah
bolt just so incredibly generous donated
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 packs of their seeds to our patreon
just just to give to our patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: supporters because they're like we love
the show we want to support the listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: so we gave out 30 packs to our listeners
of their unreleased hash plant 13 cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: the back cross one male they did um hash
plant 13 being incredibly rare clone top
[SPEAKER_00]: dog and uh both mr bob talk very highly of
it but you know this drop in general had
[SPEAKER_00]: some bangers in it including the uh the
rare red red lebanese hash plant cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: the puck the sensi star killer and uh if
you've been following mr bob's instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: he's been posting up some absolute bangers
with uh this northern lights female he's
[SPEAKER_00]: been using so i believe there might be a
part two to this drop coming featuring
[SPEAKER_00]: some additional strains or at least i'm
secretly wishing they'll be but uh they've
[SPEAKER_02]: just crushed it all around so i completely
slept on this one uh when when my guy rob
[SPEAKER_02]: was doing the ordering um it it was you
know uh the puck back crosses what what
[SPEAKER_02]: what what what's puck um bucks uh skelly
has plant crossed with nl1 and those
[SPEAKER_02]: strings are out there right like it's not
it's not nothing trendy it's not nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: hype shit it's not you know it's skelly
hash plant nl1 but man i smoked some i i
[SPEAKER_02]: think he gave me some that shit is good it
is heavy it looks amazing it is it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's the kind that makes that that
donk sound like when you're cutting in
[SPEAKER_02]: turkey trays you know it's uh it's it's
just uh and and i think he had four or
[SPEAKER_02]: five different uh different of the crosses
there when i met him and smoked with him
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh there were it wasn't one that
outshined the other they were all just
[SPEAKER_02]: massively great it wasn't like just some
nugs were great they were all awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff all good stuff and then whether it's
smoking i smoke a fair amount of weed uh
[SPEAKER_02]: it definitely knocked my dick in the dirt
it's it's old i mean it's two old strains
[SPEAKER_02]: right but it's two old strands done damn
well and from the guy who would have the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality of those old strains from the
librarian so um and then like i said i was
[SPEAKER_02]: blessed enough to have to smoke some and i
will definitely say uh it got me high yes
[SPEAKER_00]: it is undoubtedly some killer killer stuff
so shout out to crickets and cicada mr bob
[SPEAKER_00]: hemphill and hannah bolt crushing it as
always onto our next award being hottest
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder on the block this is a prize that
historically just to clear up any
[SPEAKER_00]: misconceptions historically it doesn't go
to someone who's like in their first year
[SPEAKER_00]: of breeding it's it's often people who
have been around for a while but have
[SPEAKER_00]: really sort of started to get a bit of
momentum maybe even caused a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: splash with a seed drop or two so this is
for people who are really you know
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get to the levels of where
maybe we think they should be because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're often really good breeders
maybe a little under recognized but often
[SPEAKER_00]: some exciting names in the mix i know that
last year i believed the winner was soul
[SPEAKER_00]: fire and heck we we killed it with that
pick he's going on to do that bahama mama
[SPEAKER_02]: cross which just looks insane i know if
you want shit that washes uh his his stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: is insane it's frost as hell uh great
stuff it flies out the bahama mama crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: are awesome um it's just it's a nice plant
uh it puts in a lot of work a lot of hard
[SPEAKER_02]: work and he definitely well deserved and
we definitely has is is uh one of my top
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 for sure uh great great guy yeah
definitely and years prior to that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: even had in years prior to that we've even
had none other than our friend on the
[SPEAKER_00]: final frontier aka bean brain sweep this
award so definitely some big hitters in
[SPEAKER_00]: the prior winners of this award and there
was a few names that sort of came to mind
[SPEAKER_00]: when i was thinking about the newcomers of
the year i definitely want to give a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out max yields the guy who created oreos
and collab with thug pug to make pure
[SPEAKER_00]: michigan you can't deny we've all seen
those strains popping up here and there
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing pretty well so kudos to you
max yields you've been doing some good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff however for me there's there's
another name i've got in mind but i'd love
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear did you have any honorable
mentions mr bean uh you put me on a spot
[SPEAKER_02]: here uh you know of course all my guys
everybody they picked up in last year i
[SPEAKER_02]: think is an epic newcomer um try to check
them out i can't if i mention one i'm the
[SPEAKER_02]: chapter mention ten of women so i can't i
can do one in particular uh there's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite child right um i will say the one
that you're picked for that has done very
[SPEAKER_02]: well uh we've always done well in our
picks i think you've got a good one that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're about to about to name but uh yeah
i would just uh kind of i think i think
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that we both have in common is the
one i've got yeah other than that i can't
[SPEAKER_02]: pick more than one favorite child i'll
look in trouble yeah you'll end up
[SPEAKER_00]: stealing the thunder from me that's okay
that's all right um well let's get on to
[SPEAKER_00]: it i think that the the hottest new
breeder on the block award goes to none
[SPEAKER_00]: other than bloom seeds mr harry palms who
has just done a momentous job crushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: over the past few years in fact but it's
good to see that he's starting to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition from the masses his work as
well has really surprised me and how
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty it is the consistently high quality
i've seen some mates grow it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all blown away they're i even know
one guy he's like disciple of the church
[SPEAKER_00]: of bloom he won't touch anything except
bloom so you got to be doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: right if you can get people to have that
level of passion for your brand and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know he's got some um some notable history
behind himself um having formerly been a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of only having been a part of the
tropicana cookies creation this is a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: who's been around for a while and has
really put in his due diligence and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: great to see that bloom seeds is really
starting to take off with the masses and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing some cool strains come out of their
stable such as the grape cream cake uh
[SPEAKER_00]: i've also seen that his garlic sour
cookies are sick i've also seen him do
[SPEAKER_00]: some other cool stuff with uh what is it
purple full stack that looks dope as well
[SPEAKER_02]: there's purple ice water shines that thing
is great sticky grapes um back in that bar
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a big bag big bag the kushman's cross
of course with the great cream cake um so
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's uh and and he's done he's done a
lot of shit in the past and like you said
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of really a lot of prostitutes
in this table a lot of prostitutes yeah i
[SPEAKER_00]: think bloom has got a reputation for being
like super terpy super resny that's what i
[SPEAKER_00]: think when i think of bloom so yeah
concentrate guys this is the one for you
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure but again you know great to see
someone like harry who's been around for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while really starting to get momentum two
years in a row now we're going towards a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate guys yeah look that that might
be the trend and that plays into the
[SPEAKER_00]: general sort of uh macro politics and
movement of the scene you know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing bigger facilities and uh bigger
facilities can do have the capacity to do
[SPEAKER_00]: big volumes of concentrates and as a
result strains that are concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: orientated more likely to get run there's
also just a growing uh group of
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts who are really into the
concentrates you know like i think i think
[SPEAKER_00]: people are still growing you know we
definitely haven't reached our peak
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate enthusiast uh curve yet before
we start swinging back to flower i think
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still on the up and up well i think
i think they're because there's a science
[SPEAKER_02]: behind it right there's different ways to
do it i mean we can all go in our
[SPEAKER_02]: backyards and blow some blow some you know
some some butane and try to uh explode our
[SPEAKER_02]: house and get a little a little uh
concentrate but to take that process and
[SPEAKER_02]: refine it and make it such an intricate
specialty deal that it is today and and
[SPEAKER_02]: then by using different because you know
what you put in which and what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get out you know i've always said
some of these concentrate guys that make
[SPEAKER_02]: that that make those strains were great
because the you know a frenchie started
[SPEAKER_02]: with the fishing autos gear right cuban
was using exotics gear cuban's great but
[SPEAKER_02]: he had an exotic spear and so if you know
what you start with is what you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: put out so you know a lot i see blooming
in a lot of concentrates so um that and
[SPEAKER_02]: and now that we have like you were saying
the ability to run five thousands because
[SPEAKER_02]: if we rewind the clock which i worked with
a lot older breeders these guys were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in their tents and they had 10 12
15 to work with and and for them to have
[SPEAKER_02]: chose what they chose and for us to be
aware it was as excellent for that but now
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking facilities of 5 000 and you
can really sort out that one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: different i mean all these are plants and
they're all marijuana plants then and then
[SPEAKER_02]: all this planet at that but there's that
one that's just different than all the
[SPEAKER_02]: others and that's how i've heard it told
when you go into a room is that you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: just it's just different and you're like
well what does that mean you're like you
[SPEAKER_02]: just see it when you see it and so and to
have that ability to run those numbers and
[SPEAKER_02]: then just get rid of the others either
through putting in the flower in a shell
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever it may be um you know that's
why these guys that we've nominated to be
[SPEAKER_02]: best growers in the year uh the year in
the past um because they're working with
[SPEAKER_02]: the giant phenons because that's what it
comes down to if you want something that
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else has then then you grab a
clone if you want something that's yours
[SPEAKER_00]: you grab it that's it that's it plant more
seeds but uh shout out to bloom you know
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some good work as always for sure
for sure so on to our next category we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give a quick little detour being
that it's been you know i think probably
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 months now uh since our last episode
unfortunately we have had a few veterans
[SPEAKER_00]: of the scene bid us farewell and so we bid
farewell to a true pioneer of concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and notably the hashish scene frenchy
cannoli who unfortunately passed away
[SPEAKER_00]: early last year and frenchy was a pivotal
man in the scene in really reigniting the
[SPEAKER_00]: fire under the artisanal hash and
concentrate scene him and his wife held
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous workshops were affiliated with
various crews such as aficionados as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as many others who really tried to push
the limits and to raise greater awareness
[SPEAKER_00]: in the consumer's mind around not just the
quality of artisanally produced products
[SPEAKER_00]: but also to pay homage and respect the
traditional practices that have produced
[SPEAKER_00]: them over the years and the way in which
the application of these sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous knowledges can be tailored to
each product to really bring its merits
[SPEAKER_00]: and qualities to the forefront so it is
with a heavy heart that we say valet
[SPEAKER_02]: frenchy cannoli yeah frenchy um i was
lucky enough to uh work with him to have
[SPEAKER_02]: dinner with him to know him to have met
him to and come to parties with him um he
[SPEAKER_02]: he was he was the one gentleman when he
started talking everybody shut up because
[SPEAKER_02]: for one he talked really quietly and for
two of course his name implies he was
[SPEAKER_02]: french and so you would talk very quiet
you know and you do this and you do this
[SPEAKER_02]: and you do this and everybody would just
shut up i mean he was like entire
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurants would be quiet whenever he
talked because you want to hear what he
[SPEAKER_02]: said he wanted to get that information out
of him and and so it was i mean i've i've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen him quiet many of the crowd just like
just by talking and so that's uh i don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know is that is that just kind of a
gentleman that commanded the space around
[SPEAKER_02]: him and and humbly so like was was not of
that i'm the coolest person was just you
[SPEAKER_02]: know happy to be where i was and uh so i
remember he he lost a one gram temple ball
[SPEAKER_02]: in a party i had before uh a high times
event we had a free party and uh the rumor
[SPEAKER_02]: is is he left the one one gram temple ball
somewhere in the house and left it we
[SPEAKER_02]: never found it so that's a you know fun
story but um you know he he i knew him
[SPEAKER_02]: through his work with the Christianado
with uh having booths with leo and um the
[SPEAKER_02]: the awards they won and the caps they won
um the dinners we'd have after cups and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff so yes i was very uh lost a good one
and they all go to her early you know we
[SPEAKER_02]: all wish we had more time the frenchie
definitely one of the ones to tour in his
[SPEAKER_02]: ascii shin you know lost our ascii shin
workshops for a lot of people attended
[SPEAKER_02]: them um i think that maybe that's where
your legacy lives is in teaching people
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge and people remember like bog
like people that we've had in the past you
[SPEAKER_02]: know sub with his videos so we'll always
go down because how many people i can't
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you i can't tell you how many people
tell me that they watched subs read nerd
[SPEAKER_02]: videos like and and whether sub knew it or
not by him doing those videos he created a
[SPEAKER_02]: cult that people were able to watch when
when youtube was cool and so you know
[SPEAKER_02]: passing knowledge down the way and i think
the three guys we've had in the hall of
[SPEAKER_02]: fame or you know the four guys you had
have all been our uh the house sorry i
[SPEAKER_02]: guess the you know the three guys that we
lost recently um bog sub and frenchie were
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing they all had in common is they
were all great teachers they took their
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge and shared it with people so you
know i'm sure we've lost others but maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe that's what we take from this is
that it's cool to know everything but to
[SPEAKER_02]: take that knowledge and share with other
people that's what gets you remembered
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah definitely a very altruistic and
selfless sort of act to be a teacher and
[SPEAKER_00]: as you said one that will certainly leave
you in high regards and uh in warm favor
[SPEAKER_00]: with people so moving on to our final
award of the year the breeder of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: the big one the big bopper this year
there's there's a number of people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: in contention and i think that it's
important to note that uh this award goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to people for a variety of factors it goes
for you know like how popular they are uh
[SPEAKER_00]: how good the work is not just like you
know otherwise uh bloody candy rain would
[SPEAKER_00]: have won that year right it's not just
about like how interested people are it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also about how good the work is and does
it germinate um it's also about a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of like logistical and technical things
you know is this unique stock uh so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very multifaceted sort of award and
so i think that some of the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: will get the sort of honorable shout outs
or the top mentions in my books will go to
[SPEAKER_00]: chris of compound genetics i wanted to
give an honorable mention to him he's done
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool work with the apples and bananas
as well as some of his other crosses he's
[SPEAKER_00]: done i think that we've seen a lot of
derivative work from other people and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not to say i'm not interested in it
but it certainly has amassed a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: following and has even had other people
sort of doing similar crosses utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: those cuts when they've got access to them
likewise i think that given that chris of
[SPEAKER_00]: compound has worked with cookies you know
you can't can't argue that's going to help
[SPEAKER_02]: with the old reputation yeah uh definitely
compounds the apple apple's banana has has
[SPEAKER_02]: been uh it's definitely uh for being
released so late it was in a lot of gear
[SPEAKER_02]: surprisingly that's not used a lot in a
lot of breeding projects yet it was
[SPEAKER_02]: released that you know chris of course had
a great booth uh in the little cup i was
[SPEAKER_02]: part of his nft he was one of the first
breeders i knew that was actually pushing
[SPEAKER_02]: nfts i got an nft to his pre-party uh we
sold this we sold his packs um good good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and he's been doing you know into
good stuff in the past as well and um you
[SPEAKER_02]: know definitely uh a bit almost first a
bit almost first yeah he he's very much up
[SPEAKER_00]: there he's been doing some huge waves and
i think this year is the year that he
[SPEAKER_00]: really did come to the forefront in terms
of being a really close front runner um
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give some other sort of honorable
shout outs um soul fire you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped it before he crushed it with the
bahama mama line this year honorable shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to exotic mike the scotty two hottie
has caused a lot of momentum i know that
[SPEAKER_00]: james bean will be happy that i've
mentioned that because he is a big exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: mike fan also shout out strong strong on
his page right now strong on the page
[SPEAKER_02]: right now yeah my god i might just crush
it he just crushes it just good stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: likewise a shout out to mr skunk va who's
i think probably added maybe even six to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight lines to his repertoire using some
interesting females crossed to the old
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite cam and i think i read it i think
i read a comment on his page earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: someone asked you know like what are you
sort of looking to do with your cam lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and he left a great answer which said you
know i want to impart all the best
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities of the cam without dominating
the mother still letting the mother shine
[SPEAKER_00]: through a bit so uh yeah some really nice
crosses coming out from the lucky dog camp
[SPEAKER_00]: but i wanted to give a a second really
close second like tied tied second sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to mean gene who's had an
absolutely killer year he's brought out
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool new lines in collaboration with
other people he's bought out some outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: specific lines which is really cool to see
breeders really honing in on their craft
[SPEAKER_00]: he's got some cool stickers that sort of
indicate like hey you know do what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want with these seeds but i think they're
best suited outdoors and he's also
[SPEAKER_00]: released some interesting genetics that
are not related to some of the other work
[SPEAKER_00]: he's done so really injecting some fresh
blood into his stable and notably i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: excited for some of the pink champagne s1
hybrids he's done he found a nice seed in
[SPEAKER_00]: some pink champagne a strain that's near
and dear to my heart i love it also goes
[SPEAKER_00]: by the name the phantom and uh yeah
beautiful stuff check out me and gene he's
[SPEAKER_02]: done some cool work shout out i know me
and gene from his uh from his days working
[SPEAKER_02]: with aficionado and um just you know i
used to explain it as as as i think that
[SPEAKER_02]: guy pops a five gallon bucket of seeds
every year like i really really do because
[SPEAKER_02]: once again we're going back to phenol
hunting we're going back to finding that
[SPEAKER_02]: that different thing um and gene's a great
guy i've worked in a lot of fundraising
[SPEAKER_02]: things um his he has he has a home run
with you bear i mean the marketing behind
[SPEAKER_02]: it um the it's just it's a great strain
but it's so great and he's done such good
[SPEAKER_02]: things with it that he can't that he can't
sell it now right because he's done such
[SPEAKER_02]: good things that he's done he's donated so
much and so you know that's a guy who's
[SPEAKER_02]: unselfishly taken home run and and donated
back to the community if you will um he's
[SPEAKER_02]: always on different panels and i don't
know and that's a he's definitely a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder's breeder like if the guy that
works here and is going to find something
[SPEAKER_02]: different and uh you know that's
definitely a big fan of his for sure hell
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so without further delay the breeder
of the year for the 2021-2022 period goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to none other than crickets and cicada mr
bob hamphill and hannah boll absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting it out of the park you know they
they started off the year strong releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: some unique hybrids like the light of
venus which was a cool purple urkel uh
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed with a bit of kabool kush in the
mix some really cool elements going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there sticking to their tried and tested
recipe of using some cool old school
[SPEAKER_00]: old-worldly genetics mixed with some old
staples and more recently they've done the
[SPEAKER_00]: puck back cross one drop which sold like
hot fires across absolutely every seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank it was sold out within you know 15
minutes across the board often even less
[SPEAKER_00]: time than that and some beautiful looking
flower coming up on their instagram that
[SPEAKER_00]: are the results of them growing it out i
cannot tell you how many people messaged
[SPEAKER_00]: me and said i caught up with mr bob at one
of the organic seminars he tried he gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me some of their bud and it was the most
memorable weed i've tried in a very long
[SPEAKER_02]: time yeah uh i i really enjoy their work
um he's he was and people who don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: can go back and listen to a couple of your
other podcasting of using pat with him
[SPEAKER_02]: where he goes into his history with with
coastal seeds um i was lucky enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: have met with him uh earlier this year uh
in march uh he gave me uh selections of of
[SPEAKER_02]: the uh of the current puck cross back is
our back crossing um you know he he's a
[SPEAKER_02]: librarian for sure and and you mentioned
that hannibal which is his wife um and and
[SPEAKER_02]: she does a lot of the work you know i
asked i asked duke i was like what what
[SPEAKER_02]: should i get him he was like sharpies i
was like sharpies what do you mean well a
[SPEAKER_02]: guy that does cuts and does clones and has
a library i need sharpies because he
[SPEAKER_02]: writes and writes on solo cups right so
he's like sharpies and of course and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know he's known as librarian she's got you
know 100 different females or whatnot
[SPEAKER_02]: plants he's just keeping and uh because he
doesn't want to lose them to the to the to
[SPEAKER_02]: the period of time you know and then we he
has he has he has things doesn't even like
[SPEAKER_02]: he's keeping just because he doesn't want
them lost and to keep a library like that
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's not a giant facility and so to
keep a library like that you know i'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: wasted in a room but but not earning it to
keep in a room is is a benefit for anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that needs to use it and one of the
coolest things that uh that that i really
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed when i met with him this last time
is that he stressed to me he wanted people
[SPEAKER_02]: to use his product like he wanted people
to breathe his breath gear and i was like
[SPEAKER_02]: wait a minute a lot of people don't want
that they don't want to use like no no i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm preservationist like like the pressure
of pakistan you spoke of that was an open
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination that he did because he wants
to reserve that line he wants to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: that available so you don't lose it
doesn't get tainted and so and he wants
[SPEAKER_02]: you and his his his starting stock for new
breeders or new guys coming into the scene
[SPEAKER_02]: that want starting stock to breed with i
think you you couldn't go wrong with with
[SPEAKER_02]: anything from his lines i mean it's just
it's older stock and older crosses but
[SPEAKER_02]: they're done right the guy who should
happen i mean no question um so much so
[SPEAKER_02]: that i know that earlier we discussed uh i
saved this one for you here uh earlier we
[SPEAKER_02]: discussed the nl series right uh i didn't
know that greg had sent packs to mccormick
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh riot i also know greg obviously i
also got a pack of seeds about that same
[SPEAKER_02]: time which greg got mad at me excited
thinking because greg i told you i didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know they were coming you packed them like
an old schooler so i didn't know them but
[SPEAKER_02]: they were i wasn't there i didn't get them
but thank you now i know what they are i
[SPEAKER_02]: found them since i found them of course i
want to grow them because if they went
[SPEAKER_02]: there say they are then well i would want
them but the person that needs to have
[SPEAKER_02]: them would be to me this guy would be
fucking mr bob impel so i gave him the
[SPEAKER_02]: packs that were given to me by graham
mccallister so he has now the same packs
[SPEAKER_02]: that riot and mccormick got so we'll see
what he does with that little nifty ones
[SPEAKER_02]: but i figured you know you know who should
who should have these then a librarian i
[SPEAKER_02]: won't i will you know he he knows so much
about planning she's a talk to him he can
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you the different what what this
shows and what that shows and what the
[SPEAKER_02]: Lebanese shows and what that shows him and
he's just he's really he's not the most
[SPEAKER_02]: excited uh amplified guy but he doesn't
really get excited over much things but
[SPEAKER_02]: but man his weed just fucking gets me high
i tell you what good stuff uh yeah there
[SPEAKER_02]: is teamwork on that one's for two like i
said you're keeping around a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: mothers right or not talking about a
hundred plants a hundred mothers that's
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not paying anything to keep those
around so shout out to him and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent choice excellent choice yeah
definitely a huge shout out and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really exciting to hear that you've been
able to get the seeds into the librarian's
[SPEAKER_00]: hands hopefully we'll see some really
special work come out of that and uh yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: just to echo the sentiment you know so
awesome to have uh mr bob hemphill and
[SPEAKER_00]: hannibal take it they've really been
staples in the scenes for years dating
[SPEAKER_00]: back to their work with coastal and before
that even and uh now really getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition for all the hard work they've
been putting in over the years preserving
[SPEAKER_00]: and creating some fantastic strains
[SPEAKER_00]: all righty friends we're back at it here
with the winner of the 2021-22 breeder of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year awards mr bob hemphill and
hannibal of crickets and cicada
[SPEAKER_01]: congratulations and thank you so much for
joining us thank you it's an honor it's uh
[SPEAKER_00]: very much appreciated look i feel like i
would not be the first to say that this
[SPEAKER_00]: has like been a long time come and i think
there's a lot of heads in the scene who
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you guys have been putting in a
lot of work over the years and like myself
[SPEAKER_00]: are really really grateful to see the the
wider community really embracing it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's killer to see did you ever expect
that you would get this sort of reception
[SPEAKER_01]: to the puck crosses i had no idea that um
there would be this many people interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in the project and honestly i had uh you
know no expectations of it turning out as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as it did it's just a you know
amazing thing yeah look it it really
[SPEAKER_00]: caught me by surprise because of the fact
that you know the skelly hash plant it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been around for a while and i think there
have been a small number of crosses done
[SPEAKER_00]: with it but i'm not sure if the demand for
those crosses really reflected what you
[SPEAKER_00]: got here i guess you're the best person to
ask do you think i mean i know that puck
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah was quite popular but do you think
that other puck crosses really sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: gave you any idea of how this was going to
go you know i i think people really got
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about the fact that it's really
inbred uh good breeding stock and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: to get something that uh is you know
inbred and inbred to be potent um just
[SPEAKER_00]: appealed to people yeah hugely hugely i
also have been thinking that i think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a bit unfortunate but i think
since never was passed people have sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: re-examined a lot of the older work with
like a microscope and are like hey this is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like really good stuff and
there's like a more general sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness would you say that you've seen
any of that at all i guess i'll also just
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly add in like in relation to puck
sure but i've also seen people you know
[SPEAKER_00]: quite keen on the nls and the nl5s and
stuff do you think people are more keen on
[SPEAKER_01]: the older work at the moment you know it
that always happens with an artist when
[SPEAKER_01]: they pass people appreciate their work um
but to be honest you know he's been an
[SPEAKER_01]: inspiration to me since the 90s and um
always looked at him as the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis breeder of all time and um you
know since the 90s i've been trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect as many clones from him as
possible and you know there's not many of
[SPEAKER_01]: them left but any of them that stayed
around this long are truly as good as any
[SPEAKER_01]: new hype strain there is so um you know
the the puck project is just continuing
[SPEAKER_01]: his work um i didn't add anything else in
there that he didn't add and um you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it just kept getting better with the
inbreeding so um you know taking out their
[SPEAKER_01]: his style of breeding um really paid off
hell yeah i can only imagine we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: see some people sort of uh recreate the
breeding steps you've taken to do this but
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe with some other clones i'd be
interested to hear are there any other old
[SPEAKER_00]: school lines that you're sort of keen to
work with now that you've seen with you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the skelly that this is like a viable
sort of commercial pathway people are keen
[SPEAKER_01]: on this sort of work anything new on the
horizon well you know um the goal is to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a bunch of old clones in the seed form
i'm working on the master kush project
[SPEAKER_01]: right now um pollen is flying right now to
make the back cross one off the clone i've
[SPEAKER_01]: been holding for 20 years and um then uh
purple hindu kush working that one and uh
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a whole bunch more but those are
uh some of the ones that that and sensi
[SPEAKER_01]: star the sensi star clone i have i also
have that at bx1 right now oh wow what
[SPEAKER_00]: male did you use for the initial cross on
the sensi the broodex oh god what a good
[SPEAKER_01]: pairing yeah um i also made some f2s off a
few select broodex females and um really
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about you know digging into the
f2s and you know the back cross i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: take that and um make a bx 2 and that's
where i'll hopefully make it available if
[SPEAKER_01]: it passes testing and i'll take the bx1
and cross it to the sensi star cut um wick
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me and a bunch of other good clones
too a bunch of old school stock yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds killer and i mean you just
mentioned wick i i have to be honest he's
[SPEAKER_00]: been posting some cool stuff any chance we
might ever see you guys collaborating
[SPEAKER_00]: together or do you sort of feel like it's
already happening because you guys share a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of cuts you know it definitely is
already happening and um he has you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: mother collection he's been holding as
long as i've been holding mine and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: been putting in work and um he really you
know loves the plan he's one of the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that does it for the right reason so um
you know if you're really into crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: sativas that's a really good place to look
right there he's um making some really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool things right now hell yeah but you
know what this interview is about you and
[SPEAKER_00]: i think you've been making some really
cool things right now so let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it i seen you posted the uh the tom hill
haze cross and pollination you did tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more about that well the
common health taste i made um an open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination years ago with the um original
three original packs from him and then um
[SPEAKER_01]: when i did that open pollination i stuck
in some old timers phase female so i made
[SPEAKER_01]: tom hills f2s and then f1s of the old
timers and the tom hills phase i just got
[SPEAKER_01]: into refreshing my seed stock and i made
f3s of the tom hills phase that's
[SPEAKER_01]: positronics f4 really excited i'm gonna
let a few of those out just so the line
[SPEAKER_01]: stays alive there's not many people that
have kept that line alive and um also
[SPEAKER_01]: right now i'm working on making f2s of the
old timers by the tom hills haze and i
[SPEAKER_01]: also um have some tom hills haze cross to
original haze in there too also some pure
[SPEAKER_01]: original haze to you know hopefully add
what um genetic diversity is left into the
[SPEAKER_01]: pure haze population and um you know
honestly i'm just gonna treat this haze
[SPEAKER_01]: like open pollination lane race work and
i'm gonna put it out there and i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: hope hope that some breeders are gonna
take it and work it forward um because it
[SPEAKER_01]: really needs to be looked through at large
populations at that point and selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: the best for making f2s and outcrosses i
think it'll be some amazing breeding stock
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah certainly i know that there's been um
some other haze releases and some people
[SPEAKER_00]: have enjoyed them some people have sort of
said oh not quite what they wanted so
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe this will be more of a successful
route for them just as a quick follow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: did you notice much discrepancies between
the like you know the positronics haze and
[SPEAKER_01]: the old timers haze or were they fairly
similar no um you know i've done as much
[SPEAKER_01]: research as i can about the old timers and
it's really you know who knows what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: um it's very similar to haze it might be a
haze outcross or some of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: columbians that made haze um it was
slightly different than the tom hills
[SPEAKER_01]: positronics haze when i grew them out
together there's you know more sativa i
[SPEAKER_01]: would say that that that old timer one
haze is more sativa um tom hills haze is
[SPEAKER_01]: very sativa in itself um i think else is
the best out of what i've seen from
[SPEAKER_01]: samples of original haze and what i saw
old timer one haze and um i think tom
[SPEAKER_00]: hills is the best wow that's really
exciting and i guess one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts that jumped to mind to people who
follow you on instagram were are we ever
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see you recreate like an nl5 haze
you know i put um the nl2 cut from jim
[SPEAKER_01]: ortega and with the tom hills haze open
pollination and i also put in uh nl1 cut
[SPEAKER_01]: from aka bean brains and so i do have
seeds of those and so yeah we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get some of those tested and um we'll see
how nice they turn out fingers crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah out of curiosity i mean like i don't
have a ton of experience with the nl2 for
[SPEAKER_00]: example but would you just if you had to
use your imagination expect that those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds would come out similar to the nl5
haze but maybe like a bit less sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy or what do you imagine they'll
come out like man if they come out
[SPEAKER_01]: anything as good as uh what neville did
with that nl5 haze you know i'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely happy i think that's one of the
best breedings in history nl5 haze you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at how many clones of nl5 haze are
still around in their pure form and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just extremely potent and then uh
you look what jj did from top dog he took
[SPEAKER_01]: that nl haze and made the nigerian haze so
you know it's amazing breeding stock and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the cuts up stood the time as
good as anything ever created in history
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah definitely some mammoth stock for
sure so a lot of people had messaged me
[SPEAKER_00]: and asked it looks like there might be a
part two of the puck drop happening
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've been posting some sort of
newer crosses that weren't in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: part is that what the fans can expect or
is that more just some personal r and d no
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 i'm gonna bring more of the puck the
puck bx3 i'm gonna bring that to the
[SPEAKER_01]: public after testing fingers crossed and
then i'm hitting a bunch of clones and um
[SPEAKER_01]: the same ones that really clicked well and
then a bunch of other ones that i think
[SPEAKER_01]: will click well you know like pre-98 bubba
the sensi star from wick shoreline you
[SPEAKER_01]: know some really i think stuff that i have
uh high hopes for also skunk one clone
[SPEAKER_00]: that also came from wack yeah wow i
remember i grew out a shoreline s1 like 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago when i first started growing i
think it came from uh devil's harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: devil's harvest crew and i i think they're
legit even though maybe a checkered past
[SPEAKER_00]: but i remember that was a very unique
plant even in my very newbie-ness at
[SPEAKER_00]: growing i could tell it smelt totally
unlike anything else is that what the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoreline's like as the original clone or
did i just get lucky with that s1 man it
[SPEAKER_01]: it reminds me of that old school 90s smell
you know like that really good stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: most everything in the 90s was uh from
neville you know so i just assume it's
[SPEAKER_01]: some nl skunk type i've heard rumors of it
being skunk and then nl skunk so um it's
[SPEAKER_01]: looking like it's got some nl in there so
you know nl skunk by the puck should i got
[SPEAKER_00]: my fingers crossed that should be really
good hell yeah hell yeah i'm keen for that
[SPEAKER_00]: one uh another question i had had a lot of
people interested in was i think we might
[SPEAKER_00]: have touched on it briefly in the past but
just to cover it again because people seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to be very interested do you have much of
a backstory on the nepalese hash plant you
[SPEAKER_00]: use in the puck crosses i think people see
the photos of that and they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: blown away and they're like wow what is
this nepalese hash plant man that thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: really really unique um kevin george
sourced it out of uh grass valley and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know brought it over to humble you
know with wonderland nursery and shared it
[SPEAKER_01]: out to a bunch of people and um it's just
amazing old school stock you know and when
[SPEAKER_01]: you cross it to something like the puck
you get you know throwbacks that are old
[SPEAKER_01]: school shit that you're not really going
to see anywhere that breeding just clicked
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the puck crosses uh produced
really huge buds but the way those uh
[SPEAKER_01]: nepalese were just covered in calyxes and
uh just like next level so that one's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely going to meet the bx2 yeah wow
and just to clarify i think i already know
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer but again a lot of fans are
interested it's not the uh the nepalese
[SPEAKER_00]: variety that uh bode used in gogog is it
no there is a rumor recently going around
[SPEAKER_01]: that uh you know people not bode but
people other people just assuming it was
[SPEAKER_01]: and um i showed bode samples of it like
five years ago now when i first got the
[SPEAKER_01]: cut and he was like wow that's an amazing
bud but that's not the nepalese that he
[SPEAKER_00]: used yeah i think like when i spoke to him
at his house one day i think he said that
[SPEAKER_00]: he suspected what he used was like
misnamed there was actually like an og or
[SPEAKER_00]: something but it just got called that but
there you go now we know well yeah it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not the same cut you know who knows what
he used so interesting stuff nonetheless
[SPEAKER_00]: so uh just to our final question or two
before i let you get back to it a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: fans very keen to hear probably mr james
bean also very keen to hear any chance
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll ever see any feminized work coming
out of crickets and cicada only if one of
[SPEAKER_01]: my really close old school friends wants
to do the work you know there has been
[SPEAKER_01]: talk amongst a few of them that they would
do the work you know obviously people
[SPEAKER_01]: would love to see the red lebanese and
cuts like that feminized and released in
[SPEAKER_01]: their pure form and um if i had somebody
really you know old school trustworthy
[SPEAKER_01]: friend that you know needed uh something
to do that might happen but it's never
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be what i'm going to be doing i'm
going to be focused on getting them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pure c-form um regulars you know i think
uh you know if the people want it or not
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just where my heart is and you know
that's where uh i feel good about what i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and especially since i'm trying to
get these old clones in the seed form as
[SPEAKER_01]: you know close as possible um choosing the
males to the original clone try to
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve the qualities as much as possible
i feel like that's where i should be going
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know with the people's interest in
the puck that only reinforces that so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's you know where i'm going to be
going yeah 100 that's that's awesome to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear i i wish i lived closer so that i
could do that fem project for you but even
[SPEAKER_00]: if it doesn't happen we're uh we're
incredibly blessed to have access to your
[SPEAKER_00]: work in general i think that's just about
everything i wanted to ask for our little
[SPEAKER_00]: segment here were there any comments or
shout outs you wanted to make you know
[SPEAKER_01]: hannibal is i could never be doing this
without her she's uh you know a rock and
[SPEAKER_01]: um i just want to thank her she doesn't
like getting on and doing these interviews
[SPEAKER_01]: but uh it's much much appreciated from her
too made her really happy so thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys yeah 100 as as someone who's seen the
uh the inner workings of crickets and
[SPEAKER_00]: cicada i can definitely vouch that
hannibal does a lot of work has the eye
[SPEAKER_00]: helps out so i always try to make sure we
give props to her as well she's
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental in it all and i also just
wanted to give you guys another shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: props for the award you know a killer year
so far not just the puck back cross even
[SPEAKER_00]: the brood x which it's crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: because i guess it's sort of maybe for
some people feels like it got a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time coming well you know i couldn't
be more shocked and more happy and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: greatly appreciated and thank you very
much
[SPEAKER_00]: all righty i think that just about brings
us to the end of it for the past 15 16
[SPEAKER_00]: months any comments any notable shout outs
you want to give for people who maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't make the list but uh near and dear
to your heart and let me save you the
[SPEAKER_00]: effort i know everyone you stock is
phenomenal they're all your children
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a loving papa you've got you got a
shout out for all of them that's the thing
[SPEAKER_02]: so i so if if i do one i gotta sit here
and go through the list i mean like i
[SPEAKER_02]: represent all these guys because because
if i don't i'll feel bad so um it really
[SPEAKER_02]: is because it also comes down to if
they're all individual they're all unique
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the fun thing about seeds if they
were all doing the same thing i wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: need 60 of them i wouldn't want 60 of them
like still a couple of them right because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like sometimes when we deal with them
i have to tell people who deal with you
[SPEAKER_02]: know we deal with stoners on the phone
right i deal with super stoners when i
[SPEAKER_02]: talk with breeders those are guys who are
trying to get higher and so uh sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you get the uh the bumps in the
road that come with dealing with super
[SPEAKER_02]: stoners but um but they're all but they
all do different things and so you know
[SPEAKER_02]: when i pick up a breeder i pick him up for
a reason and for what he's doing what he's
[SPEAKER_02]: working with and so for me to pick one
over the others it depends what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for right each breeder is going to
do something different for you um if you
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're growing uh you know high frosty
thc stuff i might tell you get a pack of
[SPEAKER_02]: snow high go with some land rage go with
some crazy off the wall stuff that you
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't grown before um that you might see
different things you'll see some original
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics of what they used to be
before they were so heavily worked you
[SPEAKER_02]: know if you're if you're big into you know
exotic genetics i might tell you go go try
[SPEAKER_02]: a pack of 420 fast you know fast buds try
some monoflowers why why not you got two
[SPEAKER_02]: pots in the plant try them and say
everybody's talk shit about them well
[SPEAKER_02]: other plants have evolved check out how
monoflowers have evolved give them a shot
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't cost you anything one plant
gives you keeps you excited to go out to
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow i know when i was growing my my
whole room was the same thing i kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: bored because i saw the same thing that i
had grown for the fifth time and so if i
[SPEAKER_02]: kept like one or two plants at the front
there might see different things and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: you motivated to go out to the garage and
you definitely want to keep your your 90
[SPEAKER_02]: percent of your canopy paying the bills
but the other five to ten percent you can
[SPEAKER_02]: play you know scout and look at and grow
something that's exciting so should i say
[SPEAKER_02]: uh i got i got lots of stuff that over 60
breeders on the website check them all out
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all great shout out to all of them
uh definitely big shout out to uh you know
[SPEAKER_02]: second place compound they carry those
guys and definitely big shout out to
[SPEAKER_02]: crickets and skittles once again you know
not a new guy not a flash in the pan not
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who's been here in the last five
years this guy's been put in the work has
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics to show it and uh i you know
if i try to pick out one of the strains i
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't want you to put me on one because
they're all they're all just phenomenal
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's there's not it depends what
you're looking for so really good stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: thanks for having me on again i appreciate
it everybody uh of course i'm james bean
[SPEAKER_02]: seats here now dot com and seats here now
s h and auctions which if you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: an auction site give myself a plug we
auction off stuff from my vault over the
[SPEAKER_02]: past 12 years i've been working with
breeders and i always keep two of every
[SPEAKER_02]: pack uh we keep uh say i get 10 packs in i
keep two of them as my own as my own stock
[SPEAKER_02]: i buy those two put those in the vault
that way if there's any situation down the
[SPEAKER_02]: road and i have to replace a pack i've got
that pack and i can fix it for you make it
[SPEAKER_02]: right well over the years those packs that
never had any situations with them ended
[SPEAKER_02]: up staying in the vault so they're kind of
trying to packs and those packs i'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: growing i because i run a c bank i can't
grow i shouldn't grow in my garage like i
[SPEAKER_02]: used to so uh those we auction those packs
off and uh there's all kinds of good stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: in there it's everything i've had over the
past 12 years that's coming up so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of it's kind of cool just to look at
it as a library of the packs that used to
[SPEAKER_02]: be right and they're my packs and so
they've been in a bank storage vault like
[SPEAKER_02]: in an actual bank that has an actual
security guard uh but all kinds of fun
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in a portion of all those uh
auctions go to uh the breeder relief fund
[SPEAKER_02]: which we've you know had in the past we
raised have helped your community help
[SPEAKER_02]: raise money in the past now we have the
breeder relief fund so if something
[SPEAKER_02]: happens we've got some money to help
somebody sometimes so a little shameless
[SPEAKER_02]: plug across the website ctr now.com
breeders satisfaction guarantee if you
[SPEAKER_02]: ever have a situation with my product let
me know i'll make it right with you tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you send me seeds tell me to stop uh yeah
that's all i got thanks once again i
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate appreciate the podcast you know
a lot a lot of history every time every
[SPEAKER_02]: time we lose a facebook page or an
instagram page you know we lose that page
[SPEAKER_02]: but we also lose that history we also lose
those photographs that that proof that
[SPEAKER_02]: those things happened and as we lose and
we get censored by youtubes and they take
[SPEAKER_02]: down our videos for violating censorship
here and there we lose those stories that
[SPEAKER_02]: happened and so we need shows like this
that keep that shit straight so when we go
[SPEAKER_02]: back and look at what happened who did
what we have those available to us and say
[SPEAKER_02]: this you know yes now you can go down the
corner store and buy that pack of joints
[SPEAKER_02]: but it wasn't always like that and this is
how we got here so i appreciate you doing
[SPEAKER_02]: the podcast and keeping it up for
everybody and i'm sure it's labor of love
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got to be a thing to do every you
know i gotta go do another one but we do
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate it and keeping the history
spread likewise we appreciate having you
[SPEAKER_00]: as a sponsor and you know it's a labor of
love but there you go friends so to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick rundown again of the winners for
this year congratulations to everyone we
[SPEAKER_00]: have the breeder of the year crickets and
