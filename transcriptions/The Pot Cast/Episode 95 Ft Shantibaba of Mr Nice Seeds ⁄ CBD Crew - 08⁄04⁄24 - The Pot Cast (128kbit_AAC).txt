not be consciously aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: From VPD to PPF, dew point, temperature,
humidity, so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to get yourself a Pulse sensor
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has revolutionized the way I grow
flower and increased the terpene content,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabinoid content, the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out as always to our friends at
Pulse sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Likewise, if any of you guys have been
listening to the show, you know that I am

to vaporized options if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: considerate about their spiritual health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, Dynavap are the world leaders
in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynavap helped me to transition from bongs
to vaping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell you what, I've never looked back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their unit is the most potent,
the most highly replicating of a bong hit
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through their incredible M unit,
I was able to successfully get off bongs a
[SPEAKER_02]: few years ago now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Truly one of the most innovative and
interesting vapes on the market using a
[SPEAKER_02]: totally different design to others you

[SPEAKER_02]: as well as an absolute kick-ass Aussie
breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: A massive welcome to none other
Shantybaba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here to chat all things genetics,
history, medical cannabis and predictions
[SPEAKER_02]: for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Preservation and so, so, so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further delay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, gang, we're back for another
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on this one today, we're welcoming
back an absolute titan of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: scene, one of the last remaining
godfathers of modern genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know him, you love him.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big shout out and thank you to
Shantybaba of Mr. Nice Seed Bank for
[SPEAKER_02]: taking the time to join us again today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't realize you'd be back so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's lovely to be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much appreciated that you took the time to
come join us again today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same question we started off with last
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, today it's a bit early because
it's only morning time my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could get up in the middle of the
night and had a puff on, I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: pink lemonade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a variety that we've been growing
for some years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a good, good, good feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too strong, not too weak,
lovely flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a good effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to bed and have a few hours extra
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can envision myself doing a similar
thing, that little nightcap to help get
[SPEAKER_02]: you back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to just follow that up and ask,
are there any particular things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: like daily drives for you that like,
you know, you're sort of regularly
[SPEAKER_02]: reaching for?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the things in your toolkit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was thinking about that the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have the kind of,
I mean, I wake up and I feel different
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to have a big variety from
different hashes that I've made,
[SPEAKER_00]: even Moroccan and Charis sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three or four different marijuana
are always available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can choose because some morning I
wake up and I just want to numb myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another morning I wake up and I'm bubbly
and I just take one or two puffs of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a mega haze joint and I'm fine
for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, I suppose it's to do with
the chemistry going on in your body and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you slept and things like what's on
your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like to keep solids and
greenery available, two or three of each
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mix up stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not one of these purists when it comes
to, you know, sort of, I suppose I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: purist in the fact of I try everything a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I choose to just do it myself,
just recreational smoke or then it
[SPEAKER_00]: changes, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lately, I suppose I've been towards
the solids, the hashes that we make,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, ourselves out of single strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're always very interesting when
you try a single strain of hash like
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we talked about this last time a
little bit about making some different
[SPEAKER_00]: blends and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's really different when you
try the hash version of that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a few more different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of listeners who were really
thrilled with the sort of discussion you
[SPEAKER_02]: gave last episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a little follow up, I'd be curious to
ask, do you find that there are any
[SPEAKER_02]: particular sativa strains that translate
in effect nicely into the concentrates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think you often hear people
saying, oh, a lot of the times it just
[SPEAKER_02]: feels sort of like hybrid slash indecree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You lose that uplifting, euphoric sort of
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any strains that come to mind
for you where like you think it does
[SPEAKER_02]: translate over nicely?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've made hashes from obviously I
think Afghan haze is a really good,
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible strain, first of all,
as a marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the building blocks of the industry
from our breeding point, both Neville and
[SPEAKER_00]: I over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually if you grow it well and
you grow enough of it, you can make some
[SPEAKER_00]: really good hash from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't make 10 to 12 percent like
on a dry you know, sort of a yield from
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you do it ice or dry or whichever
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could definitely get, you know,
sort of seven, eight percent out of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these haze hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet I always try to describe them a little
bit more like the effervescent part of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the champagnes in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of you don't always feel stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're cerebrally high, you know,
and so I kind of like that when you go out
[SPEAKER_00]: to a party uplifted and you're a bit
euphoric and kind of can hear music really
[SPEAKER_00]: well and you, you know, rather than your
body's tired and you want to sort of slap
[SPEAKER_00]: on the couch and watch a film.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I suppose Neville's haze we made,
we were lucky enough to grow quite a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of it at one stage outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said to you, I mean,
I like outdoor plants for making hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they actually the resonance is
much more rounded and a bit like wine or
[SPEAKER_00]: olives, you know, something to do with the
environment and that year and the sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect in the water and all of the
chemicals in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the terpens, I always find the
terpens are much stronger and they last
[SPEAKER_00]: longer from outdoor variety rather than
indoor because indoor you open it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a flush of, of, of turpentine and
then it sort of dies down very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a good grown outdoor, you open up
the jar and the room remains fragrant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it stays there like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll probably find out a few years
that outdoor has a better integrity of on
[SPEAKER_00]: the turpentine and the flavonoids and
different compounds on the plant rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than indoor and greenhouse sort of,
you know, controlling the climate and then
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you the potentially the best yields
of cannabinoids and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the combination of both is
always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I blend, you know, it's like
what I explained last time, blending a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dry with the ice and kind of making
the flavours, the full integrity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, and, you know, many times I've,
I've the hash, like what I was explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: before, when you do a single strain and
you make a sieve from it, a dry sieve from
[SPEAKER_00]: it, for example, there's something
different about the hash version than the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant version, because you probably got
some very small amounts of a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid that you have a minute amount
in a plant, but you never really get the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a hash, you've got a higher
concentration of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it fits into the recipe of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I always say the hash
version of a single strain field is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: it allows you to understand exactly the
medicine of that plant properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the plant maybe has a completely
different feeling sometimes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll changes that effect as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I do think they're really
important to study them as two different
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of medicines in a way, you know,
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess with what you've just said as
a follow up, do you specifically breed
[SPEAKER_02]: with the intention of plants performing
well outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that where you sort of see the
global production of cannabis heading in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, outdoors is obviously the
cheapest and if you have a good season,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the most abundant, cheapest yielding
kind of property you can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, everything has to be climate
controlled and there's an expense and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's staff and a lot of electricity and
a lot of expenses related to an
[SPEAKER_00]: established greenhouse or an indoor
facility, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor, you don't always hit it on the
head with the environment for that year
[SPEAKER_00]: and the climate maybe affects it in a
negative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it hits it in a positive way,
I do believe you've got a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: yield compared to what you could produce
inside or in a greenhouse, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot more scope with
cheaper production lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, making hash outdoor for me would
be a very sensible way, sensible kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: decision and using aspects of indoor
greenhouse to blend with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be that would come into it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like Australia doesn't really have,
hasn't had a hash culture, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, only pockets of it where people
making their own extracts now in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the extreme boys have been
making a little bit of sieve, but you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have to know them to actually experience
that in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas Europe had 80% of their market had
always been solids, you know, for up until
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When marijuana started to kind of come in
and become interesting and different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they see them as different things
rather than just marijuana or wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's been an evolution and it
still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still evolving because not everybody
knows everything about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: strains or what do they do to people or
how the effect is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sometimes year to year,
they vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor and they don't have the same
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell the same and there's something
missing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suppose, excuse me, I suppose it's
the same with wine and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like this year, unfortunately,
a lot of people in Liguria in Italy,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't pick the olives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, they got hit during the season
with some hails and we've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage and it was just not economic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a few areas that it
wasn't practical and it wasn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no value in picking the olives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year will be a particularly
average year, you know, for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens outside because you can't
control obviously the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, with that point in mind,
I guess, do you think that the base sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of commodity of medical cannabis in the
future might be some sort of high ly
[SPEAKER_02]: processed product as opposed to flower
because of that inherent variation from
[SPEAKER_02]: season to season you referenced?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, will there eventually be
like a Jack Daniel's number seven
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent of concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've tossed, we talked about
this many times when we were riding high,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose, Howard and Neville and myself
and a few other guys, we always talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about having the connoisseurs club,
you know, where we've kept different years
[SPEAKER_00]: of hash and we've vacuum sealed them and
kept them in a cellar like we do wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we had a bud, but the buds
fade because they yellow out and the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll deteriorates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make an extraction,
they don't fade so quickly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some of the cannabinoids change to
more sleepier cannabinoids over time and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hold them well, and I've got a
friend who's made, he's got a sample of
[SPEAKER_00]: every single piece of hash he came across
or made from the early 90s onwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a coffee, it could be a
coffee table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was really, this is really
impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really see the difference and the
evolution you see, and we've become very
[SPEAKER_00]: good at making hashes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, early days, when we were
really tossing around, we made a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in 1998, 99 in Switzerland when I
first came here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to gather what fell off the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to just cut the flowers off the
wood over the silk screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end of the day, I would just go
there myself and get it all because they
[SPEAKER_00]: were different plants done a different
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to gather, say, skunk one
only hash or super silver hash or early
[SPEAKER_00]: coin hash or you know, and we kept it and
we were able to press it up and clean it
[SPEAKER_00]: up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use that as the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to melt it with olive oil and give
that as drops to patients right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that was the bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always used that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ice, then we started with the
water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was actually real base of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I believe that at the moment,
unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_00]: is so overregulated and corrupt that I
think that the only way that people will
[SPEAKER_00]: take it back eventually, the hash makers
or the like the wine makers, they will be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing little small areas of particular
sort of strains that only grow in those
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, for example, really well,
and they'll be making a kind of 200 kilos
[SPEAKER_00]: of cottage industry style stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that maybe is bought by a particular
pharmaceutical who uses it to make their
[SPEAKER_00]: base product is one of the base products
that they blend, you know, and those
[SPEAKER_00]: specific sort of kind of unique recipes
will start with like companies that will
[SPEAKER_00]: only demand high quality and have found a
plant that's actually working for a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular ailment, you know, and they see
that it's useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll start to specialize down those
lines even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start getting pockets of people who
have worked on particular plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain ailments, you know, and or maybe
the turpentine, the cannabinoid blend of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a particular mastic bush,
for example, does something really well
[SPEAKER_00]: for depressive people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you make the extraction,
that particular stuff works every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so obviously, then we can
start to say, this is much better for that
problem.
You know, at the moment, it's a bit of
stab in the dark, I'm afraid, even the
best doctors and the best growers,
they can't really predict, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what what is happening or they can't prove
it with science why that plant is better
[SPEAKER_00]: for you if you're suffering from
Parkinson's or or food disorder or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I mean, it's very difficult
where that that level at the moment of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to work it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of scientific research is
going into very small incremental facets
[SPEAKER_00]: of this industry at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think like long term,
I'm talking many years, eventually we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: get to the point where you'll have a
certain cannabis, you know, product
[SPEAKER_02]: extract, whatever form it is, that's for
X, Y, Z, and it slots in with all your
[SPEAKER_02]: other pharma tablets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a quick follow up, how do you think
we can help get the acceptance we need
[SPEAKER_02]: from health care workers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that around the world,
there's still a lot of people in health
[SPEAKER_02]: care who are still very dismissive and not
particularly interested in medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a difficult one,
because changing the mentality,
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw how slowly the world changed from
marijuana being a drug because of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative propaganda for many, many,
many decades to it becoming a medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: being treated with a lot more respect
still has a stigma attached in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still old people who don't,
you know, would put a pill in their mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: any day of fentanyl, but they they would
question, you know, someone smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer is using drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so mindset is a really important
education is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and actually, allowing people to
decide with a better consultation from
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe an agency or independent agency that
is not profiting from giving out any
[SPEAKER_00]: particular advice, but helping the patient
before they see the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a kind of understanding of
what they're looking for when they
[SPEAKER_00]: describe their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors aren't always the people who
prescribe the best drugs for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes they're earning they
have sponsorship from certain companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that kind of,
you know, sort of tins the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would prefer to see a much more
neutral committee set up to help people
[SPEAKER_00]: get knowledge about what things do to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and how they could be
looking for the best particular things
[SPEAKER_00]: that some people need a pill, they don't
smoke because they've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: particular sickness, and smoking is
revolting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally believe no sick person wants
to smoke, inhale anything, I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: would prefer to take a pill, a capsule or
a slug of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I believe that's the real
medical that's the real medical fraternity
[SPEAKER_00]: that I look at when I'm looking at those
and not say that the people who have have
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of jumped on the bandwagon as
medical, but they're using it as
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there should be a discre,
a difference to the truth between medical
[SPEAKER_00]: and recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people should be allowed to use
most everything, as long as they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that you, you've got to put
it in an independent sort of committee
[SPEAKER_00]: that sets some rules that are not tainted
by big companies and by individual
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want them to sort of
push certain things, but you need
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficult question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm sorry to put it to you,
my friend, but I knew you were up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm looking at it all the time at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I mean, I'm working in the
medical people now where I work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical because we have the licenses and
it makes the legal side of it much better
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have farms that we can go to and hold
our head up high and we can work with
[SPEAKER_00]: certain strains now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I believe a lot of the people who
I'm working with in Switzerland don't come
[SPEAKER_00]: from my industry whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from a very educated sort of
protocol of a pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_00]: where they realize that some things have
been pushed on public, not really helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've actually changed their way and
they want to get a natural, something
[SPEAKER_00]: natural that they see the next level of
understanding for a lot of people and the
[SPEAKER_00]: least harmful and least symptomatic,
post symptomatic problems that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: with taking certain drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's half the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't like to take a pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have to be desperate to take a
pill of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I know that I've made this
capsule with just 6% CBD and 40 terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on for an extra better carafenol
terpenes to enhance the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know those things work for me at the
moment, but it's just trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is going to take a while to
be very confident to know, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is my opinion or this is science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment it's my opinion based on a
little bit of home science, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I mean, we had our intuitions about
the medical values early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure as time goes by and we discover
more, we'll learn more that probably backs
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of the things we suspected.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to quickly change the topic
because that was the reason why I asked
[SPEAKER_02]: you some of the hard medical questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew you were into it, but I wanted to
ask the day after we did our last chat,
[SPEAKER_02]: you put a post up talking about how you
have a new skunk line coming out and
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately it's called New Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
backstory on this one and what inspired
[SPEAKER_02]: you to do this project now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been busting open a lot of old
seed from my fridges and a lot of old
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff from Nell's and some of it has been
germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit too old and some of it we're
doing different techniques to get some old
[SPEAKER_00]: seed germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually was, the new skunk was
actually a very old skunk seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a skunk one by skunk 187.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of Neville's very old thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read the thing and I got the male
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hit it back to my skunk one,
which is the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I produced a very small batch of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it tested by quite a lot of people
on the website and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was trying to develop a good hash
making skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that was the kind of project in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was different smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was definitely that old stink that
really it was not pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was a little bit off putting,
waft over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember a lot of people used to
love the effect of those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I must have mentioned at one time that
I was doing this on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got a line of people and
they all started hassling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I send out a batch of these old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave them to my daughter to put
through the options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of made test batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've made a small batch, but I'm
still playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, selecting is a really wide variety
in that selection of the progeny seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: I call new skunk at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer to inbreed some of it back
to the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep selecting a female and
putting it back to the male until I really
[SPEAKER_00]: see a particular thing coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few people have asked me for the
stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to go back and they're trying
to find that old world skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe you can find it,
but you're going to have to bust open a
[SPEAKER_00]: few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm making some more seed at the
moment just for a few guys who want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: like a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to look for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I don't say that you'll find
it every time, but I'm trying to give the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools back to some people who were looking
specifically for certain things again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've definitely got the original and
all of Neville and all of my old stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the old stuff that we started all
this change from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upstairs in the office, I have six or
seven fridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I could float a few
countries with crops, but they're all at
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't have enough time,
I kind of put the notes inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum seal it and put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going to come to it in a few
years because there's only so many seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: you can bust open and so many projects you
can do properly and give you attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: it at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a can of Bible, I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I have to really go back to
that to realize what that particular batch
[SPEAKER_00]: of seed was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that it had an orange corner on
it for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would find the orange corner
and then I'd go, oh, yeah, that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look through that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I help a lot of guys at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sent a few batches of garlic bud to
one guy in England and some old hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find something, you'd share it
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, these are old seeds from
30, 40 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to have enough time in my
life to bust open everything that I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: treasured away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that sort of time for certain
people to trust them, to kind of help with
[SPEAKER_00]: some projects, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a really good batch of people
on the forum and my moderator,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an excellent guy and he's a very good
grower, excellent photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is that he's educated
now for these new up and coming guys who
[SPEAKER_00]: are really playing with their own
varieties and adding some hazers in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, he's already done all
these things and he comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical world, which disgruntled
the pharmaceutical world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's retired now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's the perfect guy to, he's an
educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an educated, smart, wonderful,
diplomatic person to have better than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I'm a bit short sometimes when I
think people have asked the question 7,000
[SPEAKER_00]: times and they should have read some of
the literature, but he's not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I really thank some of the crew
around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been exceptionally helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter, my son, my sons, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, many hands make light work and
so many cool little tivets there we could
[SPEAKER_02]: chase down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess one of the things that stuck out
to me, I'd love to hear you said your
[SPEAKER_02]: female skunk cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that one like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not actually mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the original skunk one that
Neville had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Watson and Rob Clark, they were all
playing at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville found his particular and he called
his skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Watson called his version skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to remember skunk one was a
skunk is a very confused term because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's arguments if there was certain
things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and of course, you know, Dave,
Dave Watson has his version and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is probably correct according
to him there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, Neville probably
selected they were working similarly at
[SPEAKER_00]: one stage when everyone was friendly until
this Green Merchants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of problem that came in and exposed a
few of the Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, things changed and
that was all in Holland at that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all started to then separate
their plants, you know, and Neville was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was, he was the real go-getter
and innovator of specific genetics at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, whereas the other guys were there
for reasons I don't know and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses for reasons I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was friends with all of them and I
was using both sides and there were slight
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in this skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did like Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a version of Rob Clark gave me
once and I made some incredible hash from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they're all that it's like,
if I pick a haze or Neville picked a haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd pick different hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were differences that we liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it would be the same with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put a hundred haze in the room
and there might be a hundred different
[SPEAKER_00]: versions and they're all called haze,
you know, so I think keeping the original
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in, in as, as much as I can and living
genetics has been probably the hardest job
[SPEAKER_00]: of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and always having four or five
backups in different countries because you
[SPEAKER_00]: lose so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and now thank God for
tissue culture, which is, is, is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: save us, get rid of some of the viruses
that are now, you know, the latent hop
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mosaic virus and there's other
viruses coming and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really need to be aware of,
of a lot more things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll say busting it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't many viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really worried about the old
seed coming in, but a lot of these new
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, I'm just, I don't take it in my
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take any plants from, from
anything that hasn't come from tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, regrow and, and plenty,
you know, because this, this, this virus
[SPEAKER_00]: goes around pretty quickly now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it used to be just talked about in
America and a little bit in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's around the world now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's one of these things
that maybe doesn't express itself until
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions go down, but it's
definitely, it's spread now, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of those things you should go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm going to have to loop back to
several of the points there, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: the hop latent virus and, you know,
the just maintaining mothers over years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely some interesting topics,
but I wanted to quickly ask you before we
[SPEAKER_02]: move on, you mentioned Dave Watson and I
think in the grand scheme of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's considered one of the grandfathers of
the whole industry in a sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a long time, he copped a lot of
flack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people would accuse him of
collaborating with that green merchant
[SPEAKER_02]: operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for the most part,
people have realized that that wasn't the
[SPEAKER_02]: case and he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be interested to hear what's your sort
of thoughts on the overall roles Dave
[SPEAKER_02]: Watson slash Sam the skunk man has played
in the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any notable stories or encounters?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't make an opinion about
things that I weren't around for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm only hearing from particular
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with Ariane and Neville at
that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was very much against Dave Watson
and Rob and the other crew at that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was friendly with them both and they had
different dealings with everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not a guy to make my opinion unless
I was asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was definitely more purist about
breeding at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a little bit more focused on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were both excellent sources from
different things and as well as other guys
[SPEAKER_00]: in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I was meant to be probably on
Neville and the greenhouse side at that
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, I kept an open mind and I did
business with both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did prefer the diversity of seed
breeding from Neville because say Dave,
[SPEAKER_00]: he wasn't he was his wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him many times and we have a healthy
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We respect each other like Rob Clark is
probably a better friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen him all over the world and we
were good mates and still are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just haven't been in Holland and
seen them for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have any negative feelings
about all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't around for that Green Merchant
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard about it was exposed on the radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I was working with Neville and
Ariane in a big greenhouse where we did a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and they had on Dutch radio,
they had a big explanation about that
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some merit to certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what was provable or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Dutch wasn't so good then and it didn't
get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved to Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried to not give my opinion
about things that really I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say proof is in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I took the seed from what they
said and where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I busted it open and I went through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't have to believe anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believed me from what I was given.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it was a little bit of a
goose chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other times there was some gems in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guys that I respected,
I worked with and the other guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there was a there's been a
lot of negative press about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read stories that never even happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so I mean, I don't know
what's to believe anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know what I did and I know
what I have and I know who I did it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me questions about those
things all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have a beer with all of them
still to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really that opinionated about
those things because it really doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anything to do with the subject that
I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually that's to do with breeding or
selecting or finding cannabinoid specific
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and and for me,
I still use Rob Clark's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used a lot of my black hashes and
Indian hashes for his hashish book,
[SPEAKER_00]: photographed many times in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've we've we've collaborated in
things that most people would never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day, I suppose, I'll do some other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess we'll have to wait for that
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You read my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, you know, I was hooked
on the story about the hash you made that
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob gave you the seeds from last time we
were chatting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned him a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a good time to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think as well as Rob's known for
his like seminal literature, the book,
[SPEAKER_02]: I also feel like he's kind of a little bit
of an unsung hero of the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he sort of flies a bit under the
radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your friendship with Rob been like
over the years?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you agree he's a bit of an unsung
hero?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for me, Rob, I still recommend his
original book, Marijuana Botany,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the first book that most people should
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's the only one of the I believe
he is a scientific author.
[SPEAKER_00]: He he runs around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: To all the places, not the cannabis cups,
but to the places where genetics originate
[SPEAKER_00]: from, where thread and fibre is originated
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gone deep into that kind of side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gone to the Russian areas and Ukraine
areas and found strains and helped keep
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve a lot of hemp varieties,
you know, in seed form up in the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's done a lot of unsung hero kind of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, he's still a very reliable
source of incredible intelligence when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to a practical education and a
theoretical education of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I don't really read a lot of
the other guys books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm friendly with them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I don't think that they I
think they're writing it from a different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, whereas Rob has always read
it from a scientific point of view with
[SPEAKER_00]: provable referenced articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I like his books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as that goes, yes,
I think he's probably the best cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: writer around, you know, in in a when it
comes to not having your ego or opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in what you're writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a what a testament.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly regarded by all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But awesome to hear that you have him in
such high esteems.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little earlier, you mentioned that
there's issues of over the years,
[SPEAKER_02]: like parents changing and stuff of strains
that are offered by certain companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I'm interested in this from
the point of view that I know like one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the notable cases was like Simon of
serious seeds mentioned that at a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: point, the parents of Cali miss change
because one of the parents got lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's started getting me thinking,
like, what are some of the challenges in
[SPEAKER_02]: general of maintaining a library of stock
over such a long period of time?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be things that the average
person isn't even thinking about when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're comparing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you ever had any issues with like
mixed up stock or parents accidentally
[SPEAKER_02]: being lost, things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single issue in the book I've had,
I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, in the old days,
when you found something like Medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, like, you know, whatever it was,
when you found that genetic and you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually had that genetic, you would have
to cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't want to share it because that
was your new baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been working on it for a while,
your new baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you put it in rooms of people who were
growing stuff for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a backup, right, in two or
three different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times you got busted and you lost the
mother room or someone followed you home
[SPEAKER_00]: and they ripped you off or every story in
the book has happened, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've lost, I've told you last time,
I had in four, five countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost in four countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my backups only had one left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in jail at that time when I came
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was an incredible relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know the same thing happened to
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the same thing's happened to every
Simon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recently had to redo all of his mothers
because he got the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak to him quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: He buys pills for his father from my
company in Czech Republic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all, I'm pretty friendly with
most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all, we talk openly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we do all have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, the hardest part of the job has
been, like I said, keeping mothers
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, mothers safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the original genetic label properly in
all different countries when you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt that we've lost plants
during our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes A-Mail, Neville had lost,
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: G13, original, died.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost various plants, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also went through Hawaii Five-O.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost at one stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy Judy, Fruity Nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost, I have it in seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of these in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often go back, but the original genetic
that I selected, which I made certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things from, we lost, but we have the same
gene, genome generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can always find the genotype,
but to find the turpentine and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other small differences that made that
plant special, you know, luckily,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, genetics is based on genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can recreate things similarly,
but maybe not exactly, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know Simon's got different,
like me, he's got different generations in
[SPEAKER_00]: cold storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you have to go back and
you've got to bust open something and find
[SPEAKER_00]: another father or mother, or nowadays it's
just mainly selections, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can spray them and self them and
do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still don't like to use feminized
order flowering in the breeding world,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I still think true male and female
expresses something different,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's just my personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of guys proving me
wrong, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still purist when it comes to going
back to finding the original parents of a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular strain, like Afghan and Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the Afghan T, that made that
up originally from Neve, he selected that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then crossed it with the Hayes C,
you know, and the Hayes A, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: got two different versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had to start with selection
and that took quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the first one that pops out
is the right one, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then you keep that alive and,
you know, and that's established building
[SPEAKER_00]: block over 30, well older than my kids,
so still the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the longevity of its lifespan is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned the Hayes A dropping off
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You piqued my ears because I'd heard
rumors, and I'll be honest, I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: doubted it, but I figured I'll ask you why
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard anything about the Hayes C
male still being alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm the only guy with Hayes C
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Neville gave it to me a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a few Hayes and a few other things
many years ago, plus all of you seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How have I been making the seeds for the
last 30 years in the midst of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's still, if you have a look,
I have now selected a Hayes A C male,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something from old seed that I
took two years to bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, most everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the Hayes A any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have it in living form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have it in seed form mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, like in the mango Hayes,
the difference between mango Hayes and
[SPEAKER_00]: super silver Hayes is the Hayes A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Skunk Hayes A with Northern
Light Hayes C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two were the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, they were the selection and
they were the parents who made the mango
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes, whereas the Hayes C Skunk,
the Skunk A C and Northern Light Hayes C
[SPEAKER_00]: that made the super silver Hayes line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when they were parallel,
we call the parallel cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all coming into eventually
pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it on a map, you'd finally come
to a pedigree line.
[SPEAKER_00]: When everything had won their cuffs,
Neville used to start like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he won something, he used that as a
pedigree plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we only did pedigree breeding at
one stage and with the widows and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, we kept that going in certain
charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, there's a lot of and
there's a lot of things that people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really understand as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you sometimes when you
select an old seed, say Northern Light 1
[SPEAKER_00]: and Northern Light 2 and Northern Light 5,
I've got an old seed of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will select a female and a male from
that thing that have been working
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you cross it back, you can use a
male version or a female version.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be very slightly different,
giving different things, but they're from
[SPEAKER_00]: the same genotype and that way you're
keeping the genes consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the expression maybe is different in
the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoked to hear you've still got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you mentioned the super
silver Hayes and the mango Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd been thinking about that in the
last episode, you made a comment that
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville had gone through like thousands of
seeds to find the super silver Hayes and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd managed to do it with just 250.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I was wondering, do you
attribute that sort of more to luck or do
[SPEAKER_02]: you think just the way you had bred the
line differently to the way he had bred
[SPEAKER_02]: his allowed you to be like a bit more
focused and you didn't need to pop as many
[SPEAKER_02]: because a bit more of the selection was
done in the breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a really hard thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe I should have done a
thousand like Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think I found something
that I could really work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when I crossed it to see,
basically what we do is we we we put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of seed and say 100 seed at a time
and you pick the best three females,
[SPEAKER_00]: best three males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do the combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You test those seeds when you can easily
test, throw away a male that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that very quickly in the progeny
test of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do that, you've got no idea
what you're selling, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies don't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have no idea what they're
selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just say that's the combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, your punters, eventually the guys who
were buying the seed, they they will
[SPEAKER_00]: expose you if you're not doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're if what you said is not
coming up trumps and I mean, to this day,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like Neville left what 20 or 23 years
ago from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't keep I can't have old seed
batches in the fridges from from old AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't sell 20 year old seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can sell two year old seed because it's
still maturing at that stage inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything's kept in fridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is vacuum sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all has dates on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old seed I offer to certain growers who
are ready to put out a big lump and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they get 80% germination rather than 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still buy it at a reduced rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of clear out stocks a lot of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know how other people
run their companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you've you've got to have
backups in genetics in seed form,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as having selected real form
mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no doubt that that's the
hardest part of the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mother room and a clone room for me and
the mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, kudos to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seems like an overwhelming task
the more I think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: After our last episode, we got a bunch of
listeners who messaged and they said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of this Dr. Gavorkian
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds so interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, everyone's really curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the the the summary of the overall
questions I got from people was,
[SPEAKER_02]: how come you think it didn't catch on
quite as well as the sister lines of mango
[SPEAKER_02]: haze and super silver haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't know that all these
things are going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so no one kept it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just made some mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a whole room of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used even the old mothers in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had got compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you the story last time with my
father.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go and chop it all up and load
it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a living genetic left of Dr.
Gavorkian.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some seed that we'd made with
that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe one day I know I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the easiest plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I smell it, it will just come straight
back in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of work to do and
there's a lot of weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of waiting and, you know,
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're big projects to try to
refine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to go into it and bust open old
seed and see what I find rather than try
[SPEAKER_00]: to control what I'm wanting to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to be more open about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes there's some really unusual
like early queen, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very different smelling unique
genetic originating from some early pearl,
[SPEAKER_00]: early girl sort of stuff that was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it still has a different
flavor, different smell and a different
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of the people the seed
is incredibly small and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a it's a real interesting kind of
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept it going because, you know,
we've made some early scum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made a lot of plants that have been
practical for growers with projects and
[SPEAKER_00]: limited seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've busted a load of seeds for those
sort of guys or made seeds specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain guys that had a six week
demand, you know, sort of flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they had to still bust open
some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they found the six week or the five
and a half week flowering one and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were in and out of their
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're probably living happily ever
after on some little island now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to do with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a lot of unusual people in
those days coming to Holland to buy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, huge volumes of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they describe what they were looking
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think I never heard of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard they got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's the successful
ones when you don't hear about anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, they're off on a Caribbean
island somewhere living it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a quick follow up, I guess I'd love to
ask, firstly, what's the most unique
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profile, like weirdest thing
you've ever smelled?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a quick follow up, those plants you
just referenced, are they the quickest
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering you've ever heard of or have you
heard of something quicker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard people say that they've found
even quicker stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's finished or whether it's
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't I think a natural cycle is
around, you know, sort of you pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: five to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you can cut things
earlier, but they're not I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly think when you think it's
ready one week extra, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of always been a rule of thumb
because a lot of a lot of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not sure about happen in these last
two or three weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some there's some stuff that
still hasn't been exposed with science
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to understand about that
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you can find out the alcohol
levels and all of the different things
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to grapes and the sugar
content and those sort of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot more of that in in sort of
in people who have knowledge about what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're breeding it for, what they're
growing it for, what the production for,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the base products for, what,
you know, there's there's a multitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: things you can do now with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think having sometimes a pure
sativa and a pure indica extract and
[SPEAKER_00]: blending them in different concentrations,
you come up with some really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what one of the questions that you
asked me was, what's the most unique one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, that's an exceptionally
difficult question to answer, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, early queen was very unusual
compared to the fruitiness of skunks and
[SPEAKER_00]: the heavy buriness of the cushions and the
body odors or the oniony kind of flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: of the widows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then maybe some mentholi alpines
of the hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have rough generalizations,
but specific plants don't fit into those
[SPEAKER_00]: rough generalizations when you start to
single them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You single them out for some reasons to do
with the olfactory system or or the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: or the one of the sensors that it hit you
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and up until like the CBD crew where
with scientists helping us select these
[SPEAKER_00]: were just all personal reasoning behind it
and personal likes and dislikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why some structures I can
identify as nevel plants from other people
[SPEAKER_00]: and others I can identify as mine because
he went for a kind of a different
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cluster that looked more like
balls that fit on top of each other where
[SPEAKER_00]: I had more individual flowers that were
not like that structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many time I see it, you know,
that they've leaned towards those sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got to face it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was selling seed before most everybody
commercially to many corners of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that, you know,
it's the Adam and Eve of seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of things evolved out of that
original stuff, you know, went to
[SPEAKER_00]: different corners, like I said,
and, you know, there's some excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: growers out there that took it on and ran
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a lot of those strains that now
pop up every so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say they created them,
but usually I think they've been created
[SPEAKER_00]: by excellent grower and hobby breeders who
have been staying very quiet and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialize their strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone did it for them and some ego took
it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and I call it the seed
circus nowadays because it's just this not
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of specific knowledge where certain
things originated from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all polyhybrid kind of things that
you started at that level and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: went on with it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's very difficult to do
that, you know, to start with something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got no idea where the original
parents, what they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know theoretically, but you
don't have them or you didn't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what their parents were, and until you
get back to a pure form, whether it was an
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan or a Thai or a Mexican or,
you know, where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I still prefer that kind of kind of
knowledge about strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I love the passion, the F1 hybrid
magic and also for keeping things pure so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, while we're on that topic,
I feel like there's a lot of variable
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology used in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, lots of words get used,
which maybe aren't necessarily the correct
[SPEAKER_02]: word for that situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And specifically, I'd be interested in
knowing your thoughts on inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the question for me is,
is it about reaching a certain number of
[SPEAKER_02]: backcrosses or filial breeding,
or is it more just about getting it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: point where it expresses fairly true and
that's like kind of independent of the
[SPEAKER_02]: number of generations?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can tell you that honestly,
when I sold a seed or Neville sold a seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what we started from,
after three, possibly four generations of
[SPEAKER_00]: someone doing it, taking that seed from us
and going over to another corner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and then choosing his male and
female and making his seed, after three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four would be for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: After four crosses and using that seed,
it is so far away from what originally
[SPEAKER_00]: sold, even though you call it the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say Northern Lights, because most
people have got a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have started with Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed NL2 to NL1 and then he selected
the NL5 from one of those combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stories and I've got a
lot of that original seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, there's male and female
versions of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people say that I mix it up many
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I use the male version and the
female version or the female version,
[SPEAKER_00]: the male version to make another line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the time to go through every
specific strain in that with every single
[SPEAKER_00]: person and explain why I do certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just generally, when you start with
things that have a name and then you do
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four versions away, they're still
the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will still call it Northern Lights,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it won't be anything to do with what
originally looked like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of those things where it does
change a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's almost like it taps into this
secondary topic where sometimes you find
[SPEAKER_02]: more novice buyers will have this
misconception that a certain strain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: F4 is inherently better than the F1 or the
F2, and you must deal with this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know how much I deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to be patient with those things
because not everybody understands exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times when you make a selection,
just again, let's say you bought a skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: one seed from us and the shit seed,
I call it, and you pick a male and a
[SPEAKER_00]: female and you pick three and three and
then you found your best female and best
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You call it number one and number one M
for male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do your work and everybody loves
what you're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes out a particular way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything is sweet, you know,
and you're known for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, someone else has taken the same
seed that bought it at you at the shop and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gone with their favorite male and
their favorite female and they've produced
[SPEAKER_00]: something that has got a lot more flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smaller bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly the same name, same genotype,
completely different phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're both calling it the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, unfortunately, the very difficult
thing to explain to everybody in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, especially newcomers,
that not everything with a generic name is
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same generational seed that they
originated from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why get so animated and argumentative
about things or so passionate about things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would never know, even if they
put it in front of you and you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: vision of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't even know because you were
not born and it was probably different to
[SPEAKER_00]: what the original version was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a selection for making a
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a selection for genetics to make
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, many times, like I had a widow
that was a better producer for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: people that wanted to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas selling the seed, you know,
you get a lot of differences coming up and
[SPEAKER_00]: some guys in Australia hitting it on the
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other guys in Canada not finding it
and thinking it's a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on the person's
knowledge and what they're looking for and
[SPEAKER_00]: if they know anything about the origins
and what they were and if they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how I describe things when I write
it down, many people have just photocopied
[SPEAKER_00]: or cut and paste and that's used forever
on every other company that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see how people are quite lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just take what's online and they
think it is the gospel truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I still think that
everything that you crack open or you
[SPEAKER_00]: select, you should do two or three times
in the grow room before you really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what you're talking about there
and what flavors are there and how well it
[SPEAKER_00]: performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's easy to write a lot of
bullshit and there's no one censoring this
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're still in a pirate industry
where we're allowed, we're not legal
[SPEAKER_00]: because making high THC strains and
growing flowers is still breaking the law
[SPEAKER_00]: of 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds inside and that's legal once
it's there, but flowers not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, still to this day,
every seed company is based on that and
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes them all illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's not a legal seed company
in the world unless they're medically
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed and licensed, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of the commercial companies,
the Dutch Fashion, the Sirius,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Greenhouse, Mr Nice, everyone,
we're all based on that principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get caught while you're producing
seed because you're over 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, we're all very grateful that you do
it for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as a quick change of topic,
you know, I've been thinking a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: recently and I talked to lots of guests
about how integral it is as like sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: new or an up and coming breed of these
days to be on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see you do a good job on social
media, but I wanted to go back a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, things like high times
and the like were kind of the social media
[SPEAKER_02]: in a sense, and they were a massive player
compared to say what they are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it like for you to have won a
cup?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, was like the mailbox exploding the
next day with orders?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what sort of an effect did these
guys have back in the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old social media were magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their relevance has died away
considerably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a lot of online magazines and,
you know, they're sort of like online
[SPEAKER_00]: newspapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're read.
[SPEAKER_00]: People still like to read about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write for this magazine, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just writing an article at the moment,
Dolce Vita.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an Italian magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been for over 105 issues
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 20 odd years I've been writing
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've written for every magazine,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I followed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day we won with White Widow,
95.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won also with Greenhouse Seed
Company as the first time we beat Sensei
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed and the first time we entered
actually as a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a post office box that was,
we didn't have email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a drop like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the post office box, it was 75018 or
something in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an incredible amount of mail
coming in every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was clearing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a celebrity odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone wanted the widow and then
they wanted the rhino and then they wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: the shark and then they wanted Super Silva
and then they wanted La Nina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a great time, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the post.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something still seriously
great about receiving physical mail with
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas cards full of money and just
asking, please, and within a return
[SPEAKER_00]: address with Joe Smith on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: People even sending coins from Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you have to educate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really think that it was all very
illegal and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But magazines made it look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason High Times went to Holland
was because it was illegal in America and
[SPEAKER_00]: the only place they could hold the cup was
in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had fantastic seats for that game
and we were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just purely because Holland was
the first place that allowed the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: refugee to feel at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to do these events there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they were huge for us in
those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're very important
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't advertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really do anything with magazines
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they lost their relevance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're still nice for people to
read sometimes when you're in a waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: room or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think there's nothing new
going on in the industry that quickly to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow so many different articles to do
with this particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think they regurgitate a lot of
the time old stuff that hasn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the changes are incremental.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the scientific changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time there's a big one,
everyone writes about it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they had their relevance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 90s was fantastic when I was with the
Greenhouse and we owe probably all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: success to the High Times magazine at that
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then towards the end, it was a very
corruptible kind of organization as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of corruptible coffee
shop owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also part of that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I particularly didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: My time had come to leave Holland around
98.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did a big thing with Neville that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I left after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold my shares and I left and went to
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did it mainly because I always
wanted to be pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought there was something much
bigger than the coffee shop kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still believe that to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've reached that point where I do
sell a lot of medical items now that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: made from my selection of my individual
plants and not in a synthetic way in a
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory how they're meant to be made
for the pharmaceutical standard and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't believe that the best people
are sitting in the right areas and making
[SPEAKER_00]: the right judgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, it's like, you know,
who is the best person for that job?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, you know, money talk,
bullshit walks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that the people who have a
lot of money somehow manage to manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit stronger than people who have
less money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the sad truth?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess if nothing else, it's awesome
to hear that you got to experience that
[SPEAKER_02]: fantasy of, you know, the mailbox
exploding with orders after that success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it used to... I'd get on my bike
down to the post office.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was near Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a big one and it was jam
packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times they knew me and they would
come with other stuff because they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't fit it in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes leave with a bag and go home
and it was fan mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people used to send embroidered
t-shirts of our logo and they'd made it
[SPEAKER_00]: home because they were so inspired by
growing that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had leather work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had jewelry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before social media, before TV,
before these mobile phone stupidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we use it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I've got to tell you that most
of the time the changes of a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: come from my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the moment, my son has been put in
charge of changing the logos and stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the shops working.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's much more better on the, let's say,
the framework of the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a younger guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's 16, 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he listens and he learns and he
educates himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've given him, put him in charge of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's doing a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my daughter, he runs the auctions and
she talks to these unusual characters
[SPEAKER_00]: daily and she seems to be so tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she's doing her own thing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm really proud of that
point of view, I suppose, that I came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the black into the white and now it's a
family business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of very sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so heartwarming to hear that it's
now a family business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to touch on the site after
this, but I want to quickly just ask
[SPEAKER_02]: first.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last answer, you mentioned how
popular the white widow was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was hoping I could get a little bit
of the backstory on that, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed the majority of the sources
online, they say you're the creator,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some of them reference this guy,
Ingmar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, how does that guy tie
into it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how did you make the seed line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingmar was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was working with us at that stage,
right at that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had selected some very good plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no doubt that he had some
excellent stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked on making the seed of selected
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Greenhouse was definitely the first
company to make the seed version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at that time, he was growing
shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can tell you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growing very similar plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shark he called Peacemaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was probably one or two other plants
that were the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sometimes were first and second
in some of these competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was growing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arian was buying flowers back from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, I suppose, when I left,
they started to make some seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very different, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never shared the mail that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the female was probably shared with
Ingmar and probably two or three other
[SPEAKER_00]: growers at that stage who were growing
commercially for the coffee shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: that version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, he wasn't a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a flower producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: His story was that when he was asked about
it, he said he found it in a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave the where it came from,
Garela, Brazil, and then what we did with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually that's why I know that I
was the first seed producer of white
[SPEAKER_00]: widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Holland, there was a lot of claims
of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've met guys still to this day
have told me that they were the original
[SPEAKER_00]: creator of Masterpush, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, well, I hope Masterpush is
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I know that who knows what
were the parents and they they would tell
[SPEAKER_00]: me Hindu push, Hindu push.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going, yeah, well, I mean,
that doesn't I mean, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows me the area of the valley it
comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I mean, Neville was already
working with so many people in the 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: were working with Afghan Australians
already privately in Australia and Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: and England everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, showing the goods, that was a
different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I always say proof is in
the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bust open the seed and you'll understand
if they've done their work properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they haven't done their work properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people, unfortunately,
because of the no regulations in the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, wouldn't know what the original
was, because maybe they heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They maybe seen a photo, but their version
is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give 10 growers the identical
genetic and they get 10 versions back that
[SPEAKER_00]: look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to really understand that
there's no real story that is 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my story, what I did, but all the
other essay was usually comes from people
[SPEAKER_00]: who were trying to sort of commercialize
something or have a reason or angry or
[SPEAKER_00]: jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't care what people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed my name from White Widow to
Black Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was how much I wanted to go away from
the misrepresented version of what White
[SPEAKER_00]: Widow was turning into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think many people copy me
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few, but I mean, I won't mention
them, but I mean, critical mass is a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect version.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a perfect version.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000, in 1998, I brought it out first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won Planet of the Year in Spain,
2000, 2001, I don't know, one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was critical mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in so many European companies to this
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still sell the original version,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably a better example, to tell you
the truth, because you know, most people
[SPEAKER_00]: have originated from Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of people are always
claiming different things about different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to this day, I never really saw people
prove things, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the growers have bought their
stuff, everyone would normally if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: authentic and real, they'd run over to it
or maybe it was cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that one brought it out at a bulk
rate and they're giving a better deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people slowly, let's say,
tainted the colour of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to know what is original, you know,
it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually you go back to where the seed
was made to that company and asked to
[SPEAKER_00]: start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the most original version of
who made it kind of famous in a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's why people come back to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people come back to Neville
before he passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, I mean, I still have the
criticals, the widows, the hazes,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the old stuff that people were
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept them alive and I can only do
that with original plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's a lot of stories
that came out that people have gone and
[SPEAKER_00]: busted open thousands of seed in Africa
and South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen anything that helps the
Africans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen taking feminized seed to
Africa and swapping it for some soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really helping anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're tanking the crop and you
can claim a lot of things before you've
[SPEAKER_00]: achieved them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they're helping the locals
and that, but actually they're helping
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and they haven't really done
anything that's contributed to,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, the gene bank of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there hasn't been anything
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking, they're commercialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some people believe it and
go along when bigger paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, other people know what
they're doing and know where their origin
[SPEAKER_00]: started from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I think it's better if for
that as a purist that you start from the
[SPEAKER_00]: original story of where that thing
originated from because usually they had
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents to produce it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the proof's in the pudding,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess as an extension of what you
just said, what was it like when you did
[SPEAKER_02]: that rebrand to Mr. Nice Seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think on like a technical and a
marketing level, the name change was a
[SPEAKER_02]: brilliant business move.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also feel like it must have felt
really daunting at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how would you have described it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's hard to come from a number one
company that have repeatedly for four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a row, being, you know, outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new kids on the block had done all the
right things, got all the right new tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: got all the right new flavors,
got everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you better that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought when I met Howard,
I'd already started in 96, I met him,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I was still with the greenhouse
and with Neville, he just moved over to
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just with the coffee shop,
the sheriff, not with the seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were, and I thought, you know,
we were the kind of the dream breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: team at that stage, Neville and myself,
and then Arian was the seller of all those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was going well, we won all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started to think, you know,
it's a little bit corrupt, the high times
[SPEAKER_00]: couple started to go a bit funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, you know, Howard asked me
about making company, I went and spoke to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Listen, Nate, you haven't been
involved with the seeds at Mr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you contribute for and I put in
eight and we start Mr. Nice like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought Howard was the best name in
the industry, better than even great,
[SPEAKER_00]: better than all of us in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was more, he was a brilliant
spokesperson and really wonderful orator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And incredibly colorful character,
and a gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And logically, there was nowhere for me to
go higher than where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to Switzerland for medical with
starting a new company with Howard and
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own the company, I just bought in things
and gave them and share some finances and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that along the way as we build
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hill before I went up the other hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you reach the top,
there's only one one thing to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: either jump or walk down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked down the hill and started
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, other people went
on with the story and but for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I didn't have really a
problem because I know what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, I wouldn't have been so
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have made the critical masses
and the CBD crew and done a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations in the industry, if I didn't
have the goods, and I didn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, and I didn't have the support
from the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone can say what they want,
they can say the stories what they want,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they can claim things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, historically, you can see
things that have happened and changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've usually been the vanguard there,
you know, I've been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I meant in the intro,
one of the grandfather's pillars of the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's been consistent, which is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned the critical mass a few
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you because it is such a
staple, especially in the European scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's these, you know, critical mass,
feminized seeds cross to most hybrids
[SPEAKER_02]: these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you make that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just line bread from some big buds
seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the process of developing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually selected a different male and
hit it with the original big bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Neville's big bud to a different
male that I selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a reworked skunk, actually,
to the truth, a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was made to be, you know,
sort of a huge flower, like a forearm of a
[SPEAKER_00]: boxer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was compact, fragrant, the effect was
incredibly narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that a grower, a commercial
grower wanted to do there was a new work,
[SPEAKER_00]: big bud, we call it critical mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and still to this day,
it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that a lot of people use it in
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably don't even know what it is,
but it grows like a sativa and it flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: like an indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the particular look about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people a bit worried that I've given
them the wrong plant because the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an excellent plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an incredibly good tool for people
who are trying to bring in weight to their
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you don't have things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was uniquely Mr. Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about all the stories of Widow,
the super silvers, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was uniquely set up by Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, a lot of them is the
nice strains we used in CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that went on and all of them were
selling it under different names until I
[SPEAKER_00]: made their seeds with their two varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's why I keep saying
that I'm not trying to be egotistical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what I did and they know what
they did with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of the honest truth is one
thing and maybe the brochures or other
[SPEAKER_00]: things, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, no, of course, we trust your
word, which is, you know, we're really
[SPEAKER_02]: grateful to have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been talking about all these
legendary strains you've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we finally need to chat about your new
site that's in the works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned your son's helping to build
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of things can people expect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will there be a store there where they can
grab your seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And will the auctions continue?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shove Above the Seeds dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the new store?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was speaking to the kids about
was that I've made a lot of Mr Nice has
[SPEAKER_00]: got a shop and will stay how it is at this
moment in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a regular seed company, the integrity
is impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't be compromising that in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but Shove Above the Seeds, I've got a
lot of projects going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought I've got a lot of
sometimes I usually keep back a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed of each project in case something
goes wrong and I can testify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get myself from what people see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it sits in the fridge when
everything goes right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go on with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seeds just sat there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the auctions came about originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now my son was talking to me,
he said, Dad, we seem to have quite a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different things that no one knows
about, you know, the project stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah, I mean, just give it
away to people who are less fortunate or
[SPEAKER_00]: people who come and ask me for help or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I send them batches of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said, yeah, we've done enough to
feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we should just release it under
a different project seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a limited editions that we've made
them and they're finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a deadline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to continue it on,
you want some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always people looking for
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so up until then, I've been offering
it in some seeds with the auctions,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Sarah and my daughter, she's been
doing all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought, you know, Chikoti hadn't
made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's coming back in the Easter
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start to separate some of
these batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give the dates when we made them
and that so people know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll probably offer a lot of those
things, some bulk, you know, 100 pack like
[SPEAKER_00]: older seed where the germinations are
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's definitely some interesting
genetic to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell feminizer or the farm,
but I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shunt above the seeds because I've
made so many for different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making an opinion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make available whatever seed that
we're not using and we're not keeping for
[SPEAKER_00]: backup to other people if they want to,
you know, try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a project, like I told you,
with ground genetics with their tsunami
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and five of my thing, and I've now
offered that out to different growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just send it out this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's on the Mr Nice thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a Shunty Bubba project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we get the website up and
everything done, we'll probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, still continue to use the Mr
Nice forum to discuss Shunty Bubba seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will probably just be a little bit
of other things that have been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure everyone listening to this has
ears of perked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're keen to check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of curiosity, are there any like names
that come to mind of strains that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: offered just to give people an idea of
some of the things they might see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Original hash plant, garlic bud,
heavy duty fruity nub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some projects that I've done, you know,
some original pushers, some very old
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican let's just say the preludes to a
lot of skunks that were Mexican,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian and Afghan in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ortega's, Howard, Howard, not Howard,
Neville Big Parton had a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: numbered Ortega plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've busted open a lot, you know,
I think someone criticized me for mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: up the things last time about Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Neville had everything Ortega,
one, two, three, four, five, six,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, eight, nine crossed with Ortega,
one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the seed, I was just trying to copy
what he's busting open and what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting and where it came from
originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm documenting everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I keep it as honest and truthful
as where it comes from and where the
[SPEAKER_00]: source was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I've got so many different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this Zomal, which we've been,
we worked on quite a lot and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped because I just didn't have any
room anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big plant, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there's so many colors in the
rainbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't have a plan at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really basically thinking that,
you know, my son is going to probably
[SPEAKER_00]: direct traffic in that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got medical rooms opening up for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting gearing up for busting open
some really, really old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some 90s stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just see if we can find some really
interesting kind of phenos and differences
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than all of these push skunk
mixtures that are poly-hybrid at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment and feel like lollipops sometimes,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's too many bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to the turpentine and the
high THC and rather than the whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of natural whole plant that happened
when they combined with different sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: origins, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, just kind of looking
for some old school stuff again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredibly exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure some jaws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit the ground when they heard that,
like, you know, maybe get some garlic bud
[SPEAKER_02]: or some Ortega.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could never really find good info.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that one like, does it come from Jim
Ortega or is it like in honor of him in
[SPEAKER_02]: the way like the Jack Harris train is?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would you describe those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville originally came from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was handed some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether I wasn't there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me a lot of things, but I busted
open the seed that he left me with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely, you know,
a lot of heavy Afghan influence in this
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really, for me, it's solidly coming
to probably an area in that was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: family legacy line that was growing in
Afghan for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Jim Ortega or Neville
doctored up the story or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when I bust open some of
those old stuff, I can see that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some really heavy hitting kind of Indica
based plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never really been one for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's time to sort of release
the track and let it all open up and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can find something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been in it too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: To promise anything to anyone anymore
because you never know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bust it open and you're on for the
ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it can really surprise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can sometimes disappoint you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other times you're elated with the
Eureka moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's the beautiful
adventure of busting open seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of my favorite quotes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every seed is like a prayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting the journey it'll take
you on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you must have been reading my mind
because you've preempted this next
[SPEAKER_02]: question perfectly with the best caveat
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually a fan submitted question
from one of our listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, I really want to grow out
some Mr. Nice seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering, how many packs does Shanty
recommend I pop in order to hopefully find
[SPEAKER_02]: something special?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, I say a sample, a small sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is usually a hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd sell, we say we sell 15 per pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put 18 in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the grower a little bit heads up and
help in case something doesn't work for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've always done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, four or five packs of a
strain is probably the best way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with, if you want to give it a fair thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand if you can't do that,
maybe, you know, minimum would be 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it with two or three,
not regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mind if I hit my, you know,
hit my vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a new vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just show you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks nifty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got your logo on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it keeps the cartridge
in the battery at the bottom and it has
[SPEAKER_00]: different, different modes you can do it
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be in the shop soon as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people can look forward to these nice
vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, I've been looking around for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use the C cell stuff that when I
was driving, I just wanted it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this one's just a bit more powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now some of the THC mixtures that
we're using, which are much thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is better for, it's got different
heat on the coil, different heat settings
[SPEAKER_00]: on the coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually works really well with some of
the thick THC stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to quickly ask, do you feel the
future is in these sort of really
[SPEAKER_02]: convenient portable pen style vapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's a bit like analog
digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think a lot of people still
like to roll joints to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of recreational, the ritual of joint
rolling still is, is a big factor for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think vapes make sense for medical
people who really don't want to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: combustibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but they want a quick hit and they
want to, you know, the volcano was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the wonderful things that was developed,
but not everyone can carry around a
[SPEAKER_00]: volcano with a big bag attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, what we define is that there'll
be a certain section of the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, you know, sort of, I think it's
going to rise because people want clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: non contaminated, non heavy metal,
non pesticide, non insecticide material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's coming in these distillates
that we're making now, because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: very heavy sort of rules for those things
to be made under GMP basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very clean if they're not sort
of pirated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we've got all the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's definitely a medical tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's very convenient for those
who are driving long distance that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to roll a joint, don't want to stick
out the car, but they need a quick hit and
[SPEAKER_00]: that just, you know, back pain or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, what we, what I advise is
we make a pill basically against THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the vape is for when it's
starting to fade, you hit it up for
[SPEAKER_00]: another hour or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, we use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of prescribe that to people
who are in the medical fraternity over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suppose that it will be continually
growing in until you reach a level in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market in Australia that is maybe,
you know, I don't know, 300,000 at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment, maybe a million people sign up to
be medical users over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll reach a level and maybe you'll see
20, 30% of the market is doing vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will probably be the medical
ones, still the ones doing the pills or
[SPEAKER_00]: the oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a large section of,
let's say, free thinking people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who use it for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe then there's going to be the
black market is going to be fed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: white market eventually because it's going
cheaper than the black market in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so eventually those things will happen
naturally as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just logic for people who are in
different situations, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I suppose, I mean, you know,
I'm just trying to call it how I see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean, it's probably something like
that, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a slightly unrelated note, I wanted to
ask, citrus terpenes are really popular in
[SPEAKER_02]: modern cannabis, the amandarin and orange
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed that there isn't really a
ton of citrus in your genetic lineup on
[SPEAKER_02]: face value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this because you're not particularly
into that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just coincidence?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about orange and citrus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when you bust open a few things,
you get the citrusy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the mango and the sucrose,
there's definitely things that go towards
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have, and actually that was one
of the other ones, the original orange
[SPEAKER_00]: bud, which was really orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what we were selling in the coffee
shops in the early 90s, the Californian
[SPEAKER_00]: orange was one of those first skunks that
really combined its flavor specifically to
[SPEAKER_00]: that line of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were some that deviated a
little bit, were a bit more lemony and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of amandarin-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I suppose the berries and
they're, you know, they all sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the selection of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of think that I've got a lot of
them in my plants already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that I don't have specifically
targeted that line of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that in my 40-odd strains
that you can find specific things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I explained to you before,
70% is similar, 15 to each side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I consider stable
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows hobby growers to go to
that 15% either side and find things to do
[SPEAKER_00]: more pure formant to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, I'm passing the
baton most of the time nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm starting to think that there's
some really good guys out there that need
[SPEAKER_00]: just a hand with some old genetic tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still got them in the arsenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pass them out, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've certainly heard more recently a
lot of the more sort of newer modern
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders referencing that they're actually
really keen and specifically throw your
[SPEAKER_02]: name out there as stock they want to run
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to admit, a bit of an oversight
in my last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a super silver haze hybrid that is
very citrusy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to correct the record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not good in the phrasing of that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kudos to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of sort of strains that I
don't really write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer you to find what you're liking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, I heard that many times
from those strains that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things available there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it segues nicely into the next
question, which is like you've worked with
[SPEAKER_02]: this same really solid base of genetics
for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know in the last episode,
you mentioned that for the most part,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not particularly interested in some
of the more new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know, do you ever see yourself
maybe incorporating a little more modern
[SPEAKER_02]: or new stuff into the arsenal?
[SPEAKER_00]: That project with grounded genetics is
using one of their, I think it arrived
[SPEAKER_00]: from Skittles and maybe I'm wrong,
but I know that he's working with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a young guy, like him a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's very open and honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's very fanatical about the sort of
ideas in his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was hoping to find something that we
sell a lot of seeds to Morocco,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of bulk seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking specifically for hash
strains that are really good, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing large amounts of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think in this tsunami,
I think the Northern Light Five Hays with
[SPEAKER_00]: the tsunami or the Black Widow with the
tsunami might be really interesting hash
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a G13 with the tsunami,
which I think he's already grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the seed, it looked toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it will be really interesting
either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You usually see the year after we've made
the seed, some people have put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pollen comes back to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to know if it's knocking
people out or if it's some sort of extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, we work with all
different types of characters and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: take them all seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in a long winded sense,
you get to reap the fruit of your labor
[SPEAKER_02]: when you say when the hash comes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of curiosity, is that you just have
like a contact who you just offload seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: to and they distribute it locally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just to like a big farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say what I best describe it
without writing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a few people who have been
working in Morocco for many years,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, a lot of Spanish,
Dutch, English people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them have blocks of land now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come and purchase a few hundred
thousand seeds at a time of four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the year later, they come back
with a lot of the pollen already
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-pressed or pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And goes on the market, commercial market
as the Moroccan hashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this year I saw pineapple
skunk and all these different things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been sort of making for different
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come back as pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's again like the winemaker,
the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the hash maker and how clean
they are and what press it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what pass it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a first pass, you can see it's
really gray and incredible hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets down to the green stuff,
which is like the old French papers or
[SPEAKER_00]: different versions of just commercial
quality stuff, probably second,
[SPEAKER_00]: third or fourth pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, when it gets too green,
I start to go the other direction usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have never known.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're kind of on the tail end of it,
we've got a few fan submitted questions
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to run by you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the first one I want to quickly ask
before we jump into them is a bit earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: on, we were talking about the challenges
in maintaining a library over the long
[SPEAKER_02]: term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to ask you, there's a common
topic discussed in the community about
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of the loss of vigor or maybe you'd
call it like genetic deterioration.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's various terms used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that plants deteriorate over
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you say that it's genetic drift
or just some alternative sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: deterioration?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I think that's a lot of
bullshit, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're preserving plants in a
very good environment and specifically we
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, we take our old mothers outside
after nine months and we grow them for one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two months outside and take a new
cutting from the new growth and bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: in for the next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing that for some plants
that are like 30 odd years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't see any deterioration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that I see nowadays is a
lot more people passing different things
[SPEAKER_00]: to different people and viruses are now
becoming impacting the industry and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I don't bring in any plants
in my greenhouse in America or in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: from anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do all of our mothers and all of our
clients are done in the facility for the
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only dry flower go out or seeds go out
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have cleaned laboratory
controlled testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anything, like just recently there
was a pink lemonade clone found in one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular room in Switzerland that was
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like it had the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the CEO of the company I work
with now, Berg Bluten in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went there straight away,
took a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took a sample from our mother
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took a sample from another
mother room that I have, especially away
[SPEAKER_00]: from those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them were infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know how they got infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we killed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all of them backed up in the
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that it's going to take
nine months to grow out before we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last one, which is closer to me,
that was clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to take a cutting from that
and bring it back into the old area once
[SPEAKER_00]: they cleaned out everything and sprayed it
all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was maybe from scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been from someone touching
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been brought in from other
rooms to that room because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of traffic there, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to frighten anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to say work clean,
dip with alcohol, wash your hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: use gloves when you're working with
mothers and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that area for me is the most
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep that solid, if you grow up
mothers each year outside in the sunlight,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sort of precautionary things,
you will never have issues to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: with genetic drift and this so-called
genetic drift anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat it like a photocopy of a
photocopy of a photocopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe that because every year I
reset it outside and I bring it in and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more fit than it was nine months
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor light will eventually, it's not
natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything grown not naturally for too long
will start to have some changes taking
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And possibly they're not as healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some animal issues that are
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden you start to see
this plant not performing very well
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just unhealthy, non-fit mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, that's reassuring to hear that
you can sort of reinvigorate them by
[SPEAKER_02]: giving them that season outside that the
sun is revitalizing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And building on what you've said,
you know, you've expressed a pretty clear
[SPEAKER_02]: concern about the hoplatin virus and it
does feel a bit out of sight, out of mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a bit concerning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have concerns that like a new virus
will emerge or do you think that the
[SPEAKER_02]: hoplatin is the one to be concerned about
and it's just going to persist?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm a biologist, a plant
biologist, if you want to label it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, monoculture breeds new
viruses, unfortunately, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculturing really intensely at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anything that everyone thinks is
raining money, you know, all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the big guns come in, set up the
big greenhouses and they don't really,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not passionate about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just looking for the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, with those sort of operations,
we're going to see a lot more viruses
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of weird viruses already
very minutely affecting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep an eye on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's one that makes the
plant kind of look like a cousin it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the name, I think, beet,
beet virus or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You realize that distinctly bacterial
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, if you, Rob Clark made a
book, Hemp, and he covered a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses in that, that had already been
established in Hemp for many years
[SPEAKER_00]: already, and they're going to jump,
they're going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: People networking and crossing over and
passing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, it's natural we have
viruses living in the atmosphere and
[SPEAKER_00]: around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if you want to keep your room
clean and devoid of that sort of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: then have a quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to bring in plants into a
certain area, quarantine them in another
[SPEAKER_00]: tent first for a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure, or do a flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that everything's clean and
you're using clean tools before you let
[SPEAKER_00]: them come into the main room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of that protocol nowadays
with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't allow people who don't need to
be there to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to take, you know, a lot of people
around, show them around and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it was to our detriment in the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we're closed shop now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really come out and probably I
don't do the show so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I'm still available online and
I'm very easy to talk to if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to be involved with the kids
helping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're helping me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of, I find it in a really
good stage at the moment of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the next generation is, I don't say
that they're going to be always
[SPEAKER_00]: interested, but at the moment they need
some financial independence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got them on a carrot at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully they bring to the table
stuff that I've got no idea about,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it's pretty evident they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're a pretty good team at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, understandable that you have to
tighten the belt with the quarantine given
[SPEAKER_02]: the viruses and gosh, if only we could all
be so lucky to have a father like yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: dangling such an incredible carrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're a sweet guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the next generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you, because I know you
work with some big facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new generation of lighting,
are you sold on LEDs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you prefer the old school HPS metal
halide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not sold on anything that doesn't
prove itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a lot of LEDs in the mother rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone back to combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mother rooms, I still use some
Sontay Phillips high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: interspersed with a lot of LEDs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a blend of spectrum there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mothers respond well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones, LEDs fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the LEDs in the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use tube light, fluorescence,
and they're always very soft, cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool white, you know, kind of tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've gone on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in big greenhouse in
America, we're basically not on LEDs at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just changed all the globes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on 600 waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are producing huge amounts on
living soil and excellent quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm open to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a guy that is the first on the
block to get new technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see it proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be the first on the block to try
out new reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sort of dabble in keeping males
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no value for people keeping males
alive most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm driving males from five different
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no value for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have to pay them to keep them
there and growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, my jobs vary depending what
jumper I'm wearing that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, now we make flowers for
certain companies in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Australia, and kind of,
you know, now we're trying to spread our
[SPEAKER_00]: wings a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the market is still emerging in
Europe, the legal medical market is still
[SPEAKER_00]: not tight and with a distinct direction in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as developed as in Australia
or America or Canada at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just getting aligned for that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, I believe very strongly that
France and Germany will be at the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some other countries,
Italy, Spain, and Greece, maybe they're
[SPEAKER_00]: lingering behind watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Europe's not one country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might sound like it's a conglomerate,
but it's still, they've still got
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultural differences,
you know, and there's definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stigmas, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Switzerland, we're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I really appreciate the Swiss for
that reason, that they actually allow a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of stuff to happen, take place in
indoor facilities in certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what we're doing, we have to
announce it and we have to try to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: it as best we can before we've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they come along and check and,
you know, they do what they say and we do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as that's all going along,
pretty OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our last question for this interview,
I've been waiting to ask you, what,
[SPEAKER_02]: in your opinion, is some of the best
genetic stock you've ever worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I suppose if I have to think about
it over all my career, OK, I was probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the most excited of my life when I came
across and when we started to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: something from Main Arm in Australia many
years ago when I was at university,
[SPEAKER_00]: we called it Mullum Bimmy Badness,
but there was a lot of I think we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about this last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember growing this from seed
with Rob, one of the guys, the main grower
[SPEAKER_00]: and smuggling it down in pillows,
you know, someone in the pillows and down
[SPEAKER_00]: at Melbourne University and goes in a
matter of hours, you know, it was like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was it never disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of these strains that it's like
Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still see no matter what anyone says,
how you use the name Hayes or Mullum Bimmy
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, it was an early development
of of definitely Colombian Thai things in
[SPEAKER_00]: that time, you know, and we used to grow
it year after year from seed and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: never disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I came across it when I bumped
into Neville in Europe many years later in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hayes version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I always called it an
Australian Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't prove that it came from
completely different sources, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it might not have the origins
originally, the countries it came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might have been very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like I said,
I say to you many times, mate,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're the hands of nature at best and
we get things from the last generation and
[SPEAKER_00]: they got things from the generation before
and hopefully we improve on it and we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't sort of, you know, sort of diverse
and deviate, sorry, from the good
[SPEAKER_00]: direction and just make it commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain amount of breeders that
do a really good cottage industry job with
[SPEAKER_00]: certain strains and they don't need to do
50 strains, they need to do two or one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that incredibly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they should be acknowledged for that
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of really fantastic
growers out there that have been keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: things alive for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just timing of my life was
probably I was in a lucky situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I had all the guys around
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know they were the guys at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're just normal guys,
smoking a joint, drinking a glass of wine
[SPEAKER_00]: or something, you know, in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so stoked to hear again how special
the Mullen Bibi Madness was to you and the
[SPEAKER_02]: similarities with Neville Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of it for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any comments or shout outs you want to
make?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just appreciate you taking the time to
delve into some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I stimulate your your viewers
into and if they ever want to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, they're more than welcome to
come to the website and talk directly
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty approachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I treat everyone as equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we and boys and girls, every type of
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're in an industry which is
trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still some people in there trying
to maintain a good integrity and try to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the right job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're linking up with a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still think that there's as much as
the cops and negative feedback from even
[SPEAKER_00]: people within the industry, I think
there's a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping the direction that takes
will be the right one eventually and will
[SPEAKER_00]: be there for the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
