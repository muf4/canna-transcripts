[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
the podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_00]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode was brought to you by 420
Australia for all your clothing and
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle needs, as well as Mad Pharma
Genetics, your go-to purple cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're joined by the Mad
Pharma to talk about all things purple
[SPEAKER_00]: urkel, some of his strains, as well as
some of his future breeding plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, so I'd like to welcome Mad
Pharma onto this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for taking the time to join
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back to the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you get into weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know the answer to this one,
but was it a friend influencing you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it more of a family thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were some of the strains that
were around when you first started
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, well, I've been in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in it as long as I can remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something my mom and dad had always
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole family, all my dad's brothers,
sister, they, you know, they all smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't something that they hid from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we knew not to talk about with
others, but it was a family affair.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my parents were honest with us about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then it wasn't, it wasn't called
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was basically called getting high,
but we knew it as what we knew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the seventies were kind of
a different generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grew up in the seventies and
eighties and being around it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: different experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother and I both kind of stayed on
the path, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of deviated from the path for a few
years because I went to school and tried
[SPEAKER_03]: to go mainstream with things, but it
wasn't my passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could tell I wasn't happy doing
mainstream work and the nine to five that
[SPEAKER_03]: most people, most people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plus I was diagnosed when I was 24
with SLE.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that kind of changed my life
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went back to my roots because I knew
the benefits at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had become more of a topic about the
medical aspect of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was taking so many different
medications that everything would make me
[SPEAKER_03]: nauseous all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't keep food down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, I felt sick all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were certain strains that
really, really were beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finding certain strains sometimes
weren't as easy, even in the circles that
[SPEAKER_03]: I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't the easiest thing to find
certain strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I decided, my wife and I,
after long discussions, we sat down and we
[SPEAKER_03]: just decided, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to leave my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't do anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had become addicted to big pharmas,
wonderful narcotics, and it was just,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My kidneys were shutting down.
[SPEAKER_03]: My liver wasn't working properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was down to 20%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a daughter on the way and it just,
it was a time that we needed to make a
[SPEAKER_03]: decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I look back now, it was the best
decision I ever made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have my dad to thank for that
because it was him that really showed us
[SPEAKER_03]: what pot was about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even before it was the medicinal factor,
it was a way of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the reason, that was the
reason I was born into the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The family that I was born into,
this is something that's, when an artist
[SPEAKER_03]: paints in him, he says that when he's
doing it, it's just something that he
[SPEAKER_03]: loves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an expression of himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how I feel about what we do is
when I'm with the plants, I just feel
[SPEAKER_03]: they're an extension of who I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I express myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a kind of, you know, a powerful
recount of how you got into this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look back at it now and you think
everything was meant to happen the way it
[SPEAKER_03]: happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just a firm believer in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because things that have happened
with cannabis and without cannabis have
[SPEAKER_03]: all led me back to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just know that that was the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's why that's one of my,
you know, clearest recollections is the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact that it was meant to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I remember it being only
five years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just having that thought, I mean,
it's like a picture in my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was a ginormous outdoor Cali
skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the entire house, I mean,
everything smelled like my dad had just
[SPEAKER_03]: brought a skunk into the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a vivid, pungent, pungent memory
in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it sounds like the whole family was
growing kind of the whole time you were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point did you decide to transition
from grower to breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe more, should I say, back in those
days, was there the distinction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were people just farmers and a lot of
people made their own seed for the
[SPEAKER_01]: following season?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, was there still a somewhat
clear distinction as there is today
[SPEAKER_01]: between, say, growers and breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, when did you decide to make the
transition?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as far as it was back then,
there was no coin term of a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: When my dad, and I won't say his name,
but my dad had a best friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And between those two, they were the best
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing things back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is in the mid to late 70s that
people are just now starting to do now
[SPEAKER_03]: with the no till experience that it was
kind of when I look back now, it's mind
[SPEAKER_03]: boggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they needed to continue the lines
that they had, it would be a male that
[SPEAKER_03]: they would have from the same lines that
they had and they would have one and it
[SPEAKER_03]: would pollinate the surrounding plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that would be the seeds that they
would continue on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You figure they would do one pollination
and they would have enough seeds for years
[SPEAKER_03]: of growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was no coin term of breeders
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just farming and they were farming
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as for me, getting into the
actual art of breeding, it was
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically for my medicinal benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to create strains that were going
to help me with the symptoms of my lupus,
[SPEAKER_03]: my SSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what led me down the road of
doing it, of getting into it, because
[SPEAKER_03]: there were certain lines that were more
beneficial for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the reason why I am so heavily
involved with with purple pot is because
[SPEAKER_03]: of the medicinal benefits that it offers
me for my particular disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the reason that I got back
into breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it became as much of a passion as
actually growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was something that I just
absolutely fell in love with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just grew from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just blossomed from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that same idea, I was actually
wondering, do you think that it's possible
[SPEAKER_01]: to predict actively breed a strain for a
specific need?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hear, you know, certain strains are
good for, say, IBS or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in your case, you just mentioned,
you know, certain strains are good for
[SPEAKER_01]: your SLE.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that you could say,
I'm going to cross this strain with this
[SPEAKER_01]: strain and I predict that it will be good
for Crohn's or something based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: parent's lineage, maybe, or something like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think like, no, it's not really
a predictable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just turns out certain strains are good
for certain things, but I doubt we'll ever
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to predict it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I for me, I think the two strains that
come to mind that I have personally found
[SPEAKER_03]: the most medicinal benefits from are
lavender and purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have a quality about them that
it was nausea for instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's been my biggest issue is the
nausea and the stomach, the cramping and
[SPEAKER_03]: the pain with the IBS and the Crohn's
because I've had 13 surgeries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a rough, rough road and the
idea of taking medications and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lavender and the purple oracle,
I can pick them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And though I've been smoking them for so
many years, I don't get stoned on them per
[SPEAKER_03]: se anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll have a nice little relaxing
buzz, but I don't really smoke those to
[SPEAKER_03]: really get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke those for a purpose and I don't
really go anywhere without them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can take either one of those and I
can work those and the progeny from those
[SPEAKER_03]: 80%, I would say of the time are going to
carry the same benefit as the mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as your male selection is proper
and you're staying either within the line
[SPEAKER_03]: or as close to the line as you can,
you're going to carry that trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the reason why I had stayed
within those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, I cannot be without those two
strings and I've had those two strings for
[SPEAKER_03]: over 16 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was actually going to say,
yeah, I read online that the oracle cut
[SPEAKER_01]: has been in your family's possession for
over 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really impressive, if it is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get the oracle cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you did know kind of a bit about
its history that you wouldn't mind
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing, it's one of those strains where
people speculate about the genetic but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of hard to know what's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not been 25 years that we've
had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would probably be closer to 19,
around 19, maybe 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's any time you can keep a plant
that's designed to have one season,
[SPEAKER_03]: it flowers and it's done alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: For that long, you've done something
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have quite a few moms that we've had
for 10 plus years, 12 plus years,
[SPEAKER_03]: but my babies have been with us for the
longest time and we've kept them alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel is a, she has a mystique.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just what she is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the true identity behind purple urkel
truly, truly isn't known.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason is, is because the name
game wasn't this huge, oh, I have this
[SPEAKER_03]: line or I have this line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, we had Sensemia,
you either had seedless or you didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my family was known for producing the
best seedless marijuana that most people
[SPEAKER_03]: had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there wasn't a name game.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back then, a lot of the land race
crossings were starting to come because
[SPEAKER_03]: you had South American weed that was
really into parts of California,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in the Central Valley,
having really long summers that you could
[SPEAKER_03]: carry all the way into November.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were able to flower indoor streams
that would be 19 or 20-weekers with a
[SPEAKER_03]: little assistance and help.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could push them to full term.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the, especially with my dad,
he really liked the speedy weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: the ampy weed, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing that he didn't really
care for was the really long growing
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when a lot of the Hindu Kush
was starting to make its way over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you had the Afghanistan and
Russian conflict.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my dad had friends in the Peace Corps
that were bringing seeds back from
[SPEAKER_03]: different areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when a lot of the real true
land race hybrids were being started.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had pure Sativa lines for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being pollinated by super short,
stocky, wide Indica plants that a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people had never even seen before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were using them in what we have
coined, breeding projects now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where a lot of it got started
was back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with Urkel, there was no names.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the biggest reason that there's
the big question mark as to the lineage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when it was created, there just
wasn't a lot of names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the lines had ended up down
the road becoming one of the northern
[SPEAKER_03]: lights by Thai crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that it was the male side
that was the Indica side of things on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just wasn't a conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would always be about the plant,
for the plant, with the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was trait expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't so much in the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why when people ask me,
hey, why don't your crosses carry names?
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain ones do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they carry their names after the fact
that they've been grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a name that you can actually
see in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was called this because this is
what she smelled like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what she looked like, tasted like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tell people not to get caught up in
the name because it's meaningless.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was about the time and the
traits, about the expressions of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the idea that this one was done
by the end of September.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one over here, we were carrying
into the middle of November and probably
[SPEAKER_03]: could have given her an extra two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the idea of putting them together just
made a whole lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how it got started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the hybrid craze really got
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you had old school skunk lines
that were powerful and supercharged sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you had indica lines that had the
same tear profiles, the same expressions,
[SPEAKER_03]: the same smells.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they looked completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would always try and find things
that in your head, you could just put them
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could actually see them being well
matched together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with Urkel, there was a lot of
northern lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what ended up being coined as
northern lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ty going around, a lot of Ty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those two ended up having a party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they became a single line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also when you started seeing a
lot of color, a lot of the Afghans that
[SPEAKER_03]: were coming over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were turning black about the final month
of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Temperatures had a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you just didn't see a whole,
whole lot of it at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we started to see, well,
we, I have more of my dad and crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once they started to see those
expressions, it was just a whole different
[SPEAKER_03]: realm of weed that they were now getting
to experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a no brainer working with it
for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's when you started seeing
the purple lines really start to pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sativa dominant purple lines from the
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The indica dominant purple lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And purple Urkel was a product of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: She just was something that was really
really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of going back to a point you
made a few minutes ago about some hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: in relation to Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this kind of has a bit of a
bigger underlying question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, how do you think Urkel has
managed to stay within kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream of weed culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: At least kind of always peripherally
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that, I mean, like to me,
granddaddy purple is one of those strains
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's good, you know, like,
I don't mind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always have to remind people,
like, you know, the speculated genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: are Urkel cross big bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you look at big bud,
we know what its job is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the extrapolation would be that Urkel
is going to be like the connoisseur
[SPEAKER_01]: granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why do you think Urkel has managed to
stay kind of present in mainstream
[SPEAKER_01]: culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is one of those ones that it's
always popping up, but it's never the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor of the month, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with Urkel, I think there's three
reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the mysterious factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to know what exactly it
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, it is an amazingly gorgeous plant to
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just everybody complains that grows her
that she's a slow veger and she can be a
[SPEAKER_03]: slow veger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow a lot of pots that's extremely
painful, painfully slow in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third, I think, would be her
intoxicating smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, her taste, because the true
Urkel cut, the actual Urkel cut is a hazy,
[SPEAKER_03]: smoky, if you will, grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavor that is very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those things that really
goes well with food.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people make the relation
to cannabis and food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you put those three factors
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think that she's just carried
on that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, everywhere I go with Urkel,
with friends, I don't go around
[SPEAKER_03]: advertising who I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a very recluse individual,
and probably one of the most recluse
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals that you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the circle of friends that I have,
even the same guys will ask me,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you think it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had this conversation three weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean, what do I think it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's the mysterious factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just that, just a gorgeous,
gorgeous plant when she flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, obviously I've already stated that
it was the medicinal factor that she
[SPEAKER_03]: serves for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's just one of the most beautiful
plants to flower out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't be without her.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have her.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be something that when it's my time
to go, I'll turn over to my child and
[SPEAKER_03]: explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: She already knows that it's what,
I've always been honest with her.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she knows what certain things mean to
me and how special they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, obviously, plus my wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they know there are certain things
that, like your name, you want to carry
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll want to do everything you possibly
can to continue on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll be something that I turn over
to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll make it clear that keep her
around as long as you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're tired of her, pass her to
somebody that will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just what it is for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I can't speak for everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even if she didn't have the medicinal
effect for me that she does, it would
[SPEAKER_03]: still be one of those plants that I keep
around just because she's that unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: She works well with others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all about her expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's intoxicating to the eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's intoxicating to the nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's intoxicating on your taste buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when your body is into something that
much with that many of your senses,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why she stays with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think maybe that's why it is
something that is so highly sought after.
[SPEAKER_03]: By others is those three factors is the
fact that it is a mysterious strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But besides that, she's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's explosive with flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to move on to some of your
strains, because I actually wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight some of your strains for people
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one, what I think is maybe
your hallmark strain in a way is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Tripoli Wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is obviously made from the
lavender, which we mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as what you said is the male side
of the purple opal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you mentioned that was what
eventually became the Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights by Ty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you describe this strain to
someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I can see, it looks like the
one you've worked the most with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you decide to work with it so
extensively?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would be your kind of sales pitch
to someone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with the Tripoli Wicked,
first, let me say that I refer to her a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot as T-dub.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, especially here on the
West Coast, when they hear the term T-dub,
[SPEAKER_03]: they automatically assume trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm referring to, I don't like T-dub,
I don't like trainwreck, it's not my cup
[SPEAKER_03]: of tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a bitch to work with, very unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The buzz isn't that unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: She just grows erratic, she stretches.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she just wasn't my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a real big OG fan either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you hear me refer to T-dub,
it will never be trainwreck, it will
[SPEAKER_03]: always be Tripoli Wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get asked that question a lot,
so I wanted to clarify that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: T-dub is a very special, very special
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male that we got was actually,
when my dad had passed away, a family
[SPEAKER_03]: friend, which the friendship,
unfortunately, has kind of degraded
[SPEAKER_03]: because of the popularity that was gained
by the three strains that we used to
[SPEAKER_03]: create with the mill that we were blessed
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in honor of my dad, because my dad
had a love for purple pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And originally it was gonna be the
lavender and the urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the male was noted as Tripoli.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're working with strains,
usually they'll be documented as a letter
[SPEAKER_03]: and a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending where they are in the garden,
it's just easier to track them with
[SPEAKER_03]: letters and numbers because of the rows
and the placement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we went ahead and labeled said mill
as Tripoli.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of an heirloom line,
and it was from the male side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: responsible party for creating the urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a very heavy, leaning northern
lights by Thai hybrid line that's really
[SPEAKER_03]: expressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It carried a heavy, heavy, heavy,
which we didn't know at the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: had no clue, a citrus turf profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say citrus, I guess I should
just say tangerines because it literally
[SPEAKER_03]: smelled, most of the plants, even the
mills on the stem rub, you could smell it,
[SPEAKER_03]: just three or four weeks into flower would
start to smell as if you were peeling a
[SPEAKER_03]: really, really really sweet tangerine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't expect that at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we got the mill, which was Tripoli.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in honor of my dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to do something that was gonna
be unique, something that had,
[SPEAKER_03]: to my knowledge, had not been done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were blessed with the mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we went ahead with it and we used
him to pollinate our lavender,
[SPEAKER_03]: which became Tripoli Wicked in honor of my
father, our purple urkel, which became
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple Jackie, again, in honor of my
father.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those were the two we were gonna
use in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was a last minute decision
that we threw in our SEDC.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't specific for my dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's probably been with us out of all our
elite mothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's been with us the least amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've had her for around 11,
11, maybe close to 12 years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put her in late and she became the
triple deep crippler.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ended up becoming just the things
that ended up happening that you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: control and how a person is gonna react.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it became such an issue that we ended
up just killing the one male that I,
[SPEAKER_03]: to this day, wish I would have just rode
out the turmoil and kept the mill itself
[SPEAKER_03]: because he was the most expressive mill,
speaking on turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turp profiles, the most expressive mill
that I've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we ended up killing him just to kind
of try and keep a relationship,
[SPEAKER_03]: a friendship, which ended up failing
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did away with him and we decided
to carry on with the three.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kept to our end of the bargain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do anything more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had the three lines, the T-dub,
the PJ and the TDC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just the triple E was so dominant,
so amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that I look back and I've grown
literally probably a thousand of these,
[SPEAKER_03]: the three that we created, I have seen how
predictable of a man I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male doesn't matter the female,
how predictable he's gonna be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anytime you can find a male that is
predictable in what he's gonna do,
[SPEAKER_03]: it makes your job easy because you know
what to expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And triple E was that male.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that you hear the most
right now about the T-dub is because when
[SPEAKER_03]: we work a line, we don't just create the
line and then put it out there and then
[SPEAKER_03]: move on to the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: We create the line, we work from within
the line because I just feel that you now
[SPEAKER_03]: know that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: You now know what she's capable of doing,
the predictability factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just so much about her that you
now know why do you wanna just jump into
[SPEAKER_03]: something else that's an unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we continued on for a while,
a few years with the T-dub.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why you continue to hear about
the T-dub.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're now moving into the PJ aspect,
the purple Jackie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is the same, it's the triple E
male.
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead of the lavender mom,
it's the Urkel mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's probably more expressive with the
Urkel than he was with the lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one, it's gonna raise some
eyebrows, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, it's high citrus
expressions in the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: The buds are a little more chunky,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: The calyxes are a little more swollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little larger, the hairs are a little
brighter orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just stand out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The potency factor is right there with the
T-dub.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the reason why too with the T-dub
we stayed with it for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it had amazing medicinal effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she just was a little bit light in the
power aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just felt I could bring that out a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just played with the line for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoyed it thoroughly and created many
hybrid lines with the T-dub.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, we were working with
the TDC and the PJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just not openly and dumping them on
whoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we like to stick with a
single project as far as our focal point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we always have at least one most of
the time two other projects that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of doing in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: And T-dub was just the first one from what
we did for my dad was the first one that
[SPEAKER_03]: we brought mainstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that we allowed to come out to the
masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you much like one of my favorite
breeders, Dynasty, appear to work in kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a methodical way in that what you do is
you've got kind of your pool of base
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in your case, it's kind of the
Clementine, the T-dub, the Urkel and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Queen, a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you kind of mix and match your flavors
from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like this approach because,
I mean, for one, that Clementine I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned isn't the DNA Clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one you made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of those are actually your own
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to me like you've made a lot
of the possible combinations there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my immediate thought was, what's Mad
Farmers next move?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to bring some new genetics
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then make some new combinations with
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe refine some of the old genetics
by, I know that you took the T-dub to the
[SPEAKER_01]: F2, maybe do that with some other strains
and then begin reworking from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what's your plan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I said, here with us,
it's about what, first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_03]: what my preference is as a smoking
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll always go with that first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been one to breed with the cut
of the month strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of people will get what's
popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the cookies and the GG4.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Archive has come out with a
do-si-do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are all amazing in their own
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would never, ever try to dick
somebody and say, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're working with shit or, you know,
you created shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never, because that's somebody's passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd never do that whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a cut of the month breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am really methodical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of OCD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I'm on something, I stay on
something until I'm completely satisfied
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's coming next is the,
is the PJ and you'll see PJ hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male that we have that we're working
with was chosen, oh my, over three
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was three seasons that we took
to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot, a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you have a field of just
males, it's, you know, it's just like
[SPEAKER_03]: growing females.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking for specifics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're smelling for specifics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're documenting flower times.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask me, do you really smoke them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the males you can actually
get, you can get a bit of a buzz on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had, like with our PJ, I have males
that'll produce resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good amounts of resin to the point to
where you can turn them into a
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you, you, you can actually
extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, your, your percentages aren't
going to be anything close to what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get with a female flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is, it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't just say, well, this line
produced this smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this smell looks like he's got
everything I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that's not good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I, I, I have to see him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to touch him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to smell him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to smoke him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to know what he's going to give me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with our PJ, it's, it's everything
that I wanted from my PJ male.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has the, the blood red pedioles.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has that citrus funk on the stem rub.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has the quicker flowering time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has the little bit further node
spacing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has that gorgeous double serrated leaf
edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just everything about him.
[SPEAKER_03]: His pollen sacks are vivid violet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put him in a field of 25 other males
and he's going to be the one that stands
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be the one that screams,
here I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choose me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then typically we don't ever,
you know, post pictures of our males or
[SPEAKER_03]: show our males, but he has impressed us so
much that I've actually posted a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures of him just because he's caught
my fancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if I've had a male that
has, has excited me as much as,
[SPEAKER_03]: as this PJ male.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to work the PJ line.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to F2 the line first and
foremost and bring out the, the F2s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll take him to, you know,
to what we consider our elite mothers,
[SPEAKER_03]: our, you know, our brood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll start to introduce him to,
you know, like our heirloom clementine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't ever bring in outside cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: For one, it's, it's kind of a bad practice
because it's a sanitary issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the most clean gardens can carry
hitchhikers that are unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can go down to your damn pro
shop and bring home hitchhikers because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's so many farmers in and out of the
shop that they, you know, the spider might
[SPEAKER_03]: will follow him, you know, be on his shoes
or pants and ended up jumping onto a
[SPEAKER_03]: product that you bring home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, and yeah, you can quarantine and,
you know, there's plenty of methods to
[SPEAKER_03]: eradicate anything possible that you can
bring in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but again, we're really recluse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, our social circle is small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we just, we don't bring in a lot
of outside cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look back just in the last
three years at, at, uh, what popular
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, um, strains, uh, you've had,
you know, a lot of them come and go,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, here in California, you go back
just a few years and you had lines like,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, uh, snow cap and train wreck and,
you know, a lot of the lines they come and
[SPEAKER_03]: go, uh, cookies that seem to have stuck
around for a while, but even cookies now
[SPEAKER_03]: is kind of starting to, uh, expand out
into hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everybody now has cookie hybrids
where before it was just straight cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wanted cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: GG four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're seeing in a lot of hybrids and
I'm just, I'm old school, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's not that I don't dig those
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that when it comes to my work,
uh, to what I'm doing, to what my vision
[SPEAKER_03]: is, um, I don't know enough about those
lines to feel confident when I bring them
[SPEAKER_03]: in, that I'm going to create something
that the growers are going to get and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: damn, you know, that's all I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I want to know what I'm working with
and I want to know the ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't just want to know its name and
what it smells like and what it looks like
[SPEAKER_03]: and tastes like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what it's doing on week six
on an indoor flower run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what it's doing in
September on an outdoor flower run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I want to know, uh, you know,
how big is she going to get in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: patch?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is she going to do on organics?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is she going to do on synthetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know these things and there's
only one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just takes time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people, uh, bite me for,
uh, you know, only having what seems to be
[SPEAKER_03]: a small set of lines that we work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not because I don't have access or I
can't acquire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get, I can get whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's just the fact that this is how my
brain works.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, um, this is my commitment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lot like my dad in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's for my personal
consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I'm working with something,
it needs to be more than what I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to know, like I said, what she's
going to do in September on an outdoor run
[SPEAKER_03]: on synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to know what she's going to do in
September outdoor on organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, that's, that's just how we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems like we're, we're really,
really simplified in, in, in what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in reality, it's not simplified at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot going on that most people
will never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, the, a quick little caveat I
would chuck in there is that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: from my experience, from talking to people
and just personally breeders like yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: and other people who do have that kind of
limited base and mix and match,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to be able to give by far the
most accurate description of their
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think that kind of speaks
for itself in a lot of ways, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you organic or synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you just mentioned before that
you might consider taking the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: Jackies to the F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, would you, would you ever consider
doing a cubing process or do you think,
[SPEAKER_01]: nah, doing back crossings, not so much
what I'm looking to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what makes F2s an ideal thing for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you aim to refine
characteristics in that process or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like why choose the F2 over say
a BX?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, with a PJ we are, we're going to
cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I want to get, uh, as close to the
Urkel in seed form as I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the growers to get a 10 pack of
seeds and have seven of them come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, damn, they're spitting images of
purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's our goal in the PJ is I
just feel, and that, and this is no slight
[SPEAKER_03]: on Lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I probably should have done it with
her, uh, but there's just so many other
[SPEAKER_03]: things moving with her that we just didn't
get around to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of our biggest goals with the PJ
is to cube her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I want to see Urkel dominance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want people to be able to experience,
you know, the true Urkel, um, in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in its, its form, not, not some S one,
uh, not some, oh, this is in quotation
[SPEAKER_03]: marks, purple Urkel that we got from the
club.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some purple strain that you can
clearly when I, I don't know how many
[SPEAKER_03]: times I'll be thumbing through pictures
and this guy will say, yeah, this is my
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, that's not even close to
purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's just, I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just drives me.
[SPEAKER_03]: To, to produce some seed that is going to
show people what the purple Urkel is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is truly all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and the PJ is that's, that's where
we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do, um, F two lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do, uh, some hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but for me, which is the most
important factor is I'm, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it full circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm going to draw the Urkel out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and it'll be cubed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be a 75% or higher, um,
Urkel dominant in every female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or I won't be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is definitely our goal with,
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there'll be other projects that we do
with it, but the goal with the PJ is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is to allow people to experience true,
uh, in every way, purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, because like I said, I see people who,
you know, they, they really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they, they invest a lot of their
time and money and, and, and they've,
[SPEAKER_03]: they've, they've been shamed and you'll
see their pictures and they're so excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, I'm, I'm not going to
be the one that breaks their heart and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and just pulls the dick move and tells
them, dude, you're not, you're not growing
[SPEAKER_03]: purple Urkel bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're growing,
but it's not Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not, I'm not going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it does, it pisses me off to see
that because it just tells me how many
[SPEAKER_03]: people are out there that are just doing
it to turn a dime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, you know, it bothers me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't what it's about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything, especially in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look around, everything is about
the almighty dollar again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And money's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Money's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I wish I had more of it, but that's,
that's not what it's about for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's about producing the best
cannabis that I can possibly produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and putting smile on a smile's on
growers faces.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to repeat our name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to tell their friends,
have you grown any of this guy's stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well then look, I'm going to get you a
pack because that's how, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's how strongly I feel about,
about his lines is, is there, they are
[SPEAKER_03]: what they say they are when he gives you
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: On, um, you know, uh, the packaging or
whatever, when he tells you this is what
[SPEAKER_03]: you can expect, that's what you can
expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the, you know, it's, it, like I said,
it just pisses me off to see so many
[SPEAKER_03]: people that think they're growing the
actual Urkel cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's not, and we're going to
cube the PJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we're going to bring out the Urkel and
that's, oh God, that's the best thing
[SPEAKER_03]: about her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is from the get-go, just the, the initial
females that we were running from the
[SPEAKER_03]: initial cross of the, uh, the Urkel and
the purple Jackie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're already seeing extremely
Urkel Dom Fino's regularly without even
[SPEAKER_03]: trying, um, just the expressions and it's
exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really exciting to see, you know,
something coming to fruition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't, once I get to that,
that fourth, um, cross, I can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what we're going to see,
I, I don't even expect it to have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: cubed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't think it will have to go that
far.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I truly think, um, you know,
we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll search our
[SPEAKER_03]: initial F ones, um, for the brother and
sister that represents it well enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then our back cross, uh,
with our Urkel, the selection process,
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe by the third time through,
uh, you're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see full Urkel dominance
in the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, uh, you know, not that we won't
take it to the, to the fourth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say that at this point,
but, um, I'm absolutely 100% positive what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to see from, from the PJ,
uh, hybrid, the PJ Urkel hybrids is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be very, very, very Urkel, very Urkel
dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that's the goal that,
you know, that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as far as the, do I grow synthetic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I grow organic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to, um, we do use synthetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my, my personal head stash is organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I do believe in a very clean,
uh, pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I want nothing but white ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I don't want any, you know,
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want any bullshit in my pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for one, I do have lupus and I have to
be very specific in what I intake,
[SPEAKER_03]: ingest, um, breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, my head stash is organic,
but to be fair to the growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to grow in with synthetics as well,
because you're still over half of your
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, you know, uh, are using synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd be amazed at how many people I
still come across that, that will come up
[SPEAKER_03]: and send me an email or a message.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll say, Hey, you know,
my plants doing this and, and I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: why I'm only four weeks in the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first question I ask is,
okay, well, tell me a little bit about
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their first thing they'll say is,
well, you know, um, my miracle grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just, it, I'm feeding it as the bottle
label.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm real, are you fucking with me?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't be an ass about it because
these, you know, these growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're, they're, they're really,
they're trying, they're committed and they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know any better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this day and age, I'm surprised with,
uh, with the way everybody knows Monsanto
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have people that are still growing
with the bullshit and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I do, I have to use synthetics and I
have to, uh, I guess I shouldn't say I
[SPEAKER_03]: have to, um, but in my brain, the way my
brain works, uh, to be fair to everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and to, to give them a product that
I'm, I'm confident in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I have to grow synthetically and I have
to be able to say, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: how they're going to perform with
synthetics, with organics, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors, indoors, light depth greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, it's, it's just,
if, if your goal is to produce the best
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, uh, you know, be confident in
it, that's that, that, that's all part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, in terms of your strains,
you use a really good descriptive and
[SPEAKER_01]: categorical way of describing them to
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you list things such as the
number of phenotypes and what to expect
[SPEAKER_01]: from each phenotype, as well as,
you know, your standard flowering times
[SPEAKER_01]: and rough stretch values and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there are a few other breeders who use
this same general layer and it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this type of information is,
it's not only like just a service to the
[SPEAKER_01]: customer by giving them more information,
but it's also almost mandatory these days
[SPEAKER_01]: because in a way you're showing people
that you've grown out the seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've, you've taken note of all these
traits because something which seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up more and more is like this idea of
like, you know, I don't know if I should
[SPEAKER_01]: call them breeders, but you know,
quote breeders who make seeds and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't even test them and they're just
like straight to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in a way you're indicating that
like, nah, that's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I've done the testing,
I've done what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in your opinion, is it not so much that
it's, it's more just like for the
[SPEAKER_01]: customer's benefit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's totally for the customer's
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I want to know, uh, you know,
because a lot of people, they don't have,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, 5,000 square feet of space
to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, most growers have a tent, most growers
have a corner in a bedroom, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: or crawl space in an attic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you've got growers that have five foot
ceilings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so you need to be able to tell
them this is not the strain for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only way that you can do that is
by having grown the lines yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it pisses me off to no end to see
these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, again, I don't do the whole,
I'm going to call this guy out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, it's usually it's, it's the
bigger outfit that, uh, they run the
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: They process their seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they cure them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in the package and they're out to
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no testing, you know, where's,
where's your viability rates?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, what, what percent of the
parent line lines are going to show,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, what's your male to female ratio?
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they'll, they'll make some shit
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll put some wording on a package
because it looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact of the matter is they're not
testing their own products out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I think it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, it's, it irks me tremendously
because again, it comes back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: almighty dollar and the quicker you can
get product to market, the quicker you're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting a paycheck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll go broke and poor doing what I
love, um, making sure that the customer
[SPEAKER_03]: knows exactly what they're growing,
uh, before I ever do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I've been doing this for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't changed my ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've not gotten close to being rich
financially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've gotten rich in other ways,
uh, that most people will never get to
[SPEAKER_03]: experience in their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to share it with my, with my
daughter and my wonderful wife of 16
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that wealth to me is more
important than any wealth I can put into
[SPEAKER_03]: my wallet or my bank account.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want the growers to feel confident
in the strains that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, and of course there's going
to be exceptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have recessive traits that
show up, um, from lineage way,
[SPEAKER_03]: way, way gone by.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's always going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always have, uh, the growers that are
like, Hey, you know, this plant was
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to stay short and squat,
but it grew a single cola.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when I topped it and it was wanting
to grow eight and nine feet in my little
[SPEAKER_03]: space, it's, it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way around it, but I want that
to happen as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only way I can assure myself,
um, of, of that happening is growing out
[SPEAKER_03]: my own product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it's a slow tedious task,
but anything we create is tested,
[SPEAKER_03]: is tested thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we, I, I want to know what it's going
to do in a small space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I want to be able to tell the grower,
you know, um, if you're growing with this
[SPEAKER_03]: style, uh, maybe some LST, it works great
in the sea of green or in a screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the only way to do that is by you
actually doing it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I, I, it's, it's a constant
testing, um, process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of times that I'm
growing, uh, strains that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that aren't specifically for what I was
looking for for my personal use,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm growing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I feel as it's probably going to kind
of, kind of sound lame, but I'm growing it
[SPEAKER_03]: for other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not in a sense that I, I'm providing
to the dispensary, I'm growing so I can
[SPEAKER_03]: tell people what they can expect from this
line or from this line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I want to be able to make
recommendations when, when somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: approaches me and asks me, okay,
this is my circumstance.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I'm using.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, this is everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and this is what I'm looking for in my
pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be able to tell them this one,
this one, or this one will be right up
[SPEAKER_03]: your alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, this is going to be what you want
for your space for the way you are
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, you, you, you don't want to have an,
uh, you know, a less experienced grower
[SPEAKER_03]: have to change the, their comfortability
in growing to suit a plant that it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be such a pain in the ass that it's
going to turn them off for growing for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want them to experience
headaches and hassles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want them to be able to, to,
to grow in, in their realm and in their,
[SPEAKER_03]: their comfortability factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you want to, you want to keep it in
there, you know, and that's the goal is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is you can, you can produce strains that,
you know, that are potent, that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that are very tasty, that yield or,
or the specifics that individual growers
[SPEAKER_03]: are looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can produce strains that, um,
fill the needs of growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and it, you know, and them not
have to adapt to a single plant each time
[SPEAKER_03]: they want to change and grow something
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people don't have confidence
in seeds because it's a crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people prefer to grow,
uh, cuts, uh, because again, growing from
[SPEAKER_03]: seed can be a crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they like to stay with cuts,
which, like I said, you bring in cuts from
[SPEAKER_03]: a dispensary and it has its own different
set of, of headaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the powdery mildew issues,
uh, you know, any kind of fungus or
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really, you know, not all,
I don't want to lump everybody into a big
[SPEAKER_03]: circle, but a lot of dispensaries,
you know, they don't, they don't take the
[SPEAKER_03]: time to do what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cuts, they get them in as fast as they
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get them rooted as fast as they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're getting them out the door as
fast as they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're there as a business.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not there to suit the needs,
even though that's what they want you to
[SPEAKER_03]: believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, uh, the person who is sick
that is growing their, their medication,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, and, and trust me,
I know a lot of people that I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I do help that they grow pot because they
are sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not growing pot to be stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm open for everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you want to smoke weed because
you want to, you know, that's your form of
[SPEAKER_03]: relaxation and then it's like,
you know, cracking a cold one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm totally fine with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, that was me before I got sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I still consider myself a stoner,
uh, for other reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but most of it now is, is for proper
medic, medicating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you just don't want, they're
already dealing with the hassle of life
[SPEAKER_03]: with the circumstances that they're under.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want them to have to deal with
issues from plants and growing from
[SPEAKER_03]: clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it has its own hassle.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people, they get spider mites that
are resistant to, to organic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what are they left to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's nuclear, it's, it's nuclear
war time because if you want to keep the
[SPEAKER_03]: cut or now get your grow room back because
you brought in some shy C cuts from such
[SPEAKER_03]: and such this book, it's the only way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, and I, it just bothers me
because I know this industry could be so
[SPEAKER_03]: much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be so much more compassion in
it and it all revolves around the damn
[SPEAKER_03]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, it's bothersome to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we do it different.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we always have done it
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always will do it different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's, I just, I, I just want a
person to know when they're getting our
[SPEAKER_03]: label, they're getting those 10 seeds,
their germination rates are going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: high and it's going to do what they expect
it to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only way it's going to happen is
if you yourself are growing them out and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying, oh yeah, we, we tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tested five of those strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tested five.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you yourself didn't even test the whole
pack of something you created that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: now selling to the masses.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we tested 105, you know, I mean,
we went through 15 packs of 10 to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure the consistency was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how many times did we see a
recessive female?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times did we see the targeted
female?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times did we see, you know,
the exact one?
[SPEAKER_03]: That everybody is after.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you document, you document,
you test, you grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's, that's called knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's called knowing your
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing I am very proud of.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife and I, um, I, I feel that we set
ourselves apart from everybody else
[SPEAKER_03]: because though we're not, you know,
trying to work with a hundred different
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, we're working with a base and I'm
working with that base because I know that
[SPEAKER_03]: base better than anybody knows their base
because I've been working with these for
[SPEAKER_03]: years, not for months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't just bring in the cookies and now
I'm working with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm releasing it to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working with my lines for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm creating hybrids from my lines and
I've been working with them for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm selecting specific traits to work
into, um, hybrid form because I know what
[SPEAKER_03]: those said traits are going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: In hybrid form, one grown out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a direct reflection on
who we are and what we want for the
[SPEAKER_03]: growing community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, that's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, moving to a bit more of like a
macro topic for a breeder, what's it like
[SPEAKER_01]: for you as kind of, you know, like,
I hope not to offend you with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as kind of a more smaller breeder,
um, what's it like to interact with the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed banks?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like your gear is out there,
but it's not like on Attitude or Seedsman,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, like those ultra big name
seed banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you not want to be on there or do you
think, oh, it's a bit hard to get noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: by them at times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think like, no, I've got,
you know, kind of like a niche I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to fill and I feel like I'm kind of doing
that at the moment and I don't need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a part of any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God, that's such a large question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, first, um, I love being known as
the, a true mom and pop, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cause that's how I see us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, again, for us, it's, it's not about
the bulk, the mass of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the refined, uh, search,
um, product knowledge, um, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so to coin the term mom and pop,
it, it suits us fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, we don't mind being a smaller,
uh, well, we'll say smaller known size
[SPEAKER_03]: wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say we're small when it comes
to the space, but size wise and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, how we're known.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are, we are a definite mom and pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, now as far as the notoriety factor,
um, and being on, uh, the attitude,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, uh, we've attempted to go that route.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been approached time and time again
by the, the big seed outfits and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, both times that we, we thought we were
going in those directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did everything we could to stay on the
down low, um, to, to, to get the seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: into the hands of, uh, the bigger,
uh, we'll say UK guys that are going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the distribution or the space fame,
uh, the Spanish, uh, seed outfits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and both times, um, I've lost,
um, I've lost quite a bit, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, uh, has taught me a lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for instance, with one of them that's
now defunct, um, I lost 90 packs of,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, one of our, of our lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because I put trust in the people
because I'm, I'm a trusted trusting person
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know when I tell somebody
something, they can trust it 100.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I oftentimes believe that the same
with the person that I'm dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And oftentimes it's not, um, and I've had
to learn that lesson the hard way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, we've done it and like I said,
I've been taken and it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's not about, uh, the finances.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's the, it's about just the
idea that you were just used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so right now we, we've kind of
moved far enough away that it's not fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: in my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, we are open to, to, you know,
to giving an, uh, another try,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there, there will have to be,
uh, stipulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's, there's only,
one way that we're going to do it now,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we've had to learn the lessons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you, like I said, you put trust
into people and it's all lies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you end up finding out later on
that it was a big pyramid scheme and
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody is making a shit ton of money off
the backs of people that are doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: real work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it's, you know, that's not kosher
with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it would be very nice to get,
to get on with, uh, with the right crew,
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody that's going to appreciate us the
way we'll appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You provide me a service and I'm going to
go even further out of my way to make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: you're happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's how we work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we've always been.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we'll provide our own freebies that
you can give out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of things that we,
we go above and beyond with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's just that fear factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of, you know, um, of, of dealing with an
asshole who's just out to screw you in the
[SPEAKER_03]: end.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the reason behind that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that we don't want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not that it's, that's not the
ultimate goal because absolutely that is,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for the last 10 years,
it wasn't, my wife wasn't real keen on the
[SPEAKER_03]: idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for one, um, we didn't want to jump
into that pool and, and worry about,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, is somebody coming for us all
the time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and once we moved out of that and the
fear had subsided and, and then it was
[SPEAKER_03]: the, now we've gotten screwed by an
asshole that was in this for the wrong
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're kind of getting over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ideas is appealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, um, we're ready to expand the
horizon for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're ready to make the label,
um, more known.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the goal, um, is I,
I myself, I'm ready to, to put myself out
[SPEAKER_03]: there a little bit more because my
daughter is, uh, she's getting older.
[SPEAKER_03]: She needs to go to college in two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a honor student, straight A's never
gotten anything less than straight A's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something else I take great pride
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, she's in all, um, uh, AP classes,
which in the States are, um, college,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, uh, college basically, uh,
pre college.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, my wife and I,
that's our pride and joy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, she wants to go to Humboldt state
and it's going to cost mom and dad about
[SPEAKER_03]: 75 K, uh, a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to fulfill, uh, I want to
fulfill that for my daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I, I, I want her to get,
uh, her degree and, uh, my plan is for her
[SPEAKER_03]: to come back and run, run the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's really not interested in that at
this point in time, but Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's always that chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if she's wanting to go to
Humboldt state, that's a great start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next question would be,
um, what would be your advice to someone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's trying to become a Breedy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe they've been doing their
own thing as a bit of an amateur for
[SPEAKER_01]: awhile, but they're ready to try to,
you know, step it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your advice?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one thing I've heard is,
you know, you really need to get a social
[SPEAKER_01]: media presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think are some things people
need to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends on, uh, what,
what aspects you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my biggest advice is, is somebody
who's wanting to, to truly get into it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is, uh, and know what you're doing,
obviously, but know your lines you're
[SPEAKER_03]: working with, know your product,
the ins and outs of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, be confident in what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then once you, you feel confident
in, in your product, um, then yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: then, and if you're willing and that's
what you want to do, put yourself out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, go to, uh, like here in Cali,
we have the Emerald cup, um, do meet and
[SPEAKER_03]: greets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we just, uh, we just did one in the
Bay area, San Fran.
[SPEAKER_03]: We announced, um, Hey, you know,
come meet with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ended up on the beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cold as hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but great, great people, great times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, just put yourself out there
and, and smile, be friendly, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: be a good person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and, and the rest will follow,
you know, just it's, it's, it's not so
[SPEAKER_03]: much about the notoriety as it is about
your personality and who you are and how
[SPEAKER_03]: you treat people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause if you do it right, people are going
to like you and, and, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: do the advertising for you and,
you know, that just, just be good to the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that, that are, um, obviously being
good and supporting you and, and just be
[SPEAKER_03]: who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, don't be a tight ass,
you know, give, give, give, give,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, like us, we probably still
give away, oh, maybe not so much now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a point in time when we were
giving away two or three times more seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: than, than we were selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but if you're dependent upon the
income, that can be a bit of a struggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're paying for all the
postage of everything going out and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, and, and you're, you're
covering all the expense, then it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you know, it, it can be a,
it can, it can, it can cost you a bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, just go to events, socialize,
make it clear what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, be able to have, uh, full on
conversations where you can be asked any
[SPEAKER_03]: question and, and you know, the answer,
um, know the ins and outs of what,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, your product is, um, and, and be,
be passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't get in it for the wrong
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it because you think you're going
to get rich and famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wrong to think, you know,
you, you do it for the love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you, you, you know, you do it because
that's, that's what you love doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, on that same kind of idea,
I've often heard people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, kind of tote this idea of like,
oh man, it would be so good to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've literally heard this quote,
like, I would just smoke weed and look
[SPEAKER_01]: after plants all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, is that like this idealistic
description?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from what I've seen, breeders seem to
work like the longest hours of anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, you want to give us a true
picture of what it's like to be a breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a day in the life of?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so not like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, do I smoke a lot of weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, do I get to smoke as much as I want?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm too busy doing other shit to get
to constantly stop and medicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, let's say you don't have
scheduled days off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, things are going to come up that you
wouldn't ever expect in a million years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, your workload is always going to be
greater than expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, uh, anytime you make plans,
you might as well cancel them in advance
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not going to take place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, your, your days,
um, they start when they start and they
[SPEAKER_03]: end when they end.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, I'm working nine to five
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go in at nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, you know, might be home by five 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're done when your, your task is
done and get used to late nights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not talking 10 or 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking three or four in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we didn't get to sleep last night
because obviously a plant works,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, cause we've got plants on different,
different cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are in the dark in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are, uh, in the dark at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's, it's a constant remembering
who's where and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: get used to, to working on two or three
hours of sleep or, or doubling up and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and, and, and not having sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, this time of the year,
because it's a harvest season,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, get really used to, to being on
basically on call because it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, uh, it's not the lifestyle that
people think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we actually don't get to go to,
uh, as many harvest festivals or
[SPEAKER_03]: competitions, uh, that we would like to,
or get to do things with the growers out
[SPEAKER_03]: there that we would love to get to do
because we're working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, you know, just to get the,
to do the meet and greet that we did last
[SPEAKER_03]: weekend, it took us a month of
coordinating and planning and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, and, and, you know, I've got a
really good friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God was able to, to get all of our,
our spot arranged and, and helped me get
[SPEAKER_03]: the directions and, and the times and
everything out there because it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, there's, there's no eight
hour days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to have a five day a
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could do what I do and have it be a
five day a week, 40 hours a week type of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my, it would be heavenly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's not the, uh, the, the glamour
and the glory that, that people tend to
[SPEAKER_03]: think that it is, especially if you're,
if you're committed to it, it's
[SPEAKER_03]: transplants, it's watering, it's feeding,
it's, uh, you know, and then if,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said, running synthetic nutrients,
you're constantly adjusting and checking
[SPEAKER_03]: pHs and, um, how much it's sterilization
of containers and drip trays and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and cleaning of hoods and, and,
uh, it's, I can, I can write a book on the
[SPEAKER_03]: workload of, of the list of things that,
that have to be done and socialite.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is none, not for, not for true
readers, you know, and, and we're not like
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the bigger outfits that have a
crew that, that they are able to pay to
[SPEAKER_03]: do, to do the, the grant work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's my wife and I, we do the
grant work, you know, and then I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have it any other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't a complaint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, uh, it does wear on my body
because like I said, I do, I do have
[SPEAKER_03]: lupus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, sometimes it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've had 13 surgeries, um,
due to my disease and, and sometimes it,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, uh, it can be overpowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, uh, and like I said, my wife is
the most amazing person I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, she's probably the hardest worker I've
ever known.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, she's able to do things that
I still to this day, I still get blown
[SPEAKER_03]: away by what she's able to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, she's one of the best growers that I
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, I'm just very thankful to
have a partner in life and a partner in
[SPEAKER_03]: the business that I have or else this
wouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I, I'll never complain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll, you'll never not see me smiling or
joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even when I have a hospital visit due
to my disease, I'm tracking up with the
[SPEAKER_03]: doctor and the nurses, uh, just because
that's, that's just kind of to use a more
[SPEAKER_03]: modern term.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you're saying, um,
if you just want to smoke weed all day and
[SPEAKER_01]: not do a bunch of hard work, it should
probably be a rapper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the life that you need to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, in the recent kind of six months
or so we've seen a lot of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably been a bit longer than that,
but particularly online, we've seen like
[SPEAKER_01]: this rise in crowd mentality around
strange, you know, the big one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the big blue dream hate wagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you know, as a little side
note, I always have to remind people like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like blue dream, like it did so much for
so many people, like how, like it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: all disregarded in this whole argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, um, so with that being said
though, like, how do you feel about the
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd mentality?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you kind of alluded to it
earlier, you know, like as much as blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream gets a negative rap, cookies gets a
positive rap and GG four gets a positive
[SPEAKER_01]: rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, does it, does that sit okay
with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if regardless, you know, do you not
feel like maybe in a few years time,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll see this big, you know, the same
hate that's getting on blue dream,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's going to be on girls get
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be some new thing,
which everyone's all over at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just a perpetually changing
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, the, the one aspect where we'll
just take cookies, for instance,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one aspect about cookies that blue
dream didn't have, um, well is the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've got, uh, the rapping community
that you've got burner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, it's got a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you now have, uh, the cookies fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who they've got an entire clothing line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, it's a complete lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that one, I see, uh, carrying,
um, carrying itself longer term,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you will, uh, then say the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the hype with the blue dream was
because it was an amazing strain of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis that they might talk shit about
now, but you know, two years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's all anybody was smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all anybody wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all anybody was growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it didn't have that whole
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cookies has done something I never
would have imagined in, in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: community with the, all the choices that
people have and, and everything you it's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of, uh, like I said, it's a
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's influenced its own industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's just, uh, it all off of a one
started out as one pot strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that I'd never have seen anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as that one, how will that one
carry a year or two years from now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I see, uh, the GG four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I see that one fading as, you know,
maybe the blue dream did, I don't even
[SPEAKER_03]: know if that one will, will carry as long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as, as the blue dream did for one GG
four and the outdoor scene here,
[SPEAKER_03]: she's not the yielder that the blue dream
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the blue dream from the
grow aspect, you could get, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, done right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get primo pot, um, and yields
that set records in six, seven pounds off
[SPEAKER_03]: of outdoor, outdoor plants of,
um, you know, lower a grade for outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, uh, you consider the scale on
just outdoor, it's an a grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but even the dispensaries in the
Midwest that are bringing in outdoor Cali
[SPEAKER_03]: weed and trying to pass it as,
as indoor, it would be a high,
[SPEAKER_03]: high B a low a.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, that was one of the reasons that
blue dream had the, the, the weight that
[SPEAKER_03]: she had because she was an all around
strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a growers dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a toker stream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, she was a dispensary stream
because everybody had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it's, it's, it's like with a
particular type of, of food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, once everybody has had it and then
that's so popular, that's all you can
[SPEAKER_03]: find.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes a burden and then nobody wants
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it tanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of where, um, you know,
the blue dream went.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of see that with a,
the GG four, she'll, she'll burn herself
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's not me knocking these streams.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just me saying that's how society
works when it comes to these strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and people want a variety,
you know, people want, uh, in the morning,
[SPEAKER_03]: they feel like maybe having, uh,
something that's a bit of a earth being
[SPEAKER_03]: in, uh, say coffee like, um, you know,
with, with their breakfast or with their,
[SPEAKER_03]: with their, their coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the evening, they want something
fruity, you know, so there's, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, there's, I see it
being, being more like that, but again,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I'm just not big on the whole,
uh, the, this, the strain name game in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cut of the month.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you look at Sherbert and,
uh, cherry pie and they're all great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're all really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but just to, to gain the notoriety
that they do and to have people do the
[SPEAKER_03]: things that you do to try and acquire it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's kind of crazy, you know,
but I, I, I see it, uh, you'll have
[SPEAKER_03]: something else that comes out that takes
its place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how it's worked and it's,
it, you know, it's a cycle and then they
[SPEAKER_03]: always cycle in and they will always cycle
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, the, like I said, the one I,
I, I don't know what to expect of is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because it's got its own,
it's a, it's got its own following and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and its own lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like, I guess I've been,
I, I've been checked by the whole cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't you working with cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't you, you know, making any
cookie hybrids?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a personal choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for one, I've never grown,
uh, cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never grown the forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've never grown any of the cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now my brother, my brother's grown
probably every cookie that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my brother likes to play the strain
game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he loves that, um, because that's what
we'll see his clientele.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they demand of him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, he's, that's kind of his
business is, is taking care of what they
[SPEAKER_03]: want, what, what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't like cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't like no other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's what he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm polar opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you have that more kind of
organic artistic approach where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where it's like, it flows from
me and it's not, I don't want it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: influenced or like commissioned or anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of, um, a little left field of
what we were just talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is a breeder who you would want to do
a collaboration with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if there isn't any,
or maybe just as a follow-up, who's
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who maybe look up to is not the
right word, but you know, who's someone
[SPEAKER_01]: where as a breeder who's currently around,
you look at their work and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, man, like you're doing the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everything you're doing, I completely
agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for me, there's only one name that
truly stands out that, um, and I hate to
[SPEAKER_03]: say, but I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because he's become so in demand that,
and he's done so well at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's even kind of changing his,
his attitude towards things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the attitude is the proper
term, but it's, it's kind of changing the
[SPEAKER_03]: way he views things a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's kind of changing the type
of person that he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I don't want that
to sound like I'm, I'm Dick and him that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm not whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he's, he's, he's just one of the,
the best people that you will ever meet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's just a really down to earth,
sensible, understanding, um, committed
[SPEAKER_03]: guy, uh, is Bodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Bodie is a hell of a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew you were going to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's, uh, he's in it for the right
reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's committed to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done his work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he's an artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, um, he's passionate and, um,
he has a keen understanding, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as an eye for what he's looking
for and what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, uh, the guy has a master and,
um, he is, uh, you know, he's well known
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, it, that doesn't, uh,
doesn't really affect him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's so well known now that maybe
it's, it's starting to kind of alter it a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit, you know, like I was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think again, this isn't a negative,
uh, response at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I love the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I, and I, I, I hope to God,
if, if I were to, um, to become as
[SPEAKER_03]: successful as he is, that it, it wouldn't
change me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, uh, it's something I think gets
out of our hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we can necessarily control
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a, a product of the
environment that, that you are now in
[SPEAKER_03]: because your life will probably change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, everybody's wanting your
time and, and, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that you can't help,
but, but that's changing you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I kind of think that's what,
uh, is, is kind of taking place a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit with Bodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but as far as who he is, and what he
stands for, he's the best guy in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He couldn't ask for a better person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's a kind soul.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he gives, he's another one that gives
as many, um, as he sees as he sells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, not just that,
but even in the, the, the, the flower he,
[SPEAKER_03]: he, he gives there, he's, uh, he's,
he's committed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I've never heard him say a bad
thing about anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's never going to be one that talks
shit about anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and to what you, you have to,
uh, to really, really, um, like about
[SPEAKER_03]: Bodie is there's so many people that are
now making a name off of his work.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the work that he's put in that he
himself has busted his ass and spent so
[SPEAKER_03]: many years dedicated to you now have
people that are using that and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and not having done any of the damn leg
work themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're now using that and they're,
they're becoming really successful with it
[SPEAKER_03]: because Bodie himself and, and his
creations are so popular that the,
[SPEAKER_03]: that, and that's only going to change on
that end of the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the buyers, they're going to have to
be supportive of their, of their favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: reader and they're going to have to say,
wait a minute, I'm going to boycott this
[SPEAKER_03]: guy because you're making the name from
somebody else's work and somebody else's
[SPEAKER_03]: name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not cool with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they don't have a problem and
in, in most cases at Bodie, he himself has
[SPEAKER_03]: no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have a problem with it per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but in many instances I do,
because you got some, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: dumb ass that's never done anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just happened in two years to get
extremely lucky and, and put together,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, a couple of, of Finos that he found
out of somebody else's hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's kind of now made himself into
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it bothers me because I'm one of
those guys that have put in years,
[SPEAKER_03]: not, not one or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've put in years of my life into this and
I, uh, you know, I've, should I've
[SPEAKER_03]: probably grown more plants in,
in five years than most people will grow
[SPEAKER_03]: in a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you figure I've been doing this
for, it feels like forever to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put in a lot of work and,
and it's not that I don't care if people
[SPEAKER_03]: use anything that they use, that they,
that they get of mine to do whatever they
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm absolutely fine with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it comes time to now you're going
to start using it to, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: create your own label and your own name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're profiting off of the work
that, uh, you know, people like Bodhi have
[SPEAKER_03]: put into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because it's a commitment by,
again, we'll use Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's a commitment by Bodhi that you're
able to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, yeah, we live in a
capitalistic capitalistic society and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the name of the game, but that
doesn't make it morally right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, you know, that's,
that's where I'm bothered by it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's the guy that, that,
uh, um, I do, I look up to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, I, I just, Bodhi and I
are similar in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's passionate about his work and,
uh, that's, that's, that's how I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bodhi would never say anything bad nor
would Bodhi ever come out and tell people,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, don't use my work to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take the growers out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That are committed to this and that are
passionate to not support those that are
[SPEAKER_03]: only making, uh, money, you know,
profits off of somebody else's hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, is these guys are
willing to do it and they're willing to
[SPEAKER_03]: low ball, you know, and, and, and just so
they can turn a profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and that's what ends up happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, you know, Bodhi already
tries to be compassionate and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and, and put his overhead,
you know, into everything and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and his bottom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just, he's one of those guys that's
never going to say anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and he's put in years of,
of hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and though it is a love and a passion
for him, I just don't like to see things
[SPEAKER_03]: like that happen for, for those that,
uh, that I admire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think so highly of, and,
and a lot of people are doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing that with, with his work
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sad to see that, you know,
like, I think it's like one out of every
[SPEAKER_01]: three breeders or something, you know,
when you see their genetics, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one parent's, the Bodhi strain,
the, uh, the others, like a top dog or a
[SPEAKER_01]: TGA strain, you know, like that's their
whole menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and as you said, you know,
Bodhi is such a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Bodhi, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he'd never say, anything, you know,
and just for everyone listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, we have actually been talking to him
and we do have an episode coming up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: not too distant future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's totally one of the nicest dudes
you'll ever meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think you could get him to say
a bad word about anyone, as you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this may be kind of brings us to
our last question, but maybe the most
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting one, in my opinion,
for someone like you, who's got such a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a depth of history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to me it's kind of this, I often
compare it to cooking in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like you'll get these smells or
these flavors and they'll, and it'll take
[SPEAKER_01]: you back, you know, like they're,
they're attached to the memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so for someone like you,
who's got such a depth of memory,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you must have all these
different flavors that can take you back
[SPEAKER_01]: to these different points in time and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I love to always ask is what's
the most stand out to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like was there a flavor profile
or a terpene profile that maybe isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really around any more or something which
was just really, you know, so for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I read about the Clementine,
you know, how, you know, it's essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: an Afghani male with that tangerine smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and that's really unique,
you know, like that, that would have blown
[SPEAKER_01]: my mind back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like what, what was the
standout for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's, it's always been,
uh, the citrus expressions and it's more
[SPEAKER_03]: common now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but when we were creating,
um, and mind you, selection is key and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then selecting, you can find that Fino
that you now have and it's, it's amazing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it doesn't mean that it's,
it's going to pass on into the progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, that you, you know, you hope for it,
but there's no way, uh, maybe in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future we'll have tests that, that can
determine how DNA is going to pass and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and who's going to be the dominant parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, um, it's, it's not that,
uh, uh, yeah, I think I can pick up a
[SPEAKER_03]: citrus in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the sweet, sweet presence of
tangerine.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you close your eyes and you break the
butt open, or you walk into one of our
[SPEAKER_03]: rooms or one of the, the outdoor patches
and you close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you take in a deep breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can almost envision yourself standing
in an orange orchard and just being amazed
[SPEAKER_03]: that when you open your eyes, it's
cannabis that that, and then the,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, well, actually there is another one
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and though you can, you can still
pick it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like sometimes heavily in our,
in our, uh, in our Clementine,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially our, our, our lavender
Clementine crosses, you can pick it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, one of the things my dad was
known for was his skunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the most pungent, I just got sprayed
in the face by a skunk, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: dirt profile that you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when, like, uh, I think it was my
brother and I that were just talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, dad's skunks were so rich,
so full, so complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, uh, it was like being sprayed in
the face with the skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we might've been the only,
the only kids, uh, at the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, if we were, you know, riding around
and we'd come across a fresh roadkill of a
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk where everybody else is covering
their face going, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother and I like, I love that smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's looking at us like,
that's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to congratulate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've unlocked the bonus question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason why I asked that was because
I was digging around on some forums on
[SPEAKER_01]: the, specifically the breed bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found a comment years and years ago,
and someone essentially asked you what I
[SPEAKER_01]: just asked you, you know, like,
what's, what's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and your answer was I'm still
loyal to the skunk family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me those nose burning, eye watering
funk of the skunk and I'll fill my lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's further than capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was a great comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bonus question is, where's all
the skunk crosses?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, skunk it's, uh, it's almost just
been so diluted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, uh, that heavy that, uh,
true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does to your eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What onions will do is really hard to
find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and a lot of the stuff that,
that dad was growing back then,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, we still have, have seeds
of, but the germination, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking seeds from the,
the late seventies, early eighties,
[SPEAKER_03]: the viability of them is, you know,
10, 20% and then finding them,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, in the selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the, it's, it's, uh, so heavy in work
that it's, it's damn near impossible to
[SPEAKER_03]: spend the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of my goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it probably should have been my first
goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, as a tribute to my father.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I just, I just, I, I didn't,
because I just felt that the, the work
[SPEAKER_03]: involved and the purpose of what I was
doing were at that time or, or just,
[SPEAKER_03]: they, they were too far apart to make it a
viable option.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that it's, it's there, it can be
found, but the gene pool has become so
[SPEAKER_03]: muddled.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the expressions that's,
you know, the hardest to find is the true
[SPEAKER_03]: roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is now, uh, one of the most highly
sought after and it is one of the most,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, difficult, uh, expressions to,
to, to be able to, to find in plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my goals is to someday to find
the classic roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and like I said, my, my father was
responsible for, for some patches that you
[SPEAKER_03]: could, if you were in a certain part of
the, of the valley and if the wind was
[SPEAKER_03]: just right, you could literally be a mile
or two miles away and you could smell
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was always the biggest influence
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I grew up loving that smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I don't, I, I hope people don't judge
me for what I'm about to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought about it and I'm going to go
ahead and say it, but the first experience
[SPEAKER_03]: that I had ever puffing on a joint was
actually, uh, a non lit joint that,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, my dad was, my dad was, uh,
so happy about, um, that he looked at me,
[SPEAKER_03]: turned away and was explaining it to me,
the profile and, and the natural oil of it
[SPEAKER_03]: and why it smelled the way it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, and why are, uh,
our old factory picks it up the way it
[SPEAKER_03]: does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And understands it the way it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he looked at me again and he goes,
here dry hit this, just don't tell your
[SPEAKER_03]: mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put it to my lips and I did,
and it was, it was an experience I'll take
[SPEAKER_03]: to my grave.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I was, um, nine, nine years
old, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I kind of tears him up a little
bit, but, uh, I, I did it and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, it, uh, to this day, I've not been
able to experience that, um, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was his prized skunk and,
um, it just was, uh, yeah, it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even just talking about it now,
it flashes the memory so vividly in my
[SPEAKER_03]: mind and even the smell, the smell,
the smell was the taste was so strong and
[SPEAKER_03]: so inherit into the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could smell it as I was tasting it
almost as if my senses were all working
[SPEAKER_03]: together and my dad was trying to explain
that to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I was so proud that they just
like, my dad just shared a dry it with me
[SPEAKER_03]: and it just was an amazing moment in my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my dad passed away when he was 58.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't get to experience,
uh, you know, a lot of the things that I
[SPEAKER_03]: had planned on as, as he grew older and
sharing the things that I, that I would
[SPEAKER_03]: have loved to share with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's that skunk it's dad's eye
watering nose tickling, uh, throat
[SPEAKER_03]: tingling skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, to this day, that's, that's my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that one that, you know, I mean,
you know, before it comes out of the bag,
[SPEAKER_03]: when it is, you know, if your buddy's
bringing it over before he comes into the
[SPEAKER_03]: house, when he's got, um, it's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that was the experience that,
uh, that comes back to my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, you know, I'd been around it my
whole life, but that was the first time
[SPEAKER_03]: that my dad knew anyway, that I had
experienced, uh, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the dry hit and the fact that it got to be
with my dad was, uh, it's a moment of
[SPEAKER_03]: federal that I'll cherish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll cherish it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that brings us to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, was there any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to make quick shout out to
a mutual friend, Gerald, for, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: lining this interview up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy is, is one of the most sincere
guys that I've talked with online.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just a, such a great guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So upbeat and, uh, yeah, I, obviously I
don't personally know him, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, yeah, I, I, yeah, I would like to
thank him as well for, for getting this
[SPEAKER_03]: put together because, um, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, this is, this has been a,
a real fun experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I've never done anything like
this before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, and I was nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I was pretty nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, your interview has been,
uh, just so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, from the very first question,
uh, that you asked, I just kind of sat
[SPEAKER_03]: back in the chair and I was like,
dude, this is going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's made this really, really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, thank him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would, there's, um, uh, there's two
guys that I, that I would, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: one is just kind of a newer buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes by the name of Dr. Get Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he listens to this, he'll know
who he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell of a guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's just one of those guys that you
don't find.
[SPEAKER_03]: And him and I have quickly become friends
that I've adopted into my, into my circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, uh, the, the other one,
um, actually there is, there's,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's, there's two more is my wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, she's, she's the most special person
that I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she makes me a better person.
[SPEAKER_03]: She makes me the person that I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my brother smelling mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the guy is one of the most,
uh, funny people you ever meet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do anything for anybody and I love
them to death.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those, those, those are my,
those are my two right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks so much for taking the time
to sit down with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I personally think that everyone
should be keeping their eyes out for the
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the purple Jackie cube project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it sounds like it's going to be a
game changer for especially purple seed
[SPEAKER_01]: game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you already do that, but you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be, uh, we're, we're hoping to
finish testing and, and have it out
[SPEAKER_03]: around, uh, around February and Hey,
you're an incredible person, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just by this interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you just, you just seem like you've
got a great personality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I thank you for, um, giving me
this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, making this so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, it's a, it's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a pleasure meeting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, maybe someday our paths will
cross and we'll get to, to share a toke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to the ever so humble
and kind, Mad Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to his wife,
420 Australia, Mad Farmer Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
