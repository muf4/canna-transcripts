[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, alright, alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, my friends, for another
episode of The Podcast, a cannabis podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, you're joined by your boy,
Heavy Days, here from the Upside Down
[SPEAKER_00]: Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're incredibly grateful
to be joined by the one and only two of
[SPEAKER_00]: The C Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: an OG within the CBD community,
the man who brought Charlotte's Web to the
[SPEAKER_00]: greater masses, the Buck Stanley Brothers,
and a guy who's collaborating with Duke
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need to say any more?
[SPEAKER_00]: So excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two is an absolute legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to talk all things from past,
present, future, predictions, so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us for another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're joined by the man
behind The Seed Company, a range of killer
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD lines, affiliations with Charlotte's
Web, a whole bunch of other cool strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dig into a big thank you
and shout out to two of The Seed Company
[SPEAKER_00]: for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's the R4, not the Charlotte's
Web.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they named that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just I guess, yeah, we don't want
the Stanley Brothers coming after us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, let's start it off right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a bit of a rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the woo for?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came out from Cleveland and 10 years
ago, 2009, I managed to get some samples
[SPEAKER_02]: out to Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were like, holy,
wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went around and I got strains from
all my friends and collected, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was this one called the
cream and it would mess you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was, you know, like I knew that was
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my buddy didn't have that cut
available, but he had these seeds that
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy named we call Wu Tang back home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was growing his basement and get a
little mishap there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the seeds were made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we when I got to Colorado,
we ran all my gear in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I set up 100 lighter, you know,
and we ran like a small project just to
[SPEAKER_02]: get us moving with this with a company
called Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got the test back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, there was in the woos
because I had two of them, the woo one and
[SPEAKER_02]: the woo four.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, you know, and they came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was like the basically hemp almost,
I mean, like within a couple points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one was a little more
like a higher THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I they were like, sorry,
man, you're not allowed in the warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, can I get my stuff back?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wouldn't give me that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then good friend, Adam Dunn,
who I'm sure you're familiar with,
[SPEAKER_02]: called me one day and was like,
you know, dude, they came like Kelly
[SPEAKER_02]: Roller, this dude who was supposed to be
my homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Josh Stanley came shooting through
Adam's like club or place of business,
[SPEAKER_02]: the art gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like trying to get him in on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you want to you want to run,
you know, and he's like, no, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that's my dude's shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I don't want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and he called me and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then it turned, you know,
for fun, the cream was an aft jack,
[SPEAKER_02]: like an Afghani number one time to Jack
Herrera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the CBD end actually came from
Alex at Residencies, who's Soma's
[SPEAKER_02]: son-in-law.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually he passed away, but he had
been breeding stuff that Soma had created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the reclining Buddha that
actually gave all the CBD to the web or
[SPEAKER_02]: the are for or the woo for, you know,
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so I was that's when I started
drinking a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's when I decided,
you know, I got really mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these motherfuckers stole my shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're now they've got a TV show
coming out with Sanjay Gupta on CNN.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so I was just I was kind of
ruining myself at that point because I
[SPEAKER_02]: realized, you know, like that one plant
was like the key to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that that was my millions of dollars that
I thought I was going to make when I came
[SPEAKER_02]: to Colorado to be a weed millionaire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was upset for a while,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my buddy was like, dude,
you got to watch that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, fuck those dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they got my plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, just watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I watched it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what I brought was helping
people like helping somebody who couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: get any other help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that poor girl, Charlotte,
she was having like 100 seizures a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a twin and her twin sister didn't
have any kind of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see like the difference in like
the how she was growing and developing as
[SPEAKER_02]: a human being.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was not to use this word in
any way derogatory, but she was the she
[SPEAKER_02]: was retarded literally in that she
couldn't learn and grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, like is in the medical sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I realized that,
like, you know, no matter what,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, I'm helping people and that I need to
get back to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cried and like I wanted to meet her
before she had actually passed away,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: She kind of saved me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was I was really pushing my,
you know, my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing a lot of chemicals,
including alcohol and just get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, trying to because I thought,
you know, I came out here with the intent
[SPEAKER_02]: on like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing that whole thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, well, this guy, Adam Cooper,
who he helped out a lot, he had a cherry,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was like a nice it was a can of
tonic S1, and we took that and we put it
[SPEAKER_02]: on this condo that my buddy's brother
actually got in condo.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a sapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the guys that look for they go
ahead and like look for bombs and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the things that blow up and kill
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they brought some back and we intended
to use that structure of the Afghan to
[SPEAKER_02]: strengthen up the cherry, which was and
the cherry was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the extract from it tasted like,
I mean, cherries, like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncontrollably, you know, like a medicine,
which was really weird to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, wow, this really is medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really tastes like medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we I brought a bunch of stuff in my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the oh, I somebody had given me a
cut of the woo five or the are five that
[SPEAKER_02]: now came out, which was those guys,
those dickheads and stole it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They self my what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: They solved it and made s ones and sold
them for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm like a hundred bucks a piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to fucking assholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got, you know, and I got some sour
tsunami and then I got stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of different heart, you know,
some Harley Harlequin stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put it all out with the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mail cherry condo hard that we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was like, I don't know,
like eight other plants out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinate them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's when.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I had them all and I sat on them
for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then James from the seed from seeds here
now hit me up and was like, yo,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, you want to sell those things?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started packing them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a ton of weight to, I probably gave
away like, uh, at least a third of what I
[SPEAKER_02]: started with, like the can of moms and who
aren't nice people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, just, just like, you know,
trying to be the Johnny Appleseed of
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, went ended up going to the
Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that's I've only been to two of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I assume, uh, that was the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then does when James only had like 12
readers on the, it was like me and Sonny
[SPEAKER_02]: and Odie and, uh, Mike from exotic,
you know, and, uh, actually, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he ended up selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, you know, that was the first
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next year, when we went back,
like people like Duke over here actually
[SPEAKER_02]: kept people were like, do you have any CBD
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just kept sending people to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like he was rocking the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a busy weekend, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just raged out and I sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, people were coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, are you CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, here are seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, we're going to breed
with these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from that and some stuff that
James did, like basically almost 95%.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD hemp genetics in America were born
like, uh, from stuff that I had made,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, um, all that cherry wine
and all that stuff has got my cherry condo
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, just, it's crazy to think the
scope, but I'm proud of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, that's, that's all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great recount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many different angles we can
follow up on, I guess the first one just
[SPEAKER_00]: as a, as a sort of nomenclature thing,
would you prefer that both I and the
[SPEAKER_00]: community calls it woo four are for,
or are you comfortable with the name
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's web?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like woo because it gives honor to
the guy that made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, one of the coolest
things that, uh, I got to do was I got to
[SPEAKER_02]: call him after, you know, all this popped
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Hey dude, guess what,
because of you, like hundreds of people
[SPEAKER_02]: and children, and everything are finding,
and now it's like millions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like CBD, I, you know what I told my mom
before she passed away, I told her,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is, you know, obviously I
stretched it through a little,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I told her I invented CBD,
you know, and that everywhere that she
[SPEAKER_02]: goes and when she sees CBD, that was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was like, she was stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but in a way, like we brought it
to the thing, you know, so the woo would
[SPEAKER_02]: be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that gives him the, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, it was an honor to call him and
tell him that he, because of him,
[SPEAKER_02]: like people were finding relief and not
having seizures and little kids were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, we were the, my buddy, Todd,
uh, the Raven and I, uh, were the first
[SPEAKER_02]: people ever allowed us to give kids
cannabis in a hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever like in, in Colorado, at least I
know, but like, uh, we made a roll on,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I grew it and he formulated it and
these kids would have a seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe you saw it, it was all over the
internet and like you take this roll on
[SPEAKER_02]: and like hit their feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within like 20 seconds, they weren't
having a seizure anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, that was cool and fulfilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll call it the woo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get all messed up too, man, because so
what happened, it became the R because I
[SPEAKER_02]: have horrible handwriting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like I don't even type legibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so they misread it and relabeled it,
which is probably, you know, that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: something dickheads do anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we able to loop back on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How, how was it that, um, the Stanley
brothers came to sort of enter that
[SPEAKER_00]: facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what was the series of events that
led to them sort of getting access to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we harvested, we harvested the first
round.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent it to the lab lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth came back with high CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was kicked out of the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a, I wasn't, see, I'm not upset that
I was kicked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a felony that a drug felony from
like a while ago and I hadn't quite got to
[SPEAKER_02]: that 10 year mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was pretty upset that they wouldn't
give me my gear back, which is just some
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guy I came out with was supposed to
be like my, like my homie, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we started the actually, yeah,
the statue of limitations is up,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started hustling, accessing,
I was like 17 going to raves, like all
[SPEAKER_02]: over the United States, like all over
wall, the Midwest at least, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I made that dude a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think he'd be like a little more,
you know, not piece of shit, but so they
[SPEAKER_02]: kept that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I suppose the, this one isn't,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assumed the Stanley's or at least Josh
went to, you know, saw the test results
[SPEAKER_02]: and went over there and asked them for it
or something, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sounding like it was all sort of
quite opportunistic on their part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they, they, they made,
they made S1 my stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's like a sin in the breeding
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't take somebody's,
especially like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't take somebody's gear S1 and
sell, you know, make thousands and
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands and thousands of dollars off of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems like a pretty shitty thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The listeners will give me grief if I
don't try to follow up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why was it you were kicked out of the
facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Felony that was from a drug felony,
like from like 2001 and then three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wasn't off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a 10 year minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I got here, it had just been
implemented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was allowed in the facility and
then all of a sudden they were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, if you've had a felony or we're
still on paper in the last 10 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to wait till that's over to work
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that it, that was like the
actual truth that they just found out and
[SPEAKER_00]: were like, oh, sorry, policy is policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it was like their way of
being able to get rid of you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally the guys that ripped me off,
the main guy's name was Chad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just like to clarify, cause one of
the stories you sometimes hear around the
[SPEAKER_00]: community is that, um, the Stanley
brothers had this plant and they grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking it was THC only to find it was
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, they sort of like quote
swindled Charlotte's parents being like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, buy this weed, like just trying to
sell it to anyone who would buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you think that that probably wasn't
actually the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sort of had more of an idea of
what they were doing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went specifically to those guys after
the tests were published in a local,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, weed magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have it around here on the
bookshelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I've ever seen my
strains in print.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kept it, but, uh, yeah, man,
they would do exactly what they were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I know it's mine because it was a
variegated plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could see that in that video where
they showed all the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's my fucking gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I also heard that like they had,
uh, they had a Tennessee farmer,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky farm there, Rocky, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, there's just like bottles of
Eagle laying around and shit like they had
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayed it with like horrible fungicides
like, and they were going to give this to
[SPEAKER_02]: children.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's, and they probably did actually,
cause that was before we established a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, thresholds for pesticides and
all that kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was all intentional.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure about me getting,
you know, I know the felony had something
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with that, but yeah, that whole
that, yeah, that wasn't an accident on
[SPEAKER_02]: their part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did you sort of do in the
aftermath of all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you sort of mentioned that you
were feeling a bit down in the dumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of drugs and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I did for a while while I was
really upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think that's pretty
understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything in particular that sort
of helped you see the light at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: that tunnel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That video, man, with the weed with Sanjay
Gupta was on CNN and seeing that girl,
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte, seeing the, something that I
did like help anybody is cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like to see somebody in such a
horrible spot where even the worst of
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical drugs that they give to
children won't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know if you ever see what
they give to kids with seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like Valium and Keppra and like,
basically you're just fucking your kid all
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, after watching that,
I realized like, you know, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well get back to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, what I did was kind of
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, even if I don't get, you know,
like I saw the other day that that
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte's Web, the company is now worth
millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any ambition or want to try to
have some of the credit attributed to you
[SPEAKER_00]: or are you just at the point where you've
moved on and you just do another stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do you like, what are you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't afford a good lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure they can like more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then how do you prove all that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, like, you know, that seems
like a, I could, a lot of money to lose
[SPEAKER_02]: the battle, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing else, I think it should be a
goal that the, the community knows what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've contributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, thankfully in the sort of intro
you gave us, there's a whole range of
[SPEAKER_00]: other avenues I'd love to follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the first question is,
you know, given you do have such,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a focal tying in to the woo,
do you, do you still like to work with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you at the point where you've done
a lot of crosses, you've got stuff to give
[SPEAKER_00]: to people and you're doing other stuff
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, man, there's not a lot,
much left to do with CBD or my homie,
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Jocks up in Oregon is making like,
taking like, you know, OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: See any, he can back it up and make OG
Kush hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the only way that I see CBD
hemp being like, yeah, like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, for instance, I make a product
called hemp and it's a CBD tinctures and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we first start, when I first
started kilos of CBD, just the crude were
[SPEAKER_02]: like 3,500 bucks distillate was like seven
or eight or yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: $70,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, that I don't use the isolate,
but that shit was like 10, 20,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now like kilos of CBD are like 200
bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like to be able to farm all that,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, like I think CBD is,
unless you're going to do those boutiquey
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of things with it, you know,
or it's just available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, lots of seeds out there,
you know, that have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I, I'm going to try and do some
one-to-ones here.
[SPEAKER_02]: With, uh, with Duke here, I got,
I got a nice one of my projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take a THC plant and a CBD plant,
like on ends of the spectrum, you end up
[SPEAKER_02]: with like 50%, uh, one-to-one and
two-to-ones and like 25 high CBD and 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like those one-to-ones, like the,
I did the tiger beat and that was testing
[SPEAKER_02]: out at 16 and a half THC with 17 and a
half CBD on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite impressive in terms of the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like normally I feel like you rarely see
one-to-one strains go above like 10 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like, it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had some that were like,
uh, at a strain called the bird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I set it up to, uh, Alaska and that he's
got a zero THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's maybe the machines don't really
pick it up if there is any.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a pretty cool, like,
uh, you know, like if you can have a,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the THC gene is responsible for like
the plants immune system and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a pure CBD plant that doesn't have that
gene capable, like at least being there
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't, isn't as good because it doesn't
have that, you know, uh, the immune
[SPEAKER_02]: response thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, do you find that like,
you know, as an extension of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, they're more prone to pests
and mold and botrytis or not necessarily?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the woman that owns the lab,
who is a good friend of mine, she actually
[SPEAKER_02]: went through some stuff and has,
uh, uh, a non-detectable, but the THC gene
[SPEAKER_02]: is switched on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just isn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that she had, uh, not patented,
but, uh, you know, got some legal
[SPEAKER_02]: paperwork over because that's a cool,
uh, trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of do need a little bit more,
um, mothering, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's like, uh, like weird stuff
like that, like genetic abnormalities that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be fun to surf through.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And find like, uh, polyploid or like,
there's some weird auto flowering genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of come in hemp too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing CBG this year outside because
it doesn't run hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to grow some plants
outside, you know, Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you feel like maybe like the CBG is
like, uh, the gene is like a bit further
[SPEAKER_00]: located away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't, you like, you rarely get THC
being made in conjunction with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you see a full, like a 20% CBG
plant, there's rarely any, any THC in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, CBG is the precursor to all the
other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by bottlenecking it right there,
it's not really able to produce,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is it, do you think that CBG has
only in the past few years got a limelight
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of shined onto it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas CBD is, you know, sort of being
touted for a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, man, we didn't even know,
like scientists had no idea there wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: even, even an endocannabinoid system in
your body until like the mid nineties,
[SPEAKER_02]: they discovered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, we're still,
we're still, uh, as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a community and stuff, discovering like
all kinds of new, you know, like stuff in
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants, cannabinoids, like just,
you know, terpenes, like there's still
[SPEAKER_02]: like CBG has been around for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, uh, you know, as people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't have, uh, testing equipment
back in the day, you know, you couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: just take, you know, Ohio, especially,
you just can't take your, uh, weed to a
[SPEAKER_02]: lab and have them test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why, you know, that,
that wasn't really available until
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody started to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Online with medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now like, uh, I like to have a lot of
stuff tested and that gives me a good idea
[SPEAKER_02]: of what's going on in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you can find those anomalies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, I'm sure through the CBD
breeding, uh, somebody found some G or
[SPEAKER_02]: high CBG plants are very prevalent in,
um, in Europe, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, a lot of that, the hemp that
they grow is actually high CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sort of benefits do you think CBG
can bring to the table that maybe CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't quite do as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know it's really good for your
brain and, uh, your bone structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a bone, but at the same time,
man, CBG, uh, has like, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: hair I have growing and my fingernails
grow super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so I assume it's like the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the, the, I guess it's really,
I haven't yet got to, um, really get in on
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just been, I just had, I've been
growing it just cause the last couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years and I kind of set it off to the side
after we harvested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave it to my dude to make some
suppositories for some cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I guess technically I did try it,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was going to say, you know,
I saw on your Instagram, you had those,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, full spectrum suppositories by the
looks of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to ask, you know,
do you feel that, um, like suppository
[SPEAKER_00]: based cannabinoids work pretty well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard much about that,
but I'd love to hear more here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can break this down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you eat some weed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You eat, let's just say some oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets to your stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets subjected to a very low pH from
your stomach acid, which does things do it
[SPEAKER_02]: converts it does, you know, then it gets
shot over to your liver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that changes it into a whole
different chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it gets into your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you, when you boof it,
like it literally goes all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids without being converted,
without being, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go right into your bloodstream via your
intestines.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's like the most absorbent
thing ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it doesn't get converted in any
way, or like be subjected to chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: changes or anything like, uh, literally
like the THC goes right into your blood
[SPEAKER_02]: and like all that stuff just goes straight
up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You avoid first pass metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you, what's like the
onset time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I decided, um, cause I gave my
medicine to a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to try it myself and,
uh, I would just, I would do it and go to
[SPEAKER_02]: bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't like, uh, I wasn't like doing it
and like, you know, running a marathon or
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to stay up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, it would be like, uh, you know,
take a shower, do that, go to bed,
[SPEAKER_02]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, sometimes in the beginning,
I woke up, you know, when you eat too much
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, that, that hangover feeling,
I kind of had that a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_02]: but nothing major.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what to say about my
personal, you know, like I feel great in
[SPEAKER_02]: life in general, but I gave some to this,
um, one of my neighbor landlord,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, his friend who had just gotten stage
one record.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tectal cancer and he's down to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave some to him and he got his blood
test back and it didn't get any worse,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it didn't get any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the next round that we make for
him, there'll be a, uh, more, more THC
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of a rounded out full spectrum,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think those will get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've heard stories about people,
uh, you know, doing high, high THC
[SPEAKER_02]: suppositories and getting a buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep you posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, I would love to hear from,
you know, the horse's mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is the future of CBD
lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, as you mentioned in a prior answer,
you can get it really quite cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may not even be much of an
argument to grow it yourself anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pillows and, uh, firewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you think it's just going to
become so ubiquitously available that like
[SPEAKER_00]: no one will really grow it anymore and you
just buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I assume people still grow it
like, but it's like big farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, I saw they were getting down
to like, uh, like two bucks a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were buying like, you know,
a considerable amount, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're really pushing it out,
I think, you know, I mean, I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: you learn to stop growing it, especially
like as new States, you know, now that,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year is the first year that I have
been like federally legal to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to oddly enough, Mitch McConnell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to give that dude a shout
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even in a trunk, like not my favorite
people, but they actually signed the farm
[SPEAKER_02]: bill that included the hemp thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had to like go through extra
hoops, like register with the USDA and go
[SPEAKER_02]: get fingerprinted for a federal background
check and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I assume there's like, you know,
hemp farms in every state now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think we scale back from a few
years ago, a few years ago, it was like a
[SPEAKER_02]: monumental, huge amount of people growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was acreage, you know,
like, and now I think it's scaled back
[SPEAKER_02]: considerably because of the, you know,
a lot of people don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: something they can't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in terms of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the CBD lines you offer,
do you think that like a reason someone
[SPEAKER_00]: might grab one of those is because like
they might be able to find something that
[SPEAKER_00]: really specifically works for their
medical issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that in general,
like just getting any old CBD is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be about right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking about any old CBD
strain, and I don't think, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, a lot of the stuff
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's different terms,
like, uh, you know, I think that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: along with a lot of the same genetic
makeup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get a lot of mercy and a lot
of berries, cherries, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but now things are starting to,
you know, now we're getting lemon limes
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with those come different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, in a medicinal way, like the way
your brain wants, you know, like some
[SPEAKER_02]: people love smoking this train because it
makes them feel terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some people, they're just not
getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's their body telling them
what medicine they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed on your Instagram page that
you mentioned CVDV and I have to admit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't hear a lot about this at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a little bit of info about
like what it might be used for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you plan to do anything with it in
the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it four way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be confused with the four way THC
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a pain in the ass, but it's,
it's at one quarter THC, one quarter THCV,
[SPEAKER_02]: one quarter CBD and one quarter CBDV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, the only option to do anything with
this is, um, I'm going to try and feminize
[SPEAKER_02]: it on itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way to express, you know,
cause I tried to put it on some THC and it
[SPEAKER_02]: basically erased.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, you know, the majority of
everything in there and the THC dominated
[SPEAKER_02]: it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of highly unstable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure what's the, uh,
what CBDV would, I know the variant is
[SPEAKER_02]: like, uh, you know, and THC is like a
appetite suppressant and like a more
[SPEAKER_02]: speedy or, you know, alert high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what CBDV does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're venturing out into the unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it, it's cool to see, like,
uh, I met this guy, I was at a seed swap,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Duke and I were up at his seed swap
and this dude came up and he had like jars
[SPEAKER_02]: of, uh, extra beautiful stuff smelled
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't really get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I ran into him on four 20 and we were
talking and he went and learned like oil
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction, like how they do petroleum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they applied that to cannabis and
now they're going through, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: like fractional and taking, you know,
cataloging every single substance that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he was like, um, this one would
get stuck in the top of the distillate,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the, what do they call that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The head, you know, where it's hard as
rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they took that and they call it,
uh, CBDT as in trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said it would harden up like a
Lego.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they started selling it to the road
crews up there to mix with gravel and fill
[SPEAKER_02]: in potholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude flexed my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, so impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, you know, like that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're filling in potholes with pot.
Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he had found a peanut butter
strain that like when he cracked the,
[SPEAKER_02]: his brother cracked the seeds,
it smelled like peanut butter in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like any, he, I was like, come on man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, no, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's working on like, if he can make
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, take the hearts out or do
whatever it takes to emulsify that into
[SPEAKER_02]: like a peanut butter for people who can't
eat peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like cannabis winning,
like new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, Erica, her dad, Tom is redoing
a house and purchased Stateside grown
[SPEAKER_02]: insulation to do his house that has rated
better with the R value than the pink
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been, I've been about this
plant for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to see it's starting to finally
get recognized for self.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned earlier, the cherry candaha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we dive into all of that stuff,
I just wanted to ask one of the comments
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot about CBD in general is
that a lot of the varieties all have this
[SPEAKER_00]: common denominated cherry smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that all comes from that
cherry candaha you referenced?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't say all of it because can a
tonic, uh, you know, have you ever heard
[SPEAKER_02]: of Ringo?
[SPEAKER_02]: He he's passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, so he bred out that,
uh, a lot of good CBD too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't so his, his, uh,
he did the can a tonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was where the cherry came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not really sure where he had
sourced his original CBD gear from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ringo, he, he did the sour tsunami,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you because I,
I can see you've worked with probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the lines I'm about to
mention, but if you look at sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: common CBD strains you see around,
you've got, as you mentioned, the can a
[SPEAKER_00]: tonic, sour tsunami, Harlequin,
ACDC, the woo, which of them do you like
[SPEAKER_00]: the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that they're all sort of a
bit different and offer different things?
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm proud of the woo and everything
that has horrible turps and it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it kind of has like a metallic,
terpy kind of thing going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: ACDC is an awesome plant, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, uh, can a tonic sour,
the sour tsunami was kind of floppy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like had more of a, like,
uh, a weak sativa kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the ACDC is a solid, solid,
awesome CBD plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, it grew fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made beautiful, like luscious bud that
smelled of cherries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so weird, like almost like a fruit
bowl, like not even cherries, like pear
[SPEAKER_02]: and cherry and like, uh, peaches and like
all there, like that, all those fruits sit
[SPEAKER_02]: inside those kind of those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then berries, like, uh, they went and
they did that cherry wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then through that, they found some
berry flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that people are, like I said,
working to get more of a flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, like, like I said,
the boutique stuff where they mix it with
[SPEAKER_02]: like weed and then bring it back to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that original batch, I got to say
that ACDC was, uh, that was just a great
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasure to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some stuff's a little more tricky,
but so that was my favorite, but they all
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of were like, except for the woo,
uh, they all kind of were that same vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, once I did the cherry things,
they like that helped bring that out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume like the, cause the cherry back
on like all the other ones that were
[SPEAKER_02]: similar cherry were, it's crazy though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like legitimate, like cough syrup
tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really intense cherry flavor by the sounds
of it, just to loop back on that cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: candaha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it is the case that a
decent amount of, um, Afghanis probably
[SPEAKER_00]: have some CVD in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that the one you use was
really like a diamond in the rough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't think the candahar had
any CVD in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to use it for structure
cause the original cherry was like a
[SPEAKER_02]: sloppy thin plant that grew, uh,
you know, it just wasn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a good Afghan is super thick and
hardy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to impart that kind of
shape and structure into the CVD plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it wasn't, the cherry would not have
survived like in a field or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just was a floppy, like it would have
been destroyed by wind, the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to put the Afghan on it was strictly
for structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, if you follow on
Instagram, all those, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the land race guys and, um, all those guys
that were there, like they go into
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan, they're like doing all the,
the strain reconnaissance kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the collectors Izzy and those guys,
uh, like they, they're finding,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like one-to-ones and stuff in some of
the gear that they find in different
[SPEAKER_02]: regions, you know, in Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what the strain was,
but it was like, you were saying it was
[SPEAKER_02]: only like a nine to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess maybe sort of one of the final
questions to round out some of the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: topics we've covered is, are there any
particular CBD ratios that you're fond of
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain conditions, or do you think
it's all just a matter of personal body
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry?
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I don't, I try not to give
medical advice or, and I'm not a doctor,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if I'm trying to treat somebody's
cancer, I would wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would give them a one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make medical recommendations,
but I think like, you know, I think ratios
[SPEAKER_02]: are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think that like once say like a
kid with epilepsy gets used to one ratio
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, a different one helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically like, I like to give,
I think CBD is as important to like take,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feed it to my dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like shit when I woke up this
morning and, uh, like my back hurt and I
[SPEAKER_02]: went and ate some, and I felt like a
champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's just my personal, you know,
uh, but I mean, yes, I think certain
[SPEAKER_02]: people find better relief from different
ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think just CBD helps out
anybody like the isolate stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think even like taking the THC
out, like when I make these bottles,
[SPEAKER_02]: I try and get my THC up as high as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll still be legal, you know,
uh, at 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you need that whole entourage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need all your, all your cannabinoids
like together to help, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't really know a ton, ton about the,
like about the endocannabinoid system yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it all, you know, we don't know how
certain things are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard, you know, different thing to be
studying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so, but yeah, I, I honestly,
without trying to get to give,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not like a, I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a guy who grows plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, uh, I do think that it, that ratios
are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, like anything else, man,
whatever, like your body will let you know
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it'll tell you if that's what it
wants, like, oh man, I really,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I smoked that OG cush or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really like calmed my ass down and
made my back stop hurting or that AC DC
[SPEAKER_02]: really like, you know, increase my
appetite or, you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, that should stone me out so
much, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't feel my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all those things come from
different, definitely different ratios
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, different amounts of
cannabinoids within that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, I mean, I mean, we're still
discovering new stuff, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many out there that could be in
the makeup of stuff that it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I'm, uh, I'm dwindling here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just don't want to be trying to
make, uh, medical claims on the stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like I'm trying to help people
if it works, but like, I don't guarantee
[SPEAKER_02]: any of this cause it's not legal here
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like you doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pardon my aversion to, I think
everybody needs cannabis and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what works for you, uh, is definitely not
what's going to work for the next guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can appreciate the sentiment
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just one of the listeners submitted
questions that would slow in perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: right here is someone said out of the
strains you've made, what would you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend as the terpiest one to one you
offer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've only done one, one to one,
like in all honesty, that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, I'm going to do one with my lemon
G, which, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I took it to Amsterdam in, uh,
2011 and we got second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's one of the most terpy lemony
things ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here in a minute, I'm going to do my
one to ones that I have back on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that should yield something good,
but technically the, I don't even know if
[SPEAKER_02]: you can find them now, cause it was so
long ago that I did that, uh, initial CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, you know, like most of the
strains have sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I still have a bit of seed,
but they're probably getting aged,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the answer to that question
would be, um, wait and see, cause there's
[SPEAKER_02]: new ones coming, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, just as sort of the same
question, but on the other end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, we had a listener asked,
um, if I wanted to give something to a
[SPEAKER_00]: child that was going to hopefully be non
psychoactive, but still high in CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there anything in particular you'd
recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, um, if you don't want it,
like you'd have to get an isolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like if you don't want to get it,
like there's going to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you mean by CBD like extract or like
CBD strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just a strain, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can sort of do what they need to
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably want to find something
real low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, if I was, uh, you know,
you don't want to be, uh, I can't advocate
[SPEAKER_02]: getting children high as much as I'd like
to calm their little asses down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, uh, most of the stuff
that was given to children when we started
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that was real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, whoa, because you couldn't,
like I said, you didn't want to be heat,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, last thing you want as a stone
kid with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nowadays you can go get CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, you know, I make it and then
other people make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so like I said, you don't like to
grow it and then to extract it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, it's just easier to find
like a good source of, um, like I
[SPEAKER_02]: personally source all my stuff
organically, including my carrier oil and
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but like, yeah, I would want something
that would be the hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to feed your kids,
some CBD, make sure it's made from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a reasonable sort of
sentiment and full spectrum though,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is important in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In anybody eating it, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Isolates and stuff are, they have a
ceiling where, you know, they work to an
[SPEAKER_02]: extent and then it stops working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you add in all those other
cannabinoids, you get the entourage,
[SPEAKER_02]: which helps carry it past that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some, uh, some sentiments I can
get by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with the full spectrum stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's actually take it back now to the
question we normally start off the
[SPEAKER_00]: interview with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you being smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, um, JJ, uh, take me a pack of this
dirty, uh, taxi and then Duke here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, there was, I came home from a weed
show and I had like $10,000 worth of seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: from every book breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I traded them all CBD
stuff and they all, and, um, I started
[SPEAKER_02]: every, basically almost all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up with two plants that kicked
ass this dirty taxi and, uh, one of
[SPEAKER_02]: Tommy's or a Duke skunk band B twos,
I do believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I've been smoking on that taxi and
I took, and I, I crossed it with some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was the last seed run that I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's, it's dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I just, it, it fit,
it fits for what I like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like a daytime, a good daytime herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, now we're about to be,
we'll have all those seeds flowers coming
[SPEAKER_02]: up here by the end of summer, seeing,
you know, for some phenose selection,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, basically the dirty taxi it's,
uh, the GMO times a chem dog I 95,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has a couple OGs in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I wanted to ask you, I was looking
specifically at some of the crosses you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: done and the, uh, the SLV OG is a cool
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask, do you in general
prefer the SFV OG over the triangle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I did it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it just because of the dirty taxi
already had a bit of TK in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were like, you know, I'll switch it up
a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the reason that I needed that
and I worked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I live in a valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the next, the next round
will have the triangle in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's actually shaped like a
triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to make like something that
would, uh, work down here, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I love that SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it smells like weird, like some
Cologne I wore is like a 21 year old
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to pick up chicks and like tennis
balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, it just, it smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to pull a little more OG out of
that taxi because it's in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and, um, I find OGs like,
you know, I want to grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would run a bunch of them if I could,
but they're always, they're going to yield
[SPEAKER_02]: the greatest and they're kind of a
finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, maybe find something that's
going to be a little more conducive to
[SPEAKER_02]: just being a nice plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the version two is going to have the,
uh, the triangle up on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll work it back into like a
solid, you know, not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: start effing it back a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to ask you, because we spoke
about the, um, the, the dirty taxi hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask, did you find a male
in that same pack that you got the female
[SPEAKER_00]: or did you find the female and impressed
you so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: You were like, I got to get some more,
go back and find a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking the taxi now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last joint I got, uh, I've been saving
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a good, you know, uh,
you know what the male out of there,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I, we had just my, my buddy had,
I'd given it to him and he was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, you gave me a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's like, but I used it to make,
uh, and we crossed on something and it
[SPEAKER_02]: brought forth, it really was, you know,
a good representation of what the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: JJ, uh, is one of my favorite breeders,
the guy like really hits what I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's, he's honest and he's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked him like, basically,
man, that's everybody I've seen that
[SPEAKER_02]: started one pack has gotten a winner in
one direction or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got two that I really liked
the female that I kept was more conducive
[SPEAKER_02]: like a growth wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like, I like the herb on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little more GMO in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it bangs out like the weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kept that one as my female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the, the other one, the,
the males kind of got a, like a pissier
[SPEAKER_02]: smell to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, but he, he came correct with
the, the, the dirty jeans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that has started them is,
you know, I'm seeing all the nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I guess, uh, phenotypical expression,
you know, that I would expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to, I want to,
I made some dirty dirties, but I,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's not my gear, but I want
to see if I could even work it back a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit, just so I can have one that is
very represent representing the one that I
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot, you know, like it's a little
stretchier with nice big, and that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing, uh, in, in like, it's pretty
dominant in a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it see what it seems, but,
uh, I did find, I found a great plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: two, three great plants in one pack of,
I think, what 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another strength from that line,
the Trash Eclair, it looked great because
[SPEAKER_00]: it sort of seemed like it's aimed for the
general grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's THC dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pretty recognizable names in
terms of the parents got like the forum
[SPEAKER_00]: cut in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've also got another cross,
you know, the super silver haze with the
[SPEAKER_00]: diaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I wanted to ask what stimulated
you to move to these more THC dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses compared to the prior work you'd
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, so the last project that I
did before the dirty taxi was a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: like hand collected land races from like,
uh, wow, we had some like sea rey and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some African.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had like, uh, like, uh, a lot of hash
producing plan, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to remember those a while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last car guy, which is like actually
one of my favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a pre bubba bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got, um, like heavy coffee and
like tobacco and leather and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I knew that, uh, Duke and I were
going to start working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to put something together
where, you know, I want to work the lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to work more dirty stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took what I, you know, I had,
and I thought would work with it because I
[SPEAKER_02]: have some stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think would pair well,
but, uh, just as time goes on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see a lot of those show up and a
lot of stuff that I'm, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're looking for that sour lemon mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, you know, and like,
so some of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I'm going to work back that S L
V O G and I just think it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do I like to really like the
flower, it's beautiful and just nasty,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this, the, I like a big plant,
you know, like I like a big, like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the G 13 cross should, that's a small
plant, you know, like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be just amazing to have a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bigger, heavier yielding of some of,
you know, like, and it's gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to breed this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a, you know, and I had all this
stuff that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, it actually was more of a,
like, I knew we were going to move into
[SPEAKER_02]: more THC lines, but I really like,
it was like, like I found this plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was so awesome that I basically just
like, uh, I don't smoke anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have to, like, uh, I,
it's just, you know, when you find,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I wanted to make sure, you know,
put it on my favorite stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought, you know, that's kind
of why I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of those are, like I said,
will be used in further down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that you mentioned that like,
you know, having that bigger yield was
[SPEAKER_00]: important because something that has been
talked about for a while, admittedly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's coming up more and more when I
talked to different guests is that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people have this growing feeling that
we're sort of backing ourselves up against
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall with forever decreasing yields
sort of seems like as the years go by,
[SPEAKER_00]: things are just getting smaller and
smaller yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something you're consciously trying
to battle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the most of it, like, it's always
like, damn, if only that one was a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems, you know, as, uh,
so then you take those small plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: they breed those small plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get progressively smaller plants,
you know, like the biggest yielders are
[SPEAKER_02]: never the most amazing, like, you know,
you're not, they're not the super fraud,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and what, you know, it seems
that the, the most bangers are just that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like the cruel joke from,
uh, you know, from the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, man, what did you love a giant
like super yielding, but yet like banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's that, you know,
I did find that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that in the taxi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that in, uh, that skunk band
V2, like, uh, I pulled down all these,
[SPEAKER_02]: applied some outdoor plants that I had
pollinated just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we were breaking it up and like,
you know, uh, like doing like,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there was like a bunch of hash,
like I had her breaking them up with
[SPEAKER_02]: gloves and the hash has fallen through the
trim tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we did like three plants before
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up with like, I don't know,
let's call it like an ounce of key.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got on that plant and it yielded like
three, like one plant yield as much as the
[SPEAKER_02]: other three plants times three on that
skunk band.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was like the, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we called it the, what the fuck me and
my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like, I, he kept breaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would break it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him, uh, some, and he would,
he would be breaking it up and I would
[SPEAKER_02]: catch it out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I, I think I found two very good,
you know, representations of something
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's going to yield a bit and have
like, uh, quite a, you know, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: that skunk band.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made of it around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I made some dirty ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, hopefully they will, uh, you know,
if you can find a middle of the road down
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some interesting news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I guess I would love to sort of,
like follow that logic through and then
[SPEAKER_00]: say, would then you sort of agree that by
that logic, we would say that like cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: is better than TK or chem dog because it
yields less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, as things get better,
they yield less.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, man, I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, as much as, uh, it's kind of cussed
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really easy plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it smokes really well and it grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenally like easy, like, whereas
other things are a little more finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think, uh, I mean, I get good
yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I grew, uh, some of that form out a
while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed smoking it and it, it wasn't
like a depressing Yielder, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like cookies does get quite a bad
rap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was CSI who said that,
um, you know, if I'd never seen cookies on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram or heard about it, and you just
gave me a bud to try, I'd probably tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you that some of the best weed I've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think cookies is like the best at
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, you know, there, obviously there
is a reason that, um, it's been,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, recently it seems to be the
bottom bitch and everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it, and that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it went that way, but like,
uh, I'm looking forward to smoke in this
[SPEAKER_02]: Durbin tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to smoke in the skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to like, that's all
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I like my herb dank and funky as
opposed to like sweet and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird now, or there's new strains out
that I don't think they really have much
[SPEAKER_02]: turps going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, you know, people name them
weird cookie shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the trash eclair that was cause
there was already, you know, the GMO is
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured, you know, reinforce that
it's kind of like some, what would you
[SPEAKER_02]: call that out cross BX?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a name for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so it's cookies in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still back in there, like,
but it's a few out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say it's, it's like an incross
of sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but that was a, I named that,
uh, you ever watched Seinfeld?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: George.
[SPEAKER_02]: I named that trash eclair.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where George was like, that woman
caught him eating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I mean, I thought that that would
be a good, like, I like the structure of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cookies and, you know, it is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's the best weed I've ever
smoked though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I would be interested to hear,
I was cruising on your Instagram and I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: you put up a photo of a plant you were
calling, uh, Jim Lahey.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the park supervisor cross turn
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds fun with that puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: BX one in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a lot of puck in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dirty, sour puck puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that came from a root seller,
the sour puck puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude does not get enough credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a terrific breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but that's the one that we crossed the
dirty with that first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and, and John had just passed
away, uh, recently, you know, when I made
[SPEAKER_02]: that, the Jim Lahey, I mean, as a very,
uh, I was a very dedicated trailer park
[SPEAKER_02]: boys fan for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, it just kind of fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus there's a bunch of puck in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the pucks doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hockey all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So got to have some kind of Canadian
reference, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, I'm such a massive fan of
trailer park boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cannot for the life of me get my
lady to watch it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She won't have a bar of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ex-girlfriend might be the one that got
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, her name is Corey.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got a dog and named him Trevor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she might be the one that escaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, ah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you mentioned a little earlier that
one of your projects not long ago was that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were working with some land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did notice on your Instagram,
you'd posted the, the Durban, the Swazi
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Moroccan, like the little labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would they like to work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that sort of the
nostalgia people have around land races is
[SPEAKER_00]: like worth the hype or like it is a bit of
nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an awesome question actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in all honesty, like, uh, Duke and I
agree on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like, there's something to be
said about going back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I, I got this beautiful
Lashkar, uh, PCK out back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do some work with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Durban, let's start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, a lot of Durban that you get
here, like the one that is in this,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cookies, uh, that oddly enough that
extract guy that fills the potholes with
[SPEAKER_02]: the pot, he gave the Durban to Berner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, now that's an old, like that comes
from the, uh, Holland and that's crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: with an unknown Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how, why you get those big dumpy
Durban-y buds over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the seeds that I started,
my buddy, uh, pal from Israel,
[SPEAKER_02]: he went and I guess he was on,
I guess he was on vacation, but he went
[SPEAKER_02]: all everywhere that those seeds that are
from, he was there like collecting seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Durban in the wild is a much more,
yeah, scraggly, uh, I mean, the Terps were
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, I mean, it was a lot of those
that you, you know, it's hard to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of stuff like that because it
doesn't, you know, you want to see like
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing flower, but it does have that like
pro-magnum kind of, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: older school, but when you smoke it,
it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Moroccan man that was, ah,
that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like legitimate hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, like it was just a big old,
well, not even a big old, like just a hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful and it smoked well and
the, you know, the working with those was
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause we seeded them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, uh, I smoked a lot of,
you know, the, it was awesome,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I don't recommend it unless you
want to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, there's good Afghanis that
are, are wonderful, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: that those guys, they actually sell,
but like, you know, it's not commercially
[SPEAKER_02]: viable to start like these Thai seeds that
I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, they have a propensity
for her map for dentism and all that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they don't produce these buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're into like really weird,
like good buzzes, like a lot of African
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that THCB cause it's on the
equator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I do think that like,
I bet now that you get to see those guys
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in Afghanistan and in, uh,
all those little places where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting those seeds and they're showing
like the, you know, the, the selections
[SPEAKER_02]: that the farmers have selected in that
region, they, you know, they're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: their own breeding technically,
you know, as they grow, like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more the farmers in Afghanistan that
are, you know, had been growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: generations, like they're doing their own
selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're not, does that make
sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's a lot of great things
that you could like, I don't think in
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding all like the, your cookies
strange is a great, you know, way to get
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, but you know, you're not going
to get a lot of diversity out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the combos in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I mean, I love land based work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my lime tar that I just bred with that
dirty is like the limest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like fresh, like fresh limes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just squeezed and then like a weird
Turkish bizarre over the top with like
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers and like goofy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the other Fino, it's got like
chocolate and mint and like, so,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that all came from land raised stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, so I, I gotta say, like,
I think that it's going to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think that we're going to find
a lot more awesome turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuff like that in that, then we're
going to like, and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the next cookie straight is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was releasing a fish scale or
something along those lines, which is not
[SPEAKER_02]: something you should name cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of discussion around
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it might even be a rename
strain, but we'll, uh, we'll hear more
[SPEAKER_00]: about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to follow up because those
land races you just spoke about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cross them to the LGK, which I believe
is an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And was it a CBD rich one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No PCK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was PCK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So PCK is the Pakistani such Raleigh Kush
that I got from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: He at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just like, like some kind of
little, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just kicked me like, uh, 50 or a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went through them and picked out
like, that stuff just turns real purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where that perfumey top end of
the turps comes like that Turkishy weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that, you know, it smells like
incense and, uh, but the blood structure
[SPEAKER_02]: on that is just not awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fluffy, but it brought like this
whole bunch of amazing turps that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then like that, we were trying to
breed stuff that cause I I'm up at 8,080
[SPEAKER_02]: feet, which is about where all those high
regions of mountains are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to go intentionally like
the season here is ridiculously short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, I've been, I've grown outdoor
and I got my hemp side, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow up my CBG on that side and that
luckily that stuff finishes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, uh, trying to grow outdoor out
here is such a pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I grow these beautiful plants all the
way up and then like right at the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of October, you get this like
horrible week, a torrential pale and like
[SPEAKER_02]: shitty wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless you're covered in a greenhouse,
you really not going to be able to pull
[SPEAKER_02]: anything off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's all going to get messed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to breed, you know,
for the altitude and stuff like an end of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, it's nice because all those,
like a lot of those Afghans finish off
[SPEAKER_02]: relatively shortly and are used to like
this kind of same altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, might as well mimic like,
you know, the same kind of environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, that's, we're kind of like
Afghanistan temperatures, like cold snow,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the thought process on using
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus I wanted to keep it real,
still land racy, you know, like I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to, like it didn't need to be like a
PCK times cookies, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I've been led down the wrong path
by SeedFinder on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting PCK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I saw you had worked with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the listener questions we got is,
are there any other land races that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got your sights set on working with in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what, uh, land race in general,
do you think is the most interesting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I got a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my buddy, a good friend of mine went
down to Jamaica and was hanging out down
[SPEAKER_02]: there for a couple of weeks and he was
trying to find seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the last day, this old head,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that really old head, that old dude
with the dreadlocks that just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like rolls up on him and is like,
uh, Hey man, I heard you were looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: the lamb's bread and he hands in his bag
and he's like, this is my family's
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been worked for like three to
four generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I have legitimate Jamaican lamb's
bread and I don't know of anyone else with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, so I'm going to try and make
more obviously out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start them up and see how it is,
you know, what if it's just cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might've just slipped us some,
you know, but hopefully, hopefully it's
[SPEAKER_02]: legitimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, you know, I, I like a good,
weird, wild sativa, but I don't like it
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, I don't want to grow like 20
weak cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's nice to see things like
tie popping up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to work with some of that,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I am going to continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to do some youth work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The U is by PCK Lashkar Gah, which like I
said, is the last place they actually
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke flour in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I didn't mention that, uh,
as opposed to making it into hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that's the one that has that
like pre bubba bubba feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the U is like the limey one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's the chocolate one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're gonna put some stuff into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have a, the Lashkar just PCK
Lashkar that looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we'll probably work, do some work
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I'm, I'm super stoked about that
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in a world of poly hybrid,
you know, is like just some basic,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not basic, but like not,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not bred to death, you know,
a little diversity, you know, it's nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds nice, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: An injection of some fresh blood is always
welcome in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sort of touched on, um,
you know, ties and I think you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes in there and I've noticed that in
the past, maybe a year or so, like more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less since Neville's passing, Hayes has
sort of become a bit more popular in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to know, what's your thoughts
on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever want to work with some Hayes
and do you, do you see it taken off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, I love my super silver Hayes and
we have another super silver Hayes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm looking forward to doing some work
with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, now as far as giant Hayes go,
like those big, um, Tony from Boneyard,
[SPEAKER_02]: great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he had sent me some of his Hayes on
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically like had these giant
vials of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then a friend just, uh,
went overseas and grabbed all Neville's
[SPEAKER_02]: gear and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have all those in the, I think we're
calling it the Federation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the Federation, I do believe that a
lot of Neville's work is going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: popping back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like the, you know,
I listened to the PIF episode,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never smoked PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they, they had these old school
guys on talking about growing it and they
[SPEAKER_02]: were just like, it was so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just started from flour the minute it
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you save on like,
and I was like, damn, that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if you only have like a week or
two or a veg, and you got like 16 or 18
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks of flour, but it's on 12 and 12,
you're going to save all that money on
[SPEAKER_02]: your veg and be able to, you know,
um, so I think that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never done anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never just been like, oh,
if we started now in 20 weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll be done and it'll fill up the whole
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never really gotten down with
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, it's like, I have, I have the
ceiling height for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a big commitment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the, I'm cooking my dog's food as
we speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like, and it's literally cooking like
a turkey and elk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got to chop up this broccoli
and then rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dog spoiled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so, uh, I moved to this little tiny
town, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what I was going to do,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved to this, like, the cops came to my
spot endeavor and were like, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're only allowed six plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, but I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they're like, sorry, we pass a
city ordinance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they went in and they're like,
Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is nice, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to cut it and shut it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, well, so I had to move
somewhere that was respecting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people that still take care of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so I found this place and I
didn't know how, you know, I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: acclimate into a Spanish town either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody here is basically,
uh, Spaniard, like not Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this, there's some Mexican people
in my town, but basically like these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: came up from Mexico and they're,
they were Spanish and they settled in my,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so that like my landlord looks
like a piece of door kind of, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, so it's like, so I started
like giving out CBD and everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, cause there's a lot of old
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, we made some dude, um, some cancer
meds, you know, and then, uh, I met the
[SPEAKER_02]: butcher and the butcher his hands hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave him CBD and his hands didn't
hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he could continue butchering and we
made friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, now, uh, in the fall
when he harvests, you know, when people
[SPEAKER_02]: bring him the elk and the deer and all
everything, he just gives me all the
[SPEAKER_02]: scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, you know, uh, a, this is better
than dog food.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And B it's cheaper technically to buy like
rice and broccoli and just, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, do it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus I like cooking and it's really good
for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, uh, my last dogs because I
do believe because they had a good,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy diet and CBD, they lived to 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I mean, the new guy here,
he's eating like lion's mane and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, all kinds of stuff up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like a mushroom blend cause I'm
trying to, you know, I want to see how,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see how long I can keep a dog
alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like I'm dying early, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the worst part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like losing animals, the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so this way, you know, they eat a,
they eat a good diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say one of the,
one of the common questions we get asked a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot is a lot of people want to do it,
but like they don't know where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what would you recommend as like
starting doses and ways to give it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I make a pet friendly one and,
uh, what it is, is, uh, just unflavored
[SPEAKER_02]: cause you know, um, I make, I,
the other ones I make have organic
[SPEAKER_02]: flavoring like mango and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I suppose I can put a dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I give them one squirt,
like actually I worked them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dogs are 40 pounds and I give them like
what I would recommend a human is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, well, I get, you know,
to take like one milliliter, but
[SPEAKER_02]: basically, you know, everybody has dogs in
different sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you gotta, again, I'm not trying to,
well, I'm not a veterinarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but like, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, everything alive,
uh, you know, ma'am, ma'am, alien kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, like dogs, cats, we all,
everything has this cannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_02]: that has been depleted because of,
uh, the marijuana and hemp and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: being made illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sure you've seen that meme
that's like back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The animals ate hemp and then the
cannabinoids transferred through the milk
[SPEAKER_02]: and the, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we didn't, I mean,
as, uh, you know, I don't know if that it
[SPEAKER_02]: makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say, um, and then when we
eliminated that, you know, since the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid is directly responsible
for like your immune system, kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like it's, it's, it has a hefty,
hefty weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, uh, now they're finding,
you know, like, uh, but it, it actually
[SPEAKER_02]: has a lot of immune functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, so it's the same in
your dog and the same in your cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they, they have CB one receptors and
CB two receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had a buddy, I went home,
my mom had passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did her celebration of life and it
was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to see some friends and one of
my old friends came up and he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey man, I'm noticing that Delta eight is
legal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a great idea that no one saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Delta eight dog treats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started asking me what I thought
the dosage would be to like, get your dog
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and like my dogs, like not bud,
he's new, but Dozier woke up stoned as
[SPEAKER_02]: shit this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I found this Northern lights,
number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my, I snuck into my flowering and
it was a throwing bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was a Chiquita banana factory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I cut it down and I started feeding it
to the dog yesterday, not the bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: just the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she, she'll eat, she knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when she doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one did too, when they don't
feel good, they go eat the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to train them not to eat the plant,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think it's first of all
spectrum, I would think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, you would have to feel,
you know, you have to build up a dog's
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance to CBD and you definitely don't
want to get it high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't know if you ever dealt with
a, like you ever had a, an animal eat your
[SPEAKER_02]: weed or like, uh, we made, we made
brownies one time or something back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day and threw the trim out back with the
butter on and the dogs ate that thought
[SPEAKER_02]: they were, I thought they were dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just turned out they were like,
so I, uh, so, you know, be careful with
[SPEAKER_02]: anything you give your animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to, uh, you know,
make them uncomfortable or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's, I think cannabis in all
forms is good for everything with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, with the system, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw on your Instagram, you've been
experimenting with micro dosing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the low down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do a couple, uh, things for my mental
health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one of them is, uh, I do enjoy the
micro dosing of the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, I don't like, I haven't,
I actually quit drinking man on new years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to say, uh, Hey,
I really wanted to do it, but like I was
[SPEAKER_02]: drinking like, uh, six, eight beers a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: IPAs that's like 200 calories of beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had a beer belly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like being a slobby, uh,
drunk and you know, like, um, my mom
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted me to quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to be the quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt, you know, with this new thing
coming up, you know, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be just better if I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, on new year's Eve or the,
no, the night before I went up to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, have you heard of the area 420 place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, uh, so we went with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We rented, Adam rented, uh, uh,
the hot springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went up there and I had eaten one of
these little tablets with some psilocybin
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next night, my, uh,
my buddy's kid, who isn't a kid,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's like an adult, but like, you know,
uh, came over and it was shitty outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all spent new year's Eve together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, that's the last time I drank.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, we made some mushroom tea and I like
had a real deep conversation with him
[SPEAKER_02]: about why I wanted to quit drinking and
like reinforcing like in my mind when I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted that I woke up, man, I haven't
drank since I believe that mushrooms magic
[SPEAKER_02]: and otherwise like have serious and I,
you know, Paul Stamets has been doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of research on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I take a lion's mane supplement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, it's an extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do like hot water extracts on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's supposed to, you know,
has been shown, uh, to rebuild your neural
[SPEAKER_02]: network in your brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could have been damaged by stress,
trauma, drugs, like alcohol, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it also is like a mild serotonin
booster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was taking that and it's,
uh, what's the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: It, uh, potentially it's the psilocybin
into your brain more, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly it rebuilds your, uh,
clusters, you know, where your nerves all
[SPEAKER_02]: get together, 10 fold what they were like
at their height of being the healthiest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're rebuilding your brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been on that kick, uh,
and when I take, when I micro dose the
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms with the, with the lion's mane,
I have to be like really careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my buddy made, uh, he put an eighth
into like a chocolate bar and each square
[SPEAKER_02]: was supposed to be like a quarter gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like almost tripping pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have to break those into quarters
because the lion's mane makes it so much
[SPEAKER_02]: more potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't been doing that lately
because I, I noticed like I get,
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow I seem, it seems to affect me
pretty good and I get pretty high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's not productive, but like,
uh, something I'm really, really about,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm willing to scream this from the
top of the mountain is, uh, pedamine for
[SPEAKER_02]: depression and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm on the team like once every
three, three months I'll, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: procure some and like, uh, have a,
I do a thing where I, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: will fast and then do it and like do it
for like two or three days and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, come out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, when your router goes
bad on your computer and you got to reset
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you got to hold the button in and then
it's like powers back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God that does it to my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, pedamine, it's over 150,
150 different receptors in your brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been shown like once it wears off,
it, I don't know the chemical,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it creates a chemical in your brain
that subsides like depression and anxiety
[SPEAKER_02]: for like a month or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it literally in parts,
like it's fun to do because I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, um, when it's all over,
man, I feel rinsed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can, as somebody who suffers from
those things, uh, like the logical thought
[SPEAKER_02]: that it imparts, you know, makes both
depression and anxiety, like illogical,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause it's, you know, what you can't
fix the past and you can't worry about the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I have to say that's like my,
like, I don't know if I would be in,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, such a good mental state that I've
been in lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it wasn't for, you know, the four times
a year that I do that to myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's just like, if anybody that's
listening to this, like it has,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has depression and anxiety,
like that they can't kick the shit out of
[SPEAKER_02]: that's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and they have access to a clinic or
even like whatever, but make sure you get
[SPEAKER_02]: some safe shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I highly recommend that it saved,
like it saved my life a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can actually say like some of my
most, um, uh, amazing moments of my life
[SPEAKER_02]: and a couple of dumb ass moves,
uh, have been, uh, you know, because of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I seriously, like if you,
if you have horrible depression that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't think is unbeatable, man,
like they'll find one of those clinics,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, they will like, there's a place out
of Durango now by this guy named Dr. Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he, he, they like send you ketamine
lozenges and then they call you and you
[SPEAKER_02]: get to have like your therapy session,
you know, after, after you ate this,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I had some shit happen to me a while
ago and I went and got a shrink.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I preached to him the benefits of
ketamine so much that he went and started
[SPEAKER_02]: recommending it to his patients that were
suffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that they were seeing like
significant and wonderful results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so like that's, you know, that's my
regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't eat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I microdose mushrooms maybe like one week,
a month or something, but it's that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's that, uh, once every three months,
that really makes my brain feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel like a real human when I get,
when it's over, you know, oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a beautiful man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glad to hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're finding it so helpful, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, encourage anyone to check it
out, especially in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just rolled it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's a nasal spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to someone if you feel depressed
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's a wonderful, like,
um, maybe, you know, so it's the,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a disassociative tranquilizer slash
psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they were using it to like get,
they were giving it to kids back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day to like subdue them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some adult did it was like,
Holy shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should be giving that to kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's trippy as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's really like, it's all,
all over the place, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing, actually you're seeing a
wonderful amount of psychedelics become
[SPEAKER_02]: more mainstream in the uses of,
uh, you know, PTSD, like maps,
[SPEAKER_02]: just they're pushing that MDMA for,
uh, like soldiers and people with PTSD and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's getting approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, the FDA gave them the approval,
like, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they procured the amount of money
they needed to have the, the chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: synthesized in like, uh, the most,
what do you want to call that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's gotta be made according
to like pharmaceutical specifications for
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to like get that okayed by the
FDA to get the lab, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's going to be like a big,
and then, uh, if you haven't watched,
[SPEAKER_02]: have you seen Paul Stamets movie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, fantastic fun guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, like that whole, uh,
end of life where all those old people are
[SPEAKER_02]: like coming to terms with dying and cancer
and like, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine like, you know,
you're, you're going to die and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: worried about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you eat some mushrooms and now
you're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a gotta be like a,
uh, relief, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some interesting work being done in that
area for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think definitely a long way to go with,
um, you know, end of life care,
[SPEAKER_00]: palliative care, those things we could do
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, it's gotta be scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you know, you're,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's something that I've been
pondering a lot since I lost my mom,
[SPEAKER_02]: like really like, like I've been taking,
I didn't start at a masterclass course on
[SPEAKER_02]: philosophy just, and it really was like
super, very interesting because it,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, philosophy is like studying
what it is to be human.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, uh, I don't know,
it really hit me in a good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been thinking about like a lot of
stuff like that lately, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what's our purpose here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, you know, do we, when we die,
like what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things I, I have a lot of
internal dialogue, I guess, which is why I
[SPEAKER_02]: love the academy that shuts that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, look, I mean, we're sort of on the
topic, not to be morbid, but I had a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people submit questions saying,
I heard two lives in a morgue or used to
[SPEAKER_00]: live in a morgue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, what's the deal with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I, yeah, I live in an old funeral
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually I'm standing, uh, I'm looking at
the human skull and the nervous system and
[SPEAKER_02]: the skeleton system all laid out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the old embalming room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what, this is fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I was working with these ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the lady like owns the lab,
good friend of mine, like my mom kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and they, you know, I was looking,
the cops had come and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we'll give you 90 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you let me shut it down and set them in
the flower and harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then basically like I couldn't,
you know, so I was looking everywhere to
[SPEAKER_02]: move, you know, that, that was like cool
with, uh, the medical system and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, went up north in, in Colorado to
no avail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Greeley, did you know the ground
has oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oil in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, you know, like it's like the not
organic, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and they were down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were like, Hey, you should come
down and check this place out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I come down here and it's out in the
middle of fucking nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I'm going to,
you know, I shop at the whole foods,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like every guy I'm used to
having things within my fingertip for
[SPEAKER_02]: each.
[SPEAKER_02]: How am I going to, you know, and it was
kind of like, but as time went on,
[SPEAKER_02]: like this actually became like the best
option ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I come down to check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, in the kitchen, it's like
literally the posters, like the musk,
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have them up, the muscular system,
human skull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then in the drawer, like there's
like, you know, in the movies,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you get kidnapped by the bad guy,
like the German guy comes out and like
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the rubber trench coat, and he's
like, you're going to talk and unrolls
[SPEAKER_02]: that big roll of like evil looking metal
things that he's going to hurt you with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in the drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole kit, like, Holy shit that I was
like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then over here, there was like a sink that
they would hook up to basically like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a, it's a one way system.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go in through your artery and out
through another one at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they pump you full of chemicals
and like, uh, pump all your, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: your liquids and stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to move that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I removed that sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then the, one of the selling
points that he said was like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a floor drain, which is,
you know, so they were, this was the
[SPEAKER_02]: corners station too, for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody in the County came through
like this place is, you know, no one ever
[SPEAKER_02]: died here, but then it's weird to have
local people come over like say to buy CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, they're like, man, I haven't
been here since you buried my grandma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, uh, but it's a big empty
space and it's really nice that it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, like, uh, every, like no one,
I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary
[SPEAKER_02]: down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, I had a roommate, uh,
when I first moved here and he ended up,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, robbing me with this woman who I was,
uh, being, uh, being romantic with,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll say, and, uh, I had to have the cops
come through.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know like the whole layout.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what they've seen the whole
shebang.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the one cop watched me take
clones and, uh, like I need to save these.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to, you know, so like,
um, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, uh, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they give you any cool stories when
they left to make sure you well and truly
[SPEAKER_00]: scared or are you feeling pretty
comfortable there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super comfy here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel, you know, like, uh, no,
no, like I went down to the share
[SPEAKER_02]: department and I was like, yo dude,
you know me, I'm that guy that just had
[SPEAKER_02]: these problems and I do my medical thing
and this is what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, like, uh, what I don't want
you guys coming to fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you want me to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, don't go over your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is, I follow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I I'm like on the other side of
the building, I'm licensed up by the USDA
[SPEAKER_02]: with a hemp thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know what, where I live has a
weird, uh, miss balance of like people to
[SPEAKER_02]: horrible drugs, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like this area has like a meth and coke
and crack a, a pill, a heroin,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all that kind of problem,
alcohol, like, so like, I don't think,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have much more important like stuff
to do than, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of people around me,
uh, grow and they are not, they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even, I don't even think they have cards
or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird place, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's in a funeral home.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one ever died here though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just my dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the first ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the, so the landlord said while he
was building the place, uh, while he,
[SPEAKER_02]: while the landlord was building the place,
he said his brother-in-law or something
[SPEAKER_02]: came in and was like, hurry up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be the first guy you serve
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second guy came in and he was
like, yo dude, I'm going to be the next
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that dude was like, uh, they were
calling it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a weird situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and no, I've never seen anything weird
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, spirits or ghosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, that's not something I believe
in, but, uh, you know, if I saw anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, I might change my mind,
I suppose, but you know, how long has
[SPEAKER_02]: ghost hunters been on and they've never
found shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, look, while we're on the subject
of kooky and interesting, I've been told
[SPEAKER_00]: by multiple people that you're the,
uh, the Nicholas Tesla of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about this Tesla
ponics experiment you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually I'd rather fire that one back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I had like a keyhole, I think they're
called rack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like lock the little things in and
then, you know, and I had it tubbed out
[SPEAKER_02]: with, uh, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, pine liner and it was off the ground
and I had a, I had a, what do you call
[SPEAKER_02]: that thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: A heating mat in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, don't immerse in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had watered through all the plants
and then, you know, there's a fit like it
[SPEAKER_02]: was just ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So micro amounts of water in there,
but it was all submerged.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, I was the next day I came in
like, Holy shit, man, these are like the
[SPEAKER_02]: nicest plans I've ever fucking seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking foot and a half fat ass
fucking stems, like sick leathery fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves, like not a nothing out of place.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, nothing out of place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to rub my arm over them and
they fucking shocked me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got the, the multimeter and I was
running like 60 Watts or volts,
[SPEAKER_02]: Watts, volts, 60 volts to the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, like, and I, you know,
I had to ground it cause it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: grounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I hit the, I hit it on the
concrete and tested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I let this go, you know, and I was
trying to experiment with like,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more water, uh, make it go up or
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually I think the thing was going
bad because it got up to like a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: and I assume that means it was shorting
out or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then I had, I just decided that
like, um, I don't have fire insurance and
[SPEAKER_02]: like, this seems like how you get a fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pulled that experiment specific out
and then, um, I called a friend back home,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, who, you know, is, um, also very smart
human.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked into it and, uh, it's called
electro culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technique is called electro culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this dates back like talking hundreds
of years, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, for instance, um, it was like
the late 1800s, this, uh, one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: monks, you know, the guys that do like the
beer or whatever Belgian guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, he was experimenting on bacterial
growth from static electric charges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he found that you like one static
electric charge from say your foot into
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground, increased bacterial growth
400%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this dude in the thirties,
uh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude in the thirties, uh,
we took two poles and put them north and
[SPEAKER_02]: south, like big poles.
[SPEAKER_02]: He buried him in the ground and tacked him
to a big piece of metal at each end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he wound copper all the way up
with the rotation of the earth,
[SPEAKER_02]: like so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he put them on the north and south end
of this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he grew clovers that he won the
world's fair with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were eight feet tall off this
passively pulling this out of the air,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I called him and he worked at a
medical supply place and he sent me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what a tens unit is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the thing you put on like,
Oh, I sprained my arm or something and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And jackass, they put it on the good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that on the first jackass
movie?
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it on their gooch and we're just,
that was my introduction to a tens
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it's like, you know, adjustable
wavelength and like potency and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a couple of those and instead of
putting little patches on, I like put on
[SPEAKER_02]: alligator clips and I stripped down some
like a Rob X, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like wire, like house wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use the copper, you know,
I, I clamped them on and I put it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and it was getting like the same
effect, but not quite as magnificent,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause it's a lower, lower amount
of voltage, but it was consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, I got some bugs and then I like,
uh, turn them on and you could adjust it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could make, I think now, listen,
I could have been high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't document this, but I swear to
God, I could like make the bugs move
[SPEAKER_02]: faster or slower depending on the current
I was giving them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, got a couple of these tens units,
hooked up a couple of lemon plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: grew them electrically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's when we went to Holland
and got that, uh, cup second place the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole week, just tripping on acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I walked over a hundred miles
through Amsterdam that week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, we, I smuggled weed out,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's we're past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're, I'm in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got like, uh, three ounces of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Left her at the booth and, uh,
just rolling mad joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else in the spot was just like,
uh, greenhouse guys had like the nastiest,
[SPEAKER_02]: like 20 foot long balloon volcano,
you know, and like other people were
[SPEAKER_02]: giving out little like one hitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, in retrospect, after I got like
everybody, every world's flu, this was
[SPEAKER_02]: probably a bad idea, but smoking joints or
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the police raided the place and,
uh, everybody like Adams grinding up all
[SPEAKER_02]: the weed and.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, uh, stuffed it in my, I stuffed
the remaining herb into my coach and
[SPEAKER_02]: walked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the Dutch police, they didn't look
very tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put it in my arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I got closer to where they
were all at, I realized that they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: they put the monsters up front,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we're all waiting to be searched and
shuffled to get out of the venue,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Hey, because I've been riding
the tram or the bus and everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all waiting to be shuffled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's rolling these giant joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a grinder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's got this grinder, like six or eight
inches across.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it took your whole hand to like,
so he's grinding up all the weed he's got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I need a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get the bag and then I throw my
sweatshirt on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I asked for a bunch of like swag,
you know, like, so give me all these like
[SPEAKER_02]: not posters or like flyers and all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got this bag of, with the weed in it
and then the cops are like, come on.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, do you have anything illegal on
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put the bag in front of him and I
opened up like, no, man, you can search
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's grabs the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, not in there, puts the bag
down, pass me down, grabs the bag,
[SPEAKER_02]: hands it back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walk out and like, we were the only
ones with any weed for the next couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: days of the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was, yeah, like, uh, that was fun
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a killer story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other strains from that
Amsterdam trip that stand out in your mind
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite memorable?
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the, you know, like I was really
working that booth, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we didn't have, like, I mean,
when you, like, when you go to those
[SPEAKER_02]: things and like the Emerald cup,
people were like, oh, you're so lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, fuck you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm busting my ass back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, um, so like I didn't,
not that I really tasted, but I didn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly didn't, we worked, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I rolled hundreds of joints and shit,
you know, like just, and then talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the way home, I ended up
getting like the woke flu from like 10
[SPEAKER_02]: different countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know what though?
[SPEAKER_02]: A good solid weed at the time back then
was like Adam's Cushage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was something that like,
yeah, that was something that was like his
[SPEAKER_02]: buddies did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it smoked real good, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad when I met him, like,
cause I was trying to, I was wandering
[SPEAKER_02]: around Amsterdam, like trying to buy a
weed and that shit's expensive and shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then when I finally actually met him,
I could knew, you know, just it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: better herb for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've mentioned a few times you've got
some stuff going on with Duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us anything about what we
might be able to expect or is it all under
[SPEAKER_00]: lock and key?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to, we're making some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to combine our genetics and
like, you know, he's got some stuff he
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, he wants to like work on a
couple of his, you know, like the
[SPEAKER_02]: screaming Eagles and the polecats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, I'm going to lend my
lemon to some stuff and like that you,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I got this original G 13 that I've
been carrying around since I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like just like 18, 19.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's just been through hell and
I'm trying to get it worked back into some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the strongest females I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it won't turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've, I've been trying, I've tried
spraying it with silver thiosulfate,
[SPEAKER_02]: like three different occasions and it,
it'll like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push the, the, uh, male flower bananas out
and they won't open like consistently
[SPEAKER_02]: every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so we're going to try and get that to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're, we've been sponsored actually,
uh, by, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got sponsored by builder soil who
are kick-ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you ever talked to Jared
man, like, uh, they have made a special
[SPEAKER_02]: blend of soil for him personally that
it's, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he can't hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he, uh, he wanted to use like bone
and blood and stuff in there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like any good organic old school guy does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when he called Jeremy, Jeremy's not on
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's all factory farm animal
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he actually convinced them to,
uh, replace some of it with more organic
[SPEAKER_02]: and more, uh, you know, sustainable stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually, it smells terrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so they, they sent us that and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we were, we had a couple of different
options with the LEDs and those fell out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then S tech, uh, who is a,
let me, you know, this is really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: S tech, uh, offered it to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we accepted them, the other guys
were like, like just at our like,
[SPEAKER_02]: come on in.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause they're so S tech is owned by
this guy named Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack is a, uh, uh, he's a Chinese guy who
developed, uh, what do you call them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, street lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have all led street lights over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he developed the led street light,
which if you get, if you're thinking like
[SPEAKER_02]: a street light has to do what,
like project a lot of light down
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of like, you know, fog and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got a special like lensing on them
that even one of the, I'm not here to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: too much shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even one of the best led manufacturers was
trying to steal from them and they lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, um, these little row, they're
called high bays.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like maybe six inches wide by
three ish feet long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as opposed to those ones
that like spiders, I got all those like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, bars going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things have like, uh, and I'm going
to post it up here, but like a bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: looking things, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the inside the bubble is like nine
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's something about there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, that lensing that he's got that
causes the LEDs to have like immensely
[SPEAKER_02]: good light penetration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking like it was, and I'm new to
the PPFD, but it was at eight 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was two and a half feet to eight 50
from the lens, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't know if you have,
you know, LEDs generally you have to like
[SPEAKER_02]: have them slammed down on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're wifi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you control them remotely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know, uh, I, we get them and
we're setting them up and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I download the this app and at first it's
like asking me for permissions for
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, it was scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of permissions of this thing
wanted, and I didn't really understand
[SPEAKER_02]: what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I looked it up and it's actually
this open source automation app.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll control everything in your
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from your lamps to your, your HVNC,
your, uh, your just everything you could
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly want to automate and stuff you
didn't even know you wanted, like your
[SPEAKER_02]: curtains closing or your windows shutting
on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and all that's programmable within
this little app.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and if you should, I don't,
I don't want to do Alexa, but you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: Alexa too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it all said, you know, Alexa turn on
my garden kind of thing, but I'm not,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't do that because Jeff Bezos will then
see your garden, but you got secure home
[SPEAKER_02]: security.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all wrapped up in this nice app.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sends you notifications when the
lights come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I imagine like once we can get more,
uh, environmental controls, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll be, uh, automated like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lights will dim down on their own if
it gets too hot and they cover like a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice, for being a little bar there,
they cover like three by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got them in a nice line and,
uh, we just been setting it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, we got some tents from some
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to look, um, and they're nice and
white on the inside as opposed to that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, speckled aluminum or mylar or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and these are five by five,
which is nice because they're bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have a four by four that I breathe
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that fan comes on, it really
sucks in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like kind of puts a cramp in on the
plants, hydro grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the guys that gave us these
tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically we're going to showcase all
these people's products because we believe
[SPEAKER_02]: that these are, you know, uh, especially
the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are like really the, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like these big stupid LEDs that
have all these bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things are just streamlined and they
look nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to the computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it smells so good in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that soil really smells good.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hit it with the dragon fly earth
medicine also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody who's helping out men,
those, those are really nice products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I, they probably don't get to
Australia, but, uh, unfortunately no,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, they're super organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're flowing in the same vibe that
we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, basically we're just going to
bounce out seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like 100%, you know, there's no
THC in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to expand the reach,
you know, it's not my hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hemp strains are grown anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp is grown, you know, it's kind of
cool, but like, it'd be nice to,
[SPEAKER_02]: my buddy runs a wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the wreck in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'd be fun to see, um,
some of them, you know, some gear over
[SPEAKER_02]: there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you got a lot of options on
the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I wanted to ask you, you've
mentioned the, the lemon G a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the backstory on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell us about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think I heard at one point it's
like a Colombian or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'd love for you to fill me in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that G13 plant that I've had for,
since I was 18, like 27 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything about the other side
of that, uh, lemon G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not sure what the description
says, but like, it is definitely that G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've done a lot of work with it and
I get G13 pinos out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what the sativa side is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I knew, I know I'm not one to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is that it is one of the
terpiest things ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's literally like, uh, my
ex-girlfriend would break out in hives
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, my friends would puke,
um, like trimming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had a couple of people puke
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it irritates, uh, my one buddy's
throat so bad, he won't, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like lemon, lemon, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: With a funky from the G, like a turkey
gravy up underneath it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like a quintessential G right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It yields, like you could have a giant bag
of it and that's like an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got like, uh, it's so fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really have a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like one of the reasons,
like when I got back from the cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to put a Northern lights that my
buddy had been working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I wanted some density and they
flowed really well together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I also, there's, uh, it makes the
most, like, uh, a mate, like, for a while
[SPEAKER_02]: there, it was the hottest thing in
Colorado, like extract wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's that whole, that, that
delimiting just came through so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as your question goes,
man, I can't answer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure of the lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, a friend of mine, when I was
collecting strains in Ohio to bring out
[SPEAKER_02]: here, like I had been growing it,
but I asked everybody that gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, uh, when I came in, like,
can I take this with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, that's, that is the extent
of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's a lot of Ohio people
coming online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm noticing, I'm sure somewhere in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause somebody tried to call Adam after
the cup and they were trying to tell him
[SPEAKER_02]: it was skunk times Misty, which,
um, like I said, I've done a lot of work
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, you know, like crossing it with
stuff and always get G 13, my classic one
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you can see it, you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I don't know, I guess long answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you guys up to?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Oh, actually, man, you know,
like, uh, we're not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what we're planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are we going to be planning the
breeding and stuff, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, like I said, uh, the podcast and
the instructional videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, you know, part of him developing
his own soil line was because um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he wanted to be able to give
people a reproducible, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Hey, you want to grow herb like
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need, you know, here's the soil use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so we're going to do
instructional videos and that'll be like
[SPEAKER_02]: also to show how awesome our sponsors are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll be doing, uh, uh,
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were tentatively going with two dudes,
one pop or one grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then when we went a cop, we could be
two dudes, one cop, which is disgusting
[SPEAKER_02]: and funny all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, podcast was already taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll spell it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The premiere podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, man, you won the, you won the name
lottery when you got that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, dude, there's like a hundred podcasts
called the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, look, it's got us to this point,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't complain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were, you know, so basically,
yeah, we're going to do this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, um, he actually has
been sitting, he like, he's sequestered
[SPEAKER_02]: himself on the side of the mountain with a
bunch of like, uh, video editing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been learning like proper editing
and the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when, when we do this, uh, when we were
going to be putting it together,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, potential, like just commercials for
our guides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: For our sponsors and, uh, you know,
cool star wipes and stuff, interviews
[SPEAKER_02]: with, uh, weirdos that we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this one dude in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's totally fucking weird over thinking
about having him on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you don't, you want to keep you
showing good repute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, it's fun to have,
like, I, I want to, it'd be fun to have
[SPEAKER_02]: like, uh, people with their own show
series.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the, uh, people who already have their
own show show, you know, bring them all
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to take you back to the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to start all the interviews off
with pretty late to do this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, tell me about your first
experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paint me a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, all right, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, you know, I got started a little
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I met these dudes, like I,
my mom, like when I was actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: how did that work out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, around 16, I met these dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, I was a skateboarder kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom moved me to this weird ass little
town, Hick is fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I made friends with these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started hanging out and, uh,
so I never, you know, I was in one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: first classes of dare, you know,
and I never really wanted to smoke weed
[SPEAKER_02]: because my, both my stepfather and my mom
both smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought cigarettes are disgusting,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went on the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do LSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like so much that when I was like 15,
I took the anarchist cookbook into my
[SPEAKER_02]: science seizure and was like, Oh,
can we make some ass in?
[SPEAKER_02]: He later voted me most likely to do drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really pissed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he was like, no, it's a good
thing sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: We skipped school, uh, me and three or
four of my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got some, you know, quit the mad
dog, which it turns out isn't mad dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: MD isn't a standard mad dog, but,
um, and we were drinking at my buddy's
[SPEAKER_02]: parents during school time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, my buddy took his mom's bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a little like marble bowl,
you know, few inches, three inches long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they had tried to get me to smoke
before and it wasn't happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I got kind of tipsy on the
alcohol and I grabbed the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, when I was a kid,
man, like, uh, I was like the first kid
[SPEAKER_02]: ever on Ritalin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like I was, I was on some Prozac
when I was later, you know, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like in third grade, I was
tweaking on Ritalin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a gross, uncomfortable thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was on some kind of antidepressant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stole the bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I climbed up a tree and I fucking smoked
this bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got high for the first time ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I pulled like a Paul Samuelson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got down and I decided to like,
I feel pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to quit taking these fucking
pharmaceuticals and I'm just going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then shortly after that, I got into
the rave scene and you know, experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: with all the gambit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I, you know, uh, cannabis has been
since that day because I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck this horror because horrible
serotonin messing where your brain
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like since then, like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went home and, uh, I wanted to
buy a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now where can I get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So my buddy, who I just talked to earlier,
Johnny, uh, and I called her or other
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy tag and we're like, Hey man,
you're asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it took like hours to come bring us
this bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it was like the corner of a brick
and, uh, you know, they'd have seeds in
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saved the seeds out of my weed and I
went home and I, in my, in my closet,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my toy box from when I was a kid
that had things like my Dungeons and
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragons books and my tight wonder uniforms
and you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was a nerd, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I moved all that stuff out and I
went to the home depot and I got myself a
[SPEAKER_02]: little grow light, put some plants and I
started some seeds and my mom's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: so what are you doing in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I'm growing orchids mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she, uh, laughs and she was like,
you know, I grew up in the seventies,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are orchids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta get them out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, um, I was about to turn 18 and
she was like, dude, if you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: selling weed, you can't be doing it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I moved out, I got a hot girlfriend and
moved out and then we just started
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started off, we stole, uh,
400 watt high pressure sodium from the
[SPEAKER_02]: college, two of those up in a little
closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, at the time grew,
so did, you know, and then you got to get
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple thousands and, you know,
why not get six or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then moved out here and set up
like a hundred and you know, it just
[SPEAKER_02]: growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got put on probation or parole actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, I had to go sit down for a couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I really know how to make drugs in
your own home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the strains you were
first growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they have names or was it before then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, after I got out of, uh, jail jail,
uh, I'd take P tests and, um, I started
[SPEAKER_02]: dating this girl was growing some herb and
I failed the first one and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got dinged for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next one I diluted and then
the net.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then Nicole went with the diluted
one and she's like, uh, look, this is
[SPEAKER_02]: diluted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it came out of my dick and she's
like, you diluted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what makes piss piss?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like creatine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, she's like, if you test hot
again, I gotta, you're going to get in
[SPEAKER_02]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave her this big speech,
like, look, when I'm off parole,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to, I'm going to go
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's anything wrong with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably go grow some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I laid it out and she looks right at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She gave me this big smirk and she's like,
uh, yeah, whatever you want to do when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not my property, don't fail again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got, went and got some creatine cause
I was smuggling like kilos of creatine
[SPEAKER_02]: into the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and we were working out and so I knew
what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and got some and, uh,
mixed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like diluted myself, but mixed it in and
like was taking that and like I passed and
[SPEAKER_02]: then she took me off that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody out there, I mean, this is a
while ago, but, uh, I assume that still
[SPEAKER_02]: works, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just creatine though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she told, she like told me what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what makes this business?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like creatine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I worked it out and I passed and then I
didn't have to take anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I started, I got like,
I started dating this other girl and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, we should grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, well, what about getting
caught?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we set up a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little garden or basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, it was nice actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was real efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's when, uh, that's when I
turned 30 and I went over to Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_02]: I met like Adam and, uh, you know,
he eventually moved to my house when we
[SPEAKER_02]: moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pretty funny situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came back to the States with you
around the end of that nineties period.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I moved to, uh, I want to say
I'm sham 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when I turned 30 and then when I moved
to Denver, I kept up with him,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then when I moved to Denver,
I ran into him in Denver and then we got a
[SPEAKER_02]: house and then I was like, yo,
I got a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he, he ended up moving there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had like the tiniest house and six
dudes living in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I slept on bunk beds on pallet racks
with like 300 clones next to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the, it was a wild time and that
was the green rush coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an interesting time in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And were you just growing like a flower at
that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had just gotten here and I got this
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to throw away plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm growing like perfectly healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to cut them and clone them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what started with, I brought maybe 20
different things out here and like a tote
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lock and a lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once we got here, they just kept
getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we set up the cloner with the intent on
moving into a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the, that was like the entire
intent, you know, and then that's when
[SPEAKER_02]: that whole green works thing happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the whole, what we started
talking about when we first started the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's like a Guy Ritchie movie,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bounced back all the way to the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and that, and that's how all that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm interested to hear in the
early days, were there any breeders you
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically were sort of looking up to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were like 18, some friends,
you know, they decided to drive out West
[SPEAKER_02]: and like go to BC and they called Mark
Emery and that dude like, Mark Emery
[SPEAKER_02]: showed up in their hotel room with like a,
like a photo album full of seeds and they
[SPEAKER_02]: ended up getting, I don't know,
a few different things from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Sager and Mathis, Bubble Berry,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what else do we have back then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Callie Mist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some skunk number one, you know,
like that was what like 1996 maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't really know about all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just, I didn't really realize
like the whole, like, I didn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I didn't really realize the
whole scope of it until a few,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, later until then we were just
growing like local strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this G and this Afghani number one,
that was like the nastiest stuff ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cream, which was Charlotte's mom,
that stuff was a little later in the
[SPEAKER_02]: stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was more like what was regionally
available than, you know, and I assume
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of that stuff was procured from
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people do go out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, it was a stoner pair,
you know, that's where you went for
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what the cream was?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's the Afghani number one times
the Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afjak, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you said that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would make you stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would like make you so stupid that like
you couldn't function.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I thought it had some other
medical quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, it's funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I like the Afghan number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're, we're on like a, you know,
he's got some stunk and I've got,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got that Afghan one coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found somebody, uh, the internet is a
wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes like, uh, there's like the clone
trading and like the, it's, you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the genetics, they're moving all
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to get pests and disease
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or nowadays, man, like nowadays viruses
are, they're all the rage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that seems to be the zeitgeist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be relatively new down though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that it's something to do with
like the hemp thing that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's certainly spread,
uh, sped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the spread of a lot of Veroids and
various other sorts of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It, I've seen some ugly hemp plants that
had some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my buddy puts himself out,
they had like a, it was some other weird
[SPEAKER_02]: virus you never heard of that affected
like beats or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looked all like cabbagey at the top
and all screwed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so when I got here and we set up this
big warehouse, the idiot that I came out
[SPEAKER_02]: here with, uh, Kelly Roller, uh,
this dude would lay under the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning the plants, smoking cigarettes,
like right at the stoma body, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'm pretty sure like that's how you
get tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know, I'm into hops man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I quit drinking, I've been,
uh, I went home to Ohio to do my mom's
[SPEAKER_02]: thing and I hit up the non-alcoholic beer
section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause all my friends back home are
brewers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my one buddy is like a master brewer
at a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to be able to like, you know,
so I ended up buying like some
[SPEAKER_02]: non-alcoholic brews and, uh, these hop
waters that is just hops and carbonated
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, those turned out to be excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still have all this brewing
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to master those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and at one point I was like,
dude, if we, uh, if we put some hops into
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, tea, we could probably,
and then it was like, nah, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: hop latent virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's you want hop latent virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably how you get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did that once way long ago and it
really did make them the herb more funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, and it was stony or like the
murder scene was up, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I wanted to ask you, what can you
tell me about the G 13 clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've said a few times, you know,
you've had it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw on your Instagram, you're doing
the reverse or with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a bit about what your
plans with it are?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can give any insight on the
backstory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my first, uh, spider mites from this
kid, Jason Cantrell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's passed away, but they came on
this Afghani number one and this G 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were told like, basically,
okay, so if you find an old seed catalog
[SPEAKER_02]: from back in the day, there's like the,
one of those old ones, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like black and white and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a picture of the G that I
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like cut only.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was, uh, the, the lore behind it is
what is it Mississippi or mass
[SPEAKER_02]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the, uh, federal marijuana
growing program going on for like that
[SPEAKER_02]: dude who you always see that gets like the
fucking ridiculous size, 10 of joints
[SPEAKER_02]: every month.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like the only guy left on that
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, supposedly then it came out of there
and it was an Afghani and they started
[SPEAKER_02]: like so many seeds and that was the 13th
one that they kept supposedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then somehow I got over to Neville
and then he showed that picture and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it started getting crossed with stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people, that's what,
you know, there's a lot of G 13 crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Duke here was really nice enough
to back me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed him, I had one in the green
intense crossing with a sour and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, dude, that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he, we, uh, you know,
then he showed me like that his 88 G 13
[SPEAKER_02]: HP, it'll have that same vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, which other one, the airborne,
uh, which, you know, I've seen,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it had it, but this is like
a more concentrated version of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, he's got a couple of things
that have that in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try and put it on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a funky little smells like
food, like, uh, I don't know, ugly little
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, but yeah, it's like, if you took
the lemon off the lemon G basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, you're left with the G, but it,
you know, um, it's been beat up man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think that, that cut, uh,
I want to, give some props to a guy I call
[SPEAKER_02]: grandpa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he's one of my best buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him back when I was like 17.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the first guy I ever knew to grow a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: He called it Sasha.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he was the keeper of that G for
many, many years, but it has probably had
[SPEAKER_02]: every single bug you can think of it's
fought off fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been, it's never turned herby ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can't get it to throw a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like super solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so it's just been hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could use a little
rejuvenation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, luckily for a buddy named
Nick McCombs who got the job at green
[SPEAKER_02]: works after I was fired or got like,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he saved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He saved a couple of my things and got me
the, that's, you might've given me my woo
[SPEAKER_02]: four back then I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he, he like got disgruntled with the
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he stopped working there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, uh, yeah, I got, he, you know,
he kept some of the Ohio celeb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when these guys, like I said,
these Ohio guys are coming out now,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like being a little more,
uh, on the instant stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see guys working with the lemon and
all this, and, uh, they say they have the
[SPEAKER_02]: G, but when they, when I ask them for
pictures, it's definitely not my G.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like it looks more like the
airborne, you know, bigger bonds and not
[SPEAKER_02]: quite the, cause my G is kind of like
bluish green and like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not the same plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when Adam moved out to Colorado,
he said, uh, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said his goons and they were awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two guys came, big Mike and,
uh, Sam squanch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what that dude's name
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had gotten some herb and some of
that G and, uh, he woke up and I handed it
[SPEAKER_02]: to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Hey man, this is my G.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took a big old hit and he got this
look on his face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was pissed and he's like,
I don't know if I like that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's got a, not a normal turf
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's important to bring back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're just getting homogenous turps
kind of like now, you know, it's weird how
[SPEAKER_02]: we have, uh, what's the new one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, I think that's the new,
and before it was fruity gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate fruity gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like, Oh, my weed to be just
funky and fire and gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like keep your, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's fruity, I want it fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks at trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, you know, there's,
we're going to have to break free of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, this weird mold that we're not,
you know, like the mold that we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: trapped in when it comes to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can only breed something so
long like right before it becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was in a argument, I was in a
conversation with some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about like, you know,
F1s versus like F5s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, you know, respect the work
F5.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you start them all, you're
definitely getting the whole, it's all the
[SPEAKER_02]: same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, and that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want that exact thing, but it kind
of loses a little oomph and like those
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh F1s or even F2s, man, all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you get a, I like to feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the fun part of, uh,
of growing weed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's fun to do, but like,
yeah, man, I want to, I want to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see different, uh, expressions
in the same blanks, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see those guys talking about like
heavy apps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I took it to F20.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was homogenous at like five,
kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see what your, what was your
purpose?
[SPEAKER_02]: So plus, uh, both, you know, I'm really
excited about this project coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, uh, Duke and I get along
well, we both have the same kind of style
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to like regenerative soil,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you get the best herb with living
soil hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're wanting to ask you actually,
what advice would you give to an aspiring
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who's just looking to get into it
all?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uh, Tommy has a saying,
uh, breed with intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like what, what's your goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's your purpose?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, uh, like why, why did you
choose those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what about, you know, what about that
plant gets you going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why do you like it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's so special about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uh, what's different?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's weird how there's, there's so
many breeders out there now and they each
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, most of them, there's a
few of them just do that hype on hype on
[SPEAKER_02]: hype, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, a few of them like JJ,
Duke here, they all, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they try and work it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like don't just buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a temple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got was given a 10 bag of seeds and I
bred with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, I did because out of literally
$10,000 worth of seeds that I started two
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, like there's a lot of garbage in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are like, some of those were
like $200 packs from people who were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, breeders and stuff, but they
were like the most garbage shit I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, start with fucking bangers,
you know, like I chose that taxi because
[SPEAKER_02]: it hit me like, man, I love this weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is my, what weed should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hits all the notches.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got this crazy like mouth feel that
like leaves that greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like some, I farted in my mouth or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and you know, I enjoy a weed that I
could smoke all day because like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I smoke weed all day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it fits into my, so my growing
style is I got these big ass beds,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like full of soil, which is,
I'm still getting the hang of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's some, it's an
interesting, you know, when you're working
[SPEAKER_02]: with all one big bed, it's an interesting
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some blue mat to water it in and,
uh, I use AMBESA soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely not something you can
get down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my buddy Rich makes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all like small craft blended and it's
all super, uh, I think the plants eat
[SPEAKER_02]: better than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for instance, I mean, alfalfa,
kelp, protein, soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some yucca, yarrow, spirulina,
corella, comfrey, wild yam root,
[SPEAKER_02]: metals, horsetail, moringa, geomoringa is
like one of the healthiest plants on the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, as far as like antioxidant
properties and anti, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look into moringa, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like, oh, it is, I don't even know
how, like it is one of the most medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: plants on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, Hey, start with something you
like, um, something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: why you have a purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why are you, you know, just don't
take two stupid things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start, you know, and pick whatever out of
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be, you know, like if you're
breeding for excellent genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to, uh, start with the parents,
you know, like, uh, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of the, what the next one isn't
applicable to a lot of people unless,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, uh, when Ben Draugr
started that skunk number one,
[SPEAKER_02]: he started 10,000 seeds and whittled it
down from there, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: a high amount, what do you call that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a, a large, uh, population,
like a good seed pop, you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: A phenome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start, you know, 20, 20, 30 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see winners come out of
those for the most part, unless you're
[SPEAKER_02]: running like JJ's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they come out to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give that dude props again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's a fucking terrific breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, uh, uh, you know,
I, I'm honored that he lets me work.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he doesn't like a lot of people
working with himself, but he let me do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I sent him back, uh, all the seeds
that I made with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent him back packs and like big ones
and, uh, for him to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're gonna make seeds,
don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't S one somebody's gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't like reproduce people's gear that
they're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like be your own, like,
you know, make your own path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like find weird shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find the one that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like actually try and get like reasons
like why you put those two together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what about, you know, what do you
like about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think that your mail,
which you should run at least to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what's going on and make sure
you check everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like, uh, if you, if you create,
if you cross two plants that have a
[SPEAKER_02]: propensity to be hermaphroditic or
intersexual, you're going to breed that
[SPEAKER_02]: gene in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just going to like magnify the
chances of that, uh, showing itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, you know, be original,
I guess that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we need more, uh, need more weird
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't fucking care about how your
cake tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it's like what,
like try and make something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like give, give props to the people that
you, that you consider great and that you
[SPEAKER_02]: work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, like if you,
like, if you get seeds, if you buy a pack
[SPEAKER_02]: of dirty tat, you know, one of those,
and you decide you're going to cross it
[SPEAKER_02]: with something, uh, give the shout out,
make sure that the, you know, you're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, don't be naming your fucking weed
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate those cats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally like grow the seeds,
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I see people like, I need good names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, like just do some
work first, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the single most memorable cannabis
experience you've had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when in that cup and like,
uh, 2011, the second place, that was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty cool.
Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: see in there, you know, actually,
uh, my life is the single most awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis experience I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, uh, it's funny now that
I'm getting older and meet people who,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they, they've jumped from job to
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you tell them what to do,
they're like, oh yeah, how are we even
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, 27, almost 30 years
now, people are like, wow, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a really long time to be in a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cannabis, like cannabis is like,
I live for this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work for this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the plant isn't looking right,
I don't feel right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, yeah, this, my existence is the
most, uh, the most memorable cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: event ever in my, in my personal life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like every, and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every time I think we got it,
like, you know, that winning that cup was
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on here was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like meeting Adam was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, like, like breeding all that hemp was
fucking amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the fact that, you know, like the CBD
thing popped off, even though it did the
[SPEAKER_02]: way it did, like, you know, knowing that
like something I did brought, like helped
[SPEAKER_02]: bring the whole thing to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next thing you know, it's on TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing you know, hemp's getting
legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel like I had a hand in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes, that's fulfilling to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, knowing that, you know, I dedicated my
life to this plant and it actually did
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the most significant one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that I know that I did something
like profound in the, what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next question, what is, a strain where
all of your friends were hyping it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you like, man, you got to try it's
the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you finally tried it and you were
like, oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate, um, and no offense to Jeff from
Irene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: People I know like love that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, ah, that's gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, just not, it's, you know,
like I said that my brain isn't on the
[SPEAKER_02]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and recently my buddy's been trying to
convince me of runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I knew the guy that made runs
is like a millionaire now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he's like, he's just trying to
convince me to like, you should try
[SPEAKER_02]: growing this once, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, you know, man,
I think we got more like, I don't think,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I don't think Duke would be like,
yeah, bring on the runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to cross some runs for
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, to be honest, uh, I have a couple of
things that I like here, like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cushman's and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of Bubba ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I might do like a side project
when we get some of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I think that that's a good
strain that rabbit hippie cut is it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and this is why it's an amazing,
like it's on its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that Bubba, but it's a little
like sweeter and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it stands out.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried it myself, but there you
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the next one, imagine we're on a
boat and I'm going to drop you off on a
[SPEAKER_00]: desert Island and you can take three
strains with you to grow for the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll probably need some for pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take a heavy indica and
ask Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which one though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, damn, that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I would take an OG coach actually,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, before I smoked OG coach, I thought
people from California were just a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of pompous douche bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that that's changed a lot,
but, um, they would always be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I only smoke OG Cush grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, whatever dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hundreds of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just, just fuck off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then I smoked some good OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know, all right,
I can see what, and I think it's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: strain now that I've, uh, kind of
experienced, you know, um, a few different
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were talking about the San
Fernando Valley, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, also there's this one out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Called, uh, the, the coal Creek,
not the cold Creek, whatever the cold
[SPEAKER_02]: Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that one is like spectacular and
juicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yes, one would be OG coach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the second might be that Afghani
number one for back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but nostalgia has a lot to do
with your memories.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like as far as I can remember,
it was nasty, skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthy, like stony, like grew beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then something with CBD,
I suppose, you know, you're going to want,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I'm stuck there for the rest of
my life, I'm going to need medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So something full spectrum, like,
uh, cause at that point you don't need a
[SPEAKER_02]: one-to-one cause you got your weed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, uh, this, canna so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fucking beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Ian and I put it together and
it's canna suits, canna, uh, tonic sour
[SPEAKER_02]: tsunami, uh, and Harlequin with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all like, basically he just,
we put them all in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns purple, has that fruit bouquet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, have you ever smoked any CBD
dominant bud or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, they say it's not psychoactive,
but, uh, you know, I'll be damn man that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, sure put some kind of feeling on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something like that, like the ACDC or,
uh, the canna so hard or just something
[SPEAKER_02]: that smokes good and grows well and does
CBD just cause I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not, yeah, we're just growing it to
stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a followup, we're going to drop
someone else off on the island this time,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone you're not a big fan of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to choose what three strains
you're going to leave them with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you give them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dr. Grinspoon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up hill battle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some hemp, CBD hemp, you know,
you want them to stay healthy enough that
[SPEAKER_02]: they live a long time, but you don't want
them to get as high as they potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: could.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, uh, some pure haze, throw them a,
you know, love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to have to work for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, so I get to leave or do I,
I don't have to stay with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, uh, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the final question, I'm going to
give you a time machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go any place geographically,
any point in history to collect some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or a clone, where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: The future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to bring, I got that the integrity
weed that saves the future from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why would you, yeah, I go,
I go forward in time and grab,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, once they, once they figure out
and get it all, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know, you know,
like everything now is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you look hard enough,
you can basically get, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like you want old Mexicans,
you get old Mexicans, you want all your
[SPEAKER_02]: classic, you know, tie, all that stuff is
still available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, I don't know what,
why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that's not old, you know,
does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, no one's ever said they're going to
go forward either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that for the uniqueness,
but that's in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in line with this whole episode,
given you bring a unique perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we've enjoyed very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, I think that just
about brings us to the end of things with
[SPEAKER_02]: our show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap it up here.
We're going to wrap it up here.
We're going to wrap it up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of her, like she raised me and
there were, you know, like, I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: she knew what she was doing, but I would
ask her to tell me stories about the
[SPEAKER_02]: seventies and Timothy Leary and Woodstock
and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom wasn't like a hippie or like a,
you know, but she, she was, she grew up in
[SPEAKER_02]: that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the more she told me all
about LSD and like, you know at Furt,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people were jumping out of
buildings, but that got me curious and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what led me to, My alternative
lifestyle that I chose was I think due to
[SPEAKER_02]: all those pharmaceuticals that they gave
me as a kid, but she supported me through
[SPEAKER_02]: like, okay, here, quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go to her house for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm there on Christmas Eve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a drug lab, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I got busted more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like on a lot of drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was breaking down because,
you know, near your mom's house,
[SPEAKER_02]: all fucking fired up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on Christmas, you know, looking back,
like I'm fucking up and she comes up and
[SPEAKER_02]: she's like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, it's just, you know,
life itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, you didn't kill anybody or
anything, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, actually my dude and I
have the nicest drug lab you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have a drug problem and she
looks, she sits there for a minute and she
[SPEAKER_02]: looks at me and she's like, well,
if you own a candy factory and you ate all
[SPEAKER_02]: the candy, you wouldn't be in business
very long, would you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that was, you know,
so yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope she's, I hope she's telling God
jokes, even though I'm an atheist.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope she got what she wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like making that dude laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge love to all the moms out there,
especially to yours and the thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: again, the man behind the seed company,
a range of killer CBD lines, a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: killer THC lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed company too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much again for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can call your parents and tell them
you love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go spend more time with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably, I mean, that's what a lot
of them want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they only last so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it, my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge shout out to two for coming by,
sharing all his knowledge with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as we
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just about does it for this one,
my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check you on the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Heavy D signing out from the
Upside Down library.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
Bye.
