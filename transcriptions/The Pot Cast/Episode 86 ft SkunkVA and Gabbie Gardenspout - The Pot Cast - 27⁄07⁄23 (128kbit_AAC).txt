one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked to join SkunkVA and Staten
Island for an old time catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of banter between these two guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cool old school stories, a bit of
history, and some plans for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, welcome, welcome everyone to a
special episode today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are thrilled to have a reuniting of two
old friends, sharing some old stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: some memories, a massive welcome to the
Chem Kings, the incredible SkunkVA and the
[SPEAKER_00]: infamous Staten Island, AKA Gabby Garden
Spout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us today,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a whirlwind it has been over the past
few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing you come to the surface of the
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you been up to recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've recently been hired as the
cultivation director at Green Brothers
[SPEAKER_02]: Farm in Lockford, California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fully complete being built.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we're putting in the racks and
the lighting and have to get the final
[SPEAKER_02]: approval, you know, from the city that
everything is proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping that we're operational
July 1st or July 15th.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm extremely excited about this
project because it's quite a large one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been being put together by a
group of people that I've known since the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of the Garden Spout.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're hiring people that they know
and trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how I was brought on to the
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so far, everyone else is
being brought on the team is people that I
[SPEAKER_02]: know and people that I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's exciting because normally,
like a big project like this is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be super corporate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this one isn't,
although I'm you know, I know it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: financial backing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a family business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you, Jason?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Jason is making the chem dog
seeds of the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: With his company, Lucky Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing I was in December, except for
the new news is I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned it is we're back open here as of
January 6.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole state shutdown license transfer
thing is over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're just trying to get people back
to the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we got some bigger things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making a solventless lab right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting inspected on the 25th.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be doing all solventless
products there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then me and me and me and my buddy
Gabby have some good news, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're we decided to team up and start
working on providing some genetics focused
[SPEAKER_03]: on clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do some seed
collaborations together with some breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem dog heavy, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I'm super fucking
excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super excited to be working with
Gabby.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had literally 30 solvents years of
knowing each other as of February this
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We met in February of 1993, all those
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it just I mean, we talk a lot more
now and it just feels good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm fucking excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know my friend Gabby's excited and,
you know, ready to just get it going on
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of, you know, put the put the old
school and the chem and the chem kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff to gas back in what's available out
there for folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're definitely hungry for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did this first come into life?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when did the wheels start
turning on that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exactly what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We planned this all up 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just waiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just wanted to make it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we got it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, sometimes there's a pause in the
middle, you know, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason was actually the first person that I
ever partnered with in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was growing prior to that,
but I was doing it on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jason was the first person that I ever
helped grow and that I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: were partners initially at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think and Jason's memory is much
better than mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the arrangement that I used to
make with people when I would set them up
[SPEAKER_02]: is that like we would share the first
harvest or the first two harvests and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they were on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what I did with you, Jason?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you had a much, much freer deal for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a so whatever we grow in the
bedroom, I show to you and you alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Minus my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a good deal for both of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a pretty good deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, and I was already at the
time I was already buying every bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: your crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I actually had a little piece of
paper in my wallet with phone numbers on
[SPEAKER_03]: one side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, these pages of paper fall
apart, you have to redo it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the back, it was your harvest
dates that you kind of would whisper out
[SPEAKER_03]: to me, you know, so I could make sure to
get in touch to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when those buckets of super skunk were
ready, I could go in and get them because
[SPEAKER_03]: you always had, it was always Tupperwares.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's never bags, there's never bags
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always perfectly cured weed and
Tupperwares, brand new Tupperwares.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Tupperwares of course came with
the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put about a quarter pound of whatever
it was in a Tupperware.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was always making sure that there
was no reason to sell to anyone else
[SPEAKER_03]: because I would show up and smoke with all
my friends, you know, I was listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: the podcast number two, where Jason was
telling the stories about how we met.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that, you know, not to be too
redundant, but I hope Jason will tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: story again, because if not for everybody
else, I just love to hear it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for my own selfish reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, like he'll tell the
story way better than I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, please do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be surprised how often, you'd be
surprised how often I get to tell people
[SPEAKER_03]: that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually fucking love telling people
that story because, you know, my memory,
[SPEAKER_03]: the way, the way my memory kind of works
is like, I get visuals, like I remember
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, moments and like very
detailed moments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I can even smell, you know,
like the panhandle park, it smells like
[SPEAKER_03]: eucalyptus, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's got a very unique smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like that jogs my memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that, you know, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back in those days between,
you know, Grateful Dead tours was for
[SPEAKER_03]: three times a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was, uh, at this time of permanent,
you know, on tour, I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do we call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lifer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on tour, you know, I didn't,
there was no place for me to go after
[SPEAKER_03]: tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was the band and San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're, you know, you're,
when you're in Grateful Dead land,
[SPEAKER_03]: money's just in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to, you know, you know,
kind of do what you got to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: reach up and grab your bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's a marketplace, you know,
a lot of people kind of don't know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ones of us that were there kind of
overlook it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we don't like to talk about it
because maybe what we were selling was
[SPEAKER_03]: probably, you know, not legal still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, but when you left tour,
you know, making your money was a little
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would end up in San Francisco mostly
because the next shows are probably going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be Jerry at the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also that's just kind of where
everybody landed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, also because the Grateful Dead
literally told you to go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but anyway, so you go to the panhandle
and if you're, if you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: while you're there, you might as well sell
a little herb to strangers to get your
[SPEAKER_03]: head stashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of what my day was like
every day for those periods of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sitting, the thing about it was,
is there was a spot where everybody would
[SPEAKER_03]: hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was where, you know, there was a
rail there for skating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's like a big blacktop in
the panhandle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you hung out there, the problem
was that the cops would come sweep the
[SPEAKER_03]: park every now and again, and they would
roll up on dirt bikes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if you were holding,
you know, you might have a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking like an instant felony.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, you know, 1990s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, I would always stick away from it
because it wasn't really fun for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like stressful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was fun for anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was stressful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, the strangers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm sitting on the bench in the
panhandle and the panhandle was like a
[SPEAKER_03]: long, straight, thin piece of the park of
Golden Gate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why they call it the panhandle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sitting on this sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see people walking from very
far away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here comes this guy with his big old
grin on his face.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's got a hip sack on,
he got a ponytail and he definitely looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like he wants some weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow, man, I slow down,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, don't be so loud about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cops are everywhere, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, so when he got to me, I was ready to
serve him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before I could say anything,
he introduces himself in a sick New York
[SPEAKER_03]: accent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he asked me, he says, you know,
I asked him, do you want to buy some herb?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, actually, I'd like to,
I was going to ask you the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, well, what are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's like, I, you know,
he told me basically what was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very open.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, you know, I've moved to
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came out here to see the Jerry Garcia
band as much as I can at the Warfield,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I totally understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was no need to explain that any
further.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said that, you know, he didn't know
anybody, which I didn't know anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: either, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understood that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was having a rough time,
you know, getting his ends met financially
[SPEAKER_03]: because he couldn't sell the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go look at the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we walked all the way over to the
central district where he had his van
[SPEAKER_03]: parked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I'll just tell all the
details.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had the van.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had this long navy blue van.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of hard to explain,
but the only way I can explain to your
[SPEAKER_03]: audience is, you know, if you see a van,
like an old, like, you know, Dodge van or
[SPEAKER_03]: Chevy van, and you'll see the extended
band, you can see the line on the back
[SPEAKER_03]: where it actually got extended.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this van actually had another line
with another two feet behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how long the thing was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabby, you might know or remember,
but it was like, it had to been like 16
[SPEAKER_03]: feet long, 18 feet long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was incredibly long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we pile up in that thing and we kind
of leveled out his scale and he pulled all
[SPEAKER_03]: this amazing indoor weed out, the
Francine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember the fluffy sativa
one, but that was the one that really
[SPEAKER_03]: crushed it that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those were the only two and it was
very little Francine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gabby had mentioned earlier in episode
two on your podcast that I had mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: that he was showing me the chem-dog and he
was right in pointing out that that would
[SPEAKER_03]: have been no way he showed me chem-dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was Francine and some fluffy sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can I interrupt you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to leave me every opportunity
possible to put you in your place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't just, don't just admit that
you're wrong before I get to tell you that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't rob me at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have most of the moments
and there's just like a couple here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there that, you know, I just, I need to be
able to, you know, have that for myself
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the big star over here and I'm,
you're the big star and I'm just like the
[SPEAKER_02]: up and comer and everything, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the legendary, you're the legendary
Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you just didn't know it until
the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, at first I'm just like,
I was so offended that people were calling
[SPEAKER_02]: me Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can't think of anything nicer to
call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, I mean, you said such nice
things about me on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: how I like grew the best indoor weed you'd
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, but then somehow I'm just
known as Staten Island, like the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: place that smells bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not name you Staten Island,
but I have called you that because the
[SPEAKER_03]: public led me to call you that,
but I did not name you that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you do know that once you're,
when you're inside New York and you're a
[SPEAKER_03]: New York native, like you are Staten
Island is one thing, but to the rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: the universe, Staten Island is just New
York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call me New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call me New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I sound like a fucking baller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I sound like a baller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I just sound like there's
something wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you remember a few years
ago, there was like the garbage barge that
[SPEAKER_02]: was stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had nowhere to like put the garbage
because they wouldn't take it anymore on
[SPEAKER_02]: Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just like, it was literally just
never ending garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a dump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you were right outside a brother's
pizza, it smelled bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Oh, so, you know, so backstory,
what was going on in the city and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, February of 1993 was, you know,
so, you know, you're going to find some
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor weed, October, November,
December, January, especially,
[SPEAKER_03]: but around time, January comes February.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts to dry up, especially back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those years, for some reason,
it was just so hard to get like good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to get weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So weight is what that means is you get
weight means you're going to get 28 grams
[SPEAKER_03]: for that ounce, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Weight is what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go break up some hates like
eights, but hate street.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hates hates is where you get 10,
if you're nice, 11 or 12, if you're kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of stingy eights out of an ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So four eights for you, eight for the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's how you make a little bit
money on a $425 ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where your buddy, this isn't
like tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's going on in the city at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, it makes things very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the money, you don't make enough
money to, you know, barely get by or
[SPEAKER_03]: survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there he was, Gavin, we're in his van.
[SPEAKER_03]: He shows me, he opens up this double bag
and I'm like, holy shit, that's fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't seen any of that around here in
a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, mostly it was like outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he said, I was like, all right,
well, here's the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much you want for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't remember exactly, but the
number 285 tops my head or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 325 pops my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either one of those numbers would have
made me, holy shit is what I would have
[SPEAKER_03]: said, because that would have definitely
helped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, listen, if you just stay here
and give me a minute, I cannot walk around
[SPEAKER_03]: this double bag in this neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't last very long.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you stay here and just bear with
me, I got a lot of walking to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I can get rid of all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just hung out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to interject something that
you said on the previous podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure you don't skip it
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said in that podcast that it was the
greatest indoor you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should focus on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for too long, but the greatest indoor
you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had seen some at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, 20 year old JK, that's me,
20 year old JK walks, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: his whole deal in the country was to find
the best weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what it was all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, you know, the weed is right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to do that, you know,
back then you kind of had to like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, network with growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I was happy to meet a new
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I can't disagree about it
being the most high quality indoor I've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the guy puts his, yeah,
he grows incredible weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He always has.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is the man who taught me
everything I need to know on day one cuts
[SPEAKER_03]: and all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I was so like elated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't believe it was like my lucky
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was, you know, it helped me out so
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that day I was a rough day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a rough period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I'd just gotten off the
green tortoise coming from Eugene,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon, left my girlfriend, my dogs up
there to come to the city to make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it wasn't always easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really hard, actually, a lot of
times being on the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was a hard period.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cops were rough on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember a few of my friends were
missing when I got there who were in jail
[SPEAKER_03]: for selling weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so it was rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so this was like a shiny spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like, one of those moments that
when you're traveling around, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, fuck, man, what am I doing,
man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't make it another day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm in a park practically
homeless, you know, and where I'm on the
[SPEAKER_03]: road and I'm, you know, I can barely
afford gas to get to the next show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, I think it's time for me
to maybe go get a job or something and go
[SPEAKER_03]: back home right then.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something like this would
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like me and Gabby in a park or I can name
a million things where it's just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just gets you one more day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all you need is just one more
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to remember like, hey, I belong here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make this, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of those moments for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was contemplating wrapping it
up and maybe going home and trying to find
[SPEAKER_03]: a little easier way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, anyways, I sold all that weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I was done, you know,
Gabby expressed to me that he was very
[SPEAKER_03]: grateful and, you know, that he was
actually thinking about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was thinking about maybe he'd made a
mistake by coming to California and that
[SPEAKER_03]: he was hoping that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the quote was his I don't know
if it was you that told me this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a Grateful Dead, Grateful Dead dream
continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grateful Dead fantasy continue one more
day, you know, because he wanted to stay
[SPEAKER_03]: in the city and see Jerry Garcia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why he moved there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he expressed to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I can totally understand
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was there, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in saying that, he also he wanted
to show by his words, he wanted to show
[SPEAKER_03]: gratitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, listen, you know,
when you come to the work shows,
[SPEAKER_03]: I always get this one particular table in
the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get there at five a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you used to get there first in
line and just sit on Market Street all day
[SPEAKER_03]: long until, you know, six o'clock at night
when they open up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't exactly it wasn't exactly five a
.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more along the lines of two p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it would be like we would
compete with like it was like maybe 10
[SPEAKER_02]: people there that would always try to be
the first in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you know, it started off as
three o'clock and then somebody would show
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: At two forty five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, by the end of it,
we were showing up sometimes at like one p
[SPEAKER_02]: .m.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't like back in the day when we
used to wait for Grateful Dead tickets at
[SPEAKER_02]: like the ticket box office.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we would wait for the night before
or five in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to see Jerry, if you wanted to have
your spot, you had to show up like one or
[SPEAKER_02]: two o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was general mission on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so, you know, he said, I always get
the same table.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the thing I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're always welcome to come hang out
with me there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow, OK, yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so sure enough, I mean, it couldn't
have been too long for everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been that month.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember 1993 shows that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went to the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerry always came on stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say 20 to 8, you know,
730.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd make us wait for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I would come in and I came
in at like closer to eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the place is already shaking and
people are dancing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dreadlocks are swinging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what it was, but I looked
clear across the floor because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I went onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to seek on the floor instead of
being up in the balcony anyway and making
[SPEAKER_03]: the story too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I saw him some clear across the floor
in the dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: People dancing like crazy as they do with
these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's looking right at me and he and he
points to the chair next to me and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over you just to see to come on over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I go over there and, you know,
I sit down at the table and it's like the
[SPEAKER_03]: best seat in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best weed in the house for sure is
being smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this table became kind of
legendary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you had Bob Snodgrass and Maria
come down and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember smoking out of the dragon
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Dan Healy swung by at one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not to mention, like pretty much all
the good fucking indoor weed, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that made it to San Francisco for these
shows would somehow make it to this table.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people would stop by and it was
fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next night, the same thing and the
next night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then pretty much every night until
until Jerry, you know, kicked the bucket
[SPEAKER_03]: and said goodbye to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I hung out with Gabby at the at
the Warfield at his table and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a bar right in front of it and
just a few just a perfect view of the fat
[SPEAKER_03]: man up there and just rocking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I always tell people who weren't
around as I would give I would give like a
[SPEAKER_03]: right hand almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: For just one more night there,
you know, I don't really want to do that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Gabby feels the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more damn night at the Warfield,
I would do anything, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would at least give a stub of my finger
like like Jerry had lost his.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take a little piece of my finger
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be an easy trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me let me ask one quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there was some incredible
different samples of weed going across
[SPEAKER_00]: that table over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any particular standouts to
either of you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, mostly it would be Gabby's
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was the best at the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when other weed would show up,
it would be like, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: all those people I mentioned, they came by
because they knew that he had the good
[SPEAKER_03]: weed there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like if they were going to come
back behind the stage or make their way
[SPEAKER_03]: across that floor, you know, they were
going to they were going to come to that
[SPEAKER_03]: table.
[SPEAKER_03]: People just knew when the word got out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabby was always so generous.
[SPEAKER_03]: With his weed and like, you know,
always wanted to turn people on to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people did get turned on to it
and they swing by the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was one famous herb that I
don't think I used to get it at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Warfield, but I used to get it like on
Grateful Dead Tour on the West Coast that
[SPEAKER_02]: to this day, I can remember the taste and
the way it looked and was the Big Sur Holy
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the skunk and they had a haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them were out of this world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember like at the way I found
that weed was the family that was selling
[SPEAKER_02]: that herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to sell it a quarter ounce at a
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like one hundred and twenty
five bucks for a quarter ounce on on Dead
[SPEAKER_02]: Tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of similar to the stories that
you tell about the skunk and the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to just buy it all up, you know,
like they wanted to sell it as quarters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I didn't buy that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best weed ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then kind of similar to the story with
the chem dog is only family and friends
[SPEAKER_02]: would get that weed, you know,
because it was already too expensive and
[SPEAKER_02]: too rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this wasn't the type of weed that you
went and sold to random people that you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't know on the deadline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to share with your friends,
you know, and you would wait until you
[SPEAKER_03]: bumped into them, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You say you have no good memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember the Big Sur Holy Weed,
though you remember those two skunk and
[SPEAKER_03]: haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I bring that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just have holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I just have holes in my memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not complete.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I just want to a lot of
people are telling this story to the best
[SPEAKER_02]: of their ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that this is an issue of
like people are lying and making shit up
[SPEAKER_02]: and like, you know, not so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: He believes the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, how you realize you
made a mistake on something you said on
[SPEAKER_02]: the other podcast, like when I was teasing
you and make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what it's going to be like for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're dealing with
something that happened a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not so dog puts it, you know,
put it pretty clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us knew how important this history
was going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't keep detailed notes,
you know, and, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you or I or not so dog,
there's really nothing to benefit from the
[SPEAKER_02]: little mistakes that are being made or
discrepancies that are being made in these
[SPEAKER_02]: stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not like by saying this,
this person is going to make a have a big
[SPEAKER_02]: payday doesn't look like anyone trying to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I think we should have
healthy debate about what we think the
[SPEAKER_02]: story was and enjoy telling the stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, particularly if I enjoy listening to
the stories from you guys, because your
[SPEAKER_02]: memory, even if there's some mistakes,
it's so much more detailed than mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's for me, it's the most beautiful
thing to hear you tell the stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that we're able to even like
share the story, you know, because it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: miracle that any of this like it's like I
always tell people, you know, 30 years
[SPEAKER_03]: later, just from my viewpoint of all this,
it's it's like it's a unique thing to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to look back and kind of see the
whole thing, at least from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and just to watch he like kind
of appreciate like all the little twists
[SPEAKER_03]: and turns, all the little nudges in a
certain direction, you know, and to like
[SPEAKER_03]: it all just kind of seems like what the
hell is going on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it seems like like a divine
intervention almost, you know what it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant, you know, it has a divine
intervention.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely somehow works with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether we understand it or not,
we don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and, you know, it's amazing that,
you know, she's still here and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: different people and none of us knew each
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like so, you know, like Gabby knew Greg,
but I didn't I never even heard of the
[SPEAKER_03]: guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like all these little
details like if you take one little piece
[SPEAKER_03]: of it out, she may not make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're here still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get to talk to each other now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, now, you know, we all get to
know each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody who is involved with what
happened back then with this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: plan or a few plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, it's just like it's it's it's
it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult to explain it to someone to
give them the perspective that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like I or Gabby has,
you know, to see like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what's really going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, you know, this wasn't about
anything except for having the best
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no motivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, not so dog and Gabby,
you know, like he said, are correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, like, you know,
it's it's just to me, it's just amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can still tell the story,
you know, and that we can all talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: it amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us saw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like like those guys said,
like we weren't like none of this was part
[SPEAKER_03]: none of this was important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had no importance whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not one of us, you know, I know Gabby
and I, we didn't we never like even once
[SPEAKER_03]: considered like, you know, what's going to
happen 30 years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just like let's smoke the
best weed today and laugh and have a good
[SPEAKER_03]: time and go snowboarding or skiing and
watch Seinfeld like we used to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what it was all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's all so delicate in that sense,
you know, like nobody was trying to get to
[SPEAKER_03]: the finish line.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just trying to, you know,
have the best weed in our pocket,
[SPEAKER_03]: which we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that was what that maybe that's
how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant gives us what we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: We give the plant what it wants and look
at us all surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's I think that's still the
goal today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to quickly take us back a sec,
because I agree with Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing such a good job with this
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to quickly rewind a second and ask
Gabby a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about the France scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that a lot of people are
interested in, mostly because when that
[SPEAKER_00]: trade for the skunk eventually went down,
that was what those VA dudes were more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are sort of like,
why was it the France scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what was going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the first episode,
Jason said that it was sort of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd love to hear from Gabby,
like what was your take on the France
[SPEAKER_00]: scene in terms of like the flavor,
the effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you remember it?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I hope this story isn't
disappointing to everyone because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the ending isn't so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so the France scene was just bagged
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I had acquired on Grateful Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we could speculate that it was
Northern Lights just based on what we
[SPEAKER_02]: thought we knew, which was limited about,
you know, other stuff like that and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, photos we had seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was bagged seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and, you know, I think Nato Dog
mentioned this, you know, before and in
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the stuff that was done back
then, it was accidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, you know, you get a bag of
weed, you find a couple of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, you kept them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, most of the time, if I find bagged
seed, I don't keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unless it's like something truly
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I don't try to plant
accidents like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back then, that's all I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have access to clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was in a highly secretive New York
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so at the time, I didn't really
have anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what his I think that he goes by
Weasel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somebody named him Weasel,
which could be the only name that's worse
[SPEAKER_02]: than Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, I felt bad about Staten
Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found out they call him Weasel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, shit, this could have been
much worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was he was growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was growing some seed grown stuff that
that he had, you know, from bagged seed
[SPEAKER_02]: that he collected as well from like we
went to a dead show at RFK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if you guys heard of the
RFK, but he had the RFK one, two and
[SPEAKER_02]: three, three different females that he
kept from seed that he found there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I wanted to try to get
something else from seeds that I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been going to a lot more shows than
he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I I felt like I could maybe
find something nice out of my seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I did was I named every I named
every single one of my seeds a girl's
[SPEAKER_02]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, even this is prior to knowing what
their sex was, just as like positive
[SPEAKER_02]: affirmation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything had a girl's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so, you know, I had Francine,
I had Irene, you know, Michelle,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, you know, just like just because
I didn't want to name them one,
[SPEAKER_02]: two, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted it to be more personal than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I gave him my girl's names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Francine ended up being the best
of those seeds that I planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really I think partly what was
attractive to it was it was a very easy
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to put out really big,
chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time, you know, we were growing
organically and it was way hard to get
[SPEAKER_02]: those results.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hard to get really big,
chunky buds when you were growing organic
[SPEAKER_02]: in a container, particularly with the
limited knowledge that we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Francine was a really easy plant to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it had like a mildly fruity flash
hash plant type taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really impressive to look at,
you know, kind of like the market today,
[SPEAKER_02]: how the visual look is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, you know, I was able to sell
the Francine based on how it looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when I think about it compared to all
the other weed that we had gotten after
[SPEAKER_02]: and all the weed that we have today,
it's not on that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wish I had it just for,
you know, posterity and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to say I've had this strain for as long,
you know, but it really wasn't as good as
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else that we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it used to have a problem getting
moldy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so once I started having because
the buds was so dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so they're very wet away from
growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, now the best part of the story
about the Francine was that's how we got
[SPEAKER_02]: the chemdome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was so impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I can say his name because I just
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't know what his stage name
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to edit that shit out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't have the same name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the most paranoid motherfucker I've
ever met in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he doesn't even have a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, OK, we can just say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we could just say if that's his real
name, we could just say that my memory is
[SPEAKER_02]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real name probably isn't even.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you hear this, this is Jason.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been looking for you for 26 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you at?
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just outed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just outed you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see the look on his face if he
actually heard that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I got a fear for my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK, so something else about the
Francine was I used to have a bubbler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Snodgrass custom made a bubbler that
said Francine on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the only herb that I ever
smoked out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I stopped growing the Francine,
I stopped smoking out of that bubbler,
[SPEAKER_02]: never used it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily, one day I found some girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name was Francine and she was a
smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, you need to have
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I just gave it to her because her
name was Francine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, if not, it's just going to
sit in the drawer forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Francine can can use it forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That story encompasses why I just adore
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so fucking generous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like that pipe, you could have carried
that all the way and never spoke out of it
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people would have,
you know, it's part of their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to give it to someone like that,
that's I love that about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to hear something funny about
you saying how generous I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so dog in his previous podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said how stingy I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, I'm super stingy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was talking about he was talking about
the chem dog and he like mentioned it like
[SPEAKER_02]: three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, like, I just didn't give everybody
the chem dog, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I pointed out to him was I gave
it to my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to my group.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I gave it I gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to others, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, just because I didn't,
like, stand on a street corner peddling
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog clones doesn't mean like,
you know, I was stingy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said before, you know, I like to share
my weed and, you know, it puts it out to
[SPEAKER_02]: the universe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Staten Island's a stingy motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's so many incredible details
around this short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to quickly check in on a few of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if Jason said it earlier,
but when you guys had that initial first
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting, did you have any chem dog with
you at that time or not yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that you asked this question
because in the previous podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason said that I had a little chem dog
during this encounter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like when I was listening to it,
I texted Jason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you're a motherfucking liar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, basically, I was just
making a point that, like, it's possible
[SPEAKER_02]: for any of us to get this story wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jason made a mistake when he was
telling the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that I had the chem dog when
we first met.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is I got the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: After going to New York and I got the VA
skunk and I traded the skunk for the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure what year it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 93, like you said earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so like Jason's connection to
getting the chem dog is pretty crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he likes to give me all the
credit, but I can turn it around and give
[SPEAKER_02]: him the credit because chem dogs you know,
he would not have given me the chem dog if
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have something he really wanted
like the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wanted to quickly ask you about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, firstly, how did you meet Greg?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a follow up, was he holding
out because he knew the chem dog was so
[SPEAKER_00]: good and he wanted to trade or was he just
like a recluse dude and just didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: trade?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he was willing to trade just not the
chem dog because he knew it was super
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable that he was the only one had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I lived in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was mostly working it on the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he didn't see me as much of a threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, because when I lived in New
York, he didn't want to give it to us,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you meet him through Klopp and that
or did you manage to meet him some other
[SPEAKER_00]: way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him through Klopp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like that's another thing is like
people discount Weasel or Klopp's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, placing all of this,
you know, I know they do, but like if it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't for Klopp, I don't meet chem dog
and none of this happens either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because like, you know,
people give you Jason and Klopp shit
[SPEAKER_02]: saying like they're making up this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and, you know, it's like he was he was
critical in me getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so were you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I didn't have the skunk, Greg was being
tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg was the one that was fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg was being stingy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to have something to trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't going to just give it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, finally, when I had something
that good to trade, he did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've ever even told me
this, but do you remember the first time
[SPEAKER_03]: you ever smoked chem dog?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was with chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was with a G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it like before you moved out or before
you moved out?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I had moved out already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had moved out in 91 and that's when I
first got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like on a visit to New York or,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was it like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was he was he growing it really good back
then or was he still figuring it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I hate to throw people under the bus,
but like his grow set up in my view was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty pathetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I mean, he had this garden
called the Emily's garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, it's a brief fabricated hydroponic
garden, which is just like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: reservoir with a lid on top with like four
holes for like baskets or rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just like have a air stone in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, and that's how he was
growing the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one part of the story that I like to
tell us, he called it the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to say, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow it organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time, I was the biggest organic
snob there was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if you would have given me
a pound of hydroponically grown weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the best ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just like turn my nose to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was I was just snob.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I tried to grow it organic and we
did grow it organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it barely survived before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like almost dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time it was time to cut it,
you know, it's such a hard plant to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and I told this story on the
other podcast, too, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: important for me, at least I had this
moment where I read something in a
[SPEAKER_02]: pamphlet from a company that was selling
hydroponic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I said is organics are mineral
compounds that contain carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And need to be broken down into their more
common mineral form before they can be
[SPEAKER_02]: uptaken by the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And minerals are the building blocks of
all life on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I read that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, shit, like maybe I should
try growing using mineral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did and I never turned back,
you know, so now I believe, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're growing in a container indoors
or outdoors and you're trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: organic, you got your work cut out for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, I don't think you get as
good of a quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I add organics to my mineral
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll add some seaweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll add some other organic additives.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the base of what my plants eat is
mineral nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a big thing right
now where people are trying to do living
[SPEAKER_02]: soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, this is no till indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, bro, that's just like what a
stupid thing to say, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense, you know, to the like really,
you know, popular growers that are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thing that you don't till indoors,
like how are you going to fucking get that
[SPEAKER_02]: tiller indoors anymore?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to quickly ask you before I forget
in the first episode, Jason was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how when you were growing
organically, you had like these really
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of cutting edge methods for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was it, the vat, like the living
compost tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about that quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cutting edge and crude at the very
same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I used to have a couple of
trash cans that I would fill up with
[SPEAKER_02]: organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'd be one that would be for guanos,
you know, to make guanos teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would have some seaweed in it and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my logic was I never let it get more
than half empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always being aerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I thought like it was kind of like
a starter for like yeast, like for
[SPEAKER_02]: sourdough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get rid of it because that's
what you got all that life in that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you always want to just like do it
halfway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would literally keep this vat going
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I moved from one location to
another, I would like take the starter
[SPEAKER_02]: with me, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing that I tried
doing, which was super disgusting,
[SPEAKER_02]: was in another vat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to do this outside eventually
because it was so fucking gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put food scraps in the water and,
you know, just aerate it and agitate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would water that to my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty disgusting stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I when I started scooping one
teaspoon per gallon of mineral fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people like hydroponics,
that's just so dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you think so?
[SPEAKER_02]: You should see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like fucking blast pneumonia,
like if the if the pump, if the aerating
[SPEAKER_03]: pump would die for you, the power outage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Gabby's same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing you think about is that
because it would just be a matter of hours
[SPEAKER_03]: before you start to smell the decay of
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew that because I would take my
hair and stir it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabby taught me this, and this is what I
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it worked amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like sometimes I'm like, wait,
I should do that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would take my hair and stir it up
because it would be a lot of sediment on
[SPEAKER_03]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you know, if you like,
you know, how you're working, you always
[SPEAKER_03]: got little cuts on your fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would get like infected in seconds
and like get all red.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, oh, shit, the vat's hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ready to feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always take half the trash can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, hey, Gabby, remember the
other day I told you about your buddy who
[SPEAKER_03]: took that horticulture class with you in
Santa Rosa?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the second thing he mentioned was
the vat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention that before how we
were talking about how small world it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you run into one of my college buddies
when you're just around.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a crazy small world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a small world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I bring us back for one second?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that point about how, Gabby,
you mentioned that, you know, in a sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem dog coming out to the East Coast
could equally be attributed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to Skunk V8 or Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember in that first interview I
did with him, he made a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you know, this guy was really
impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was a real good networker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I just want to sort of confirm
because it sounds pretty impressive that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you were able to mastermind this
plan to get the chem dog through the Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had you been thinking about, like,
how can I get this chem dog off Greg for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while or was it just like a spur of the
moment thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg didn't want to give it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he didn't want to give it up.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then run us through how the trade went
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it all go down logistically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I don't have the exact details of
like, I don't remember the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation that made it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think Jason got it a little bit
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it doesn't like change any of
the story at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was our buddy that we're not
supposed to say his name from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about we how about we call him
not so does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: That works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call him not so I think that's way
funnier.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came out to see Jerry at the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when Jason introduced me to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He saw the Francine and was interested in
trading the Francine for the Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I do believe we were also always
trying to get the Beatrix choice,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I don't think we actually ever got.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so he wanted the Francine and he
wanted to trade for the Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somehow I arranged to trade the
Skunk with Greg for for the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I went first to New York City,
where I met not so and and traded him the
[SPEAKER_02]: Francine for the Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe he gave me a couple of
clones, which I took up to Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_02]: and I traded one of them for I think I got
a couple of clones of the chem dog from G.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did leave one with Klopp because again,
if it wasn't for him, none of this
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I drove west and I told the story
on the other podcast as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it in a Burger King Cup with a lid,
two Burger King cups, one with the Skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: and one with the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was driving down the road,
if a truck was coming by or if I was
[SPEAKER_02]: scared of police, I just put the lid on
the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that wasn't happening,
you know, it was getting sunlight through
[SPEAKER_02]: the front window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like whatever light I could give
it in the hotel room to get that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: across country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's the short story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you want to ask any more
questions for me to make it more detailed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I got one last quick question and
then I want to start talking some more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I heard mixed reports about some
people say, oh, you know, Weasel was the
[SPEAKER_00]: head of that New York crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other people are like,
no, it was JJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was sort of the head honcho in your
eyes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, you know, I certainly wasn't the
head honcho because I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and JJ, he used to buy the weed
from Klopp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was prior to him growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, JJ was the connect to get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I don't think any of us ever
thought of us as the the leader or the
[SPEAKER_02]: kingpin, you know, but but Klopp or Weasel
was the one that, you know, started all
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff getting grown on Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned before, he should probably be
called Staten Island because he lived
[SPEAKER_02]: there longer than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever, at this point, I'm going to
embrace this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody nobody would try to take that name
away from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he also gave it to a couple of our
Staten Island friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if I had to answer your
question, I would say, yeah, it was Weasel
[SPEAKER_02]: that was really responsible for all that
growing on Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the first person that I ever
saw growing cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I can tell you that story briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one that I told on this other
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So me and my it's like an old girlfriend
that I had at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're literally sitting outside of a
subway station on Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a few like, you know,
trains on Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had just like come back from,
I think, seeing a dead show at the garden
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're like sitting on the street,
like on the curb, smoking weed right
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the train station.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Weasel's like, hey, what are you doing
down there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, oh, it's like you're
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, yeah, it's like,
oh, well, come up here and smoke it with
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like he smelled some good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't used to seeing weed like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, like, I believe that was the first
time he ever encountered kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we showed him this weed that we
were getting on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, this shit's grown indoors
like you can grow this indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the point where he got
inspired to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember like he first like dropped
a couple of seeds in a 10 gallon fish tank
[SPEAKER_02]: and his cat used to dig it up all the
time, you know, before he like made it
[SPEAKER_02]: like more secure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he eventually was growing with
just normal T5, not T5, like T8,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the regular fat tube fluorescence in
his closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time, even though
we had gotten kind of an indoor on tour,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the first time I ever saw indoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the moment like, you know,
I inspired him to start it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he inspired me to like stopping a
gypsy to get a house where I could grow
[SPEAKER_02]: weed too.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and so that's when I got an apartment
in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I grew my first weed,
because I was inspired by Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about you got the skunk to
California and you harvested it the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear both of you guys' opinions
slash recollections of what was that first
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk crop like when it was your own
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to this day, to this day,
people call me up or message me and ask me
[SPEAKER_02]: about that weed and tell me that it was
some of the best weed ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a very respected breeder out here,
his name is Shiloh, and he has a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: company called Shiloh Massive Genetic So I
have I have some of his genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was doing some nursery work
and I have some of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked him, I was like, hey,
do you want copies of this stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just sent him a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to know, like, hey, I've got some
of your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you if you still have it
if you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his response to me is, do you have any
of that VA skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, like, no, I was like and I
said to him, I was like, you heard the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast that just done this other podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, no, that was just the
best weed I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think we all I think we all
had that same, you know, the same feeling
[SPEAKER_02]: about that herb is that that was some of
the best weed we ever smoked in our life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to grow it was way better than
growing the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was you have to remember,
like we weren't that skilled growers like
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason earlier said, you know, it was the
best indoor weed he ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there wasn't a lot of really good
indoor being grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a lot of knowledge on how to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a pretty, pretty new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think about it now,
like a lot of the shit that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's amazing that we got the
results we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, it was it was it was like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's super strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number six.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it's hard to it's hard to like
explain to someone these days,
[SPEAKER_03]: like how amazing it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's difficult, especially when they
start talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, this stuff was more
skunky than skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was it was it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and the high was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it wasn't it was like it wasn't
it wasn't very strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it wasn't overpowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chem dog was like, you know,
I can't I'm just going to stare at the
[SPEAKER_03]: lawns rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the super skunk was what you
smoked all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do your thing, go do your
errand.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, run to the store, whatever you
got to do, you know, but the flavor and
[SPEAKER_03]: the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the thing that the super
skunk and the chem dog and probably many
[SPEAKER_03]: other strands, but at least those two have
in common is like every single time you
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke, you got stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was something about it where you
couldn't really build a tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were smoking balling heads,
butlers and fatties of the shit all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every single time it just hits you
just right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like there's a lot of herb like
that, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's not a lot of herbs that
just hit you just right every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and chem dog is definitely on
that list.
[SPEAKER_03]: And super skunk was too, and I wish that,
you know, more people could enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was all about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just gave you a lot of big odor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it did stretch out a lot like
the sour diesel does, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: sticks of weed, you know, just tons of
sticks and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there was two iterations
of the super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us about the first one,
the original chem dog cross super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they come about and what were
those seeds like when you grew them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was many iterations of the
super dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there were many, you know,
we were trying or what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was me and not so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to make crosses that had
chem dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we tried to cross
everything we had, hoping that we could
[SPEAKER_02]: get, I mean, we obviously, you know,
we wouldn't have crossed it with
[SPEAKER_02]: everything we had if we didn't want
diversity.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet we really wanted something that
had chem traits and that grew better than
[SPEAKER_02]: the chem dog because it was such a
difficult plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had gotten seeds from Sensi and we
had gotten the super skunk from Sensi
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the fact that the VA skunk was so
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt like this is the best thing,
you know, to buy from Sensi in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: cross with the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what year this was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do know that there's been a bunch of
confusion over whether like what we made
[SPEAKER_02]: to cross the super dog with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like at the time I was dead set
against using any seeds that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: although, you know, everything we did was
made from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never germinate purposefully
something that I knew that was grown like
[SPEAKER_02]: from a herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to buy seeds from Holland
because we wanted true, a true male that
[SPEAKER_02]: we could cross with the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the super skunk was the obvious
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to get that shit bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's how we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got the seeds from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sensi seeds, you couldn't count
on many things, but one thing you could
[SPEAKER_02]: count on is if you bought the super skunk,
that shit looked exactly like the catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to like grow the flower and then
hold the Sensi seed catalog up against the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds and be like, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we crossed those males with the dog
and everything else we had many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried to do inbreeding with the chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first time, you know, we did it,
you know, we called the super dog and then
[SPEAKER_02]: we crossed it back to the dog again and
did it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did it three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, the skunk genetics was so
dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our knowledge of selection was so
limited that I never got anything that was
[SPEAKER_02]: like what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was a ton of great things
that, you know, the stuff was nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it wasn't I never produced what I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I quickly ask?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the the very first iteration of
the super dog seeds was the VA skunk onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I incorrect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it actually the first iteration was
just the Sensi seeds and it never had the
[SPEAKER_00]: VA skunk in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabby, what he's asking about is when you
made the seeds when you were over at a
[SPEAKER_03]: water trough, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I answered that question already when I
said I wouldn't do a herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the the super skunk, the VA skunk that
we had was a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do what I considered
legitimate breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, breeding with seeds that could
potentially have hermaphroditic traits
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't legitimate breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to get ourselves males from a
reliable source in order to make any of
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted males to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like this part, you know,
who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Gab, when you were over at water
troughs, you may not totally remember this
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was kind of a blip in your,
you know, like in your timeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you actually had some NL five hay
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know exactly what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably purchased that at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this was like 1997.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you you had what happened is you had
bought those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You crossed them with either the chem dog
or either the super skunk, the number six.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember which one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you took them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You found a male in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you did this pretty quick,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that was the one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking back now, knowing what I know,
I'm like, damn, that happened quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you crossed that back with the
chem doc.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we started calling that super doc.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very small amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really know what you did with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I remember is that one time you went
out of town and you would harvest these.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first reason I remember it so clearly
is because it was the first time I'd ever
[SPEAKER_03]: seen, you know, cannabis right from seed,
you know, and you had that cardboard box
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and you harvest it and you were
called super super dog, like super skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they definitely had that NL five Hayes
because we discussed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember sitting in your bedroom in that
bathroom where you grew weed and where you
[SPEAKER_03]: showed me the pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we looked at we actually
had some pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a catalog, I think, or I don't
know how we saw the pictures, but we
[SPEAKER_03]: looked at pictures and you discussed it
with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you do you, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_03]: But and then the only thing I remember is
when we harvested that or you harvested
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you went out of town and you asked me
to go over to the cardboard box and box
[SPEAKER_03]: everything up, you know, like put it in
tuckwares.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on the lines drying in that box.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fucking dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was a nice blend of super
super skunk and chem dog actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I wasn't familiar with the
NL five Hayes then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I don't I can't in my
memory, I don't remember seeing much of
[SPEAKER_03]: that in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think all that happened to
probably, you know, I'm pretty sure that I
[SPEAKER_02]: did get NL seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember getting the super skunk
seeds because the thing is the NL seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: were almost like an afterthought because,
hey, if we're going to go order seeds from
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam, we're not just going to order
one pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the super skunk was the like main
thing that we wanted, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we picked up some other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Memory is a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the way I remember the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it sounds like you guys did
a lot, a lot more extensive work when you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys started working with those sensei
seeds, super skunk seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I did a lot of this stuff with
Francis or not sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because he had a whole bunch of genetics,
you know, he had the Mendo perps,
[SPEAKER_02]: he had the Maui, he had a ton of shit that
we cross when we did this, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was the one that I remember coming
up with the name not so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he reminded me of this when we
talked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why the shit we call the
shit not so dog, the original ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: we called them the SD, the super dog,
the original SD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then after doing it again,
you know, one day, Francis says,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we got to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The not so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me, how long were you growing the
original Skunk 6, the VA Skunk 4,
[SPEAKER_00]: before you lost it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Jason might know better than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that so well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess you would say, if you got it
in, you must have got it in 1993.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we can go back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's fuck your name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think not so much funnier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make sure we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, where's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's not so loved it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend died in 2002.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I saw him was at the
funeral.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we felt like there was law
enforcement there and there was reason for
[SPEAKER_03]: law enforcement to be in my friend's
funeral and saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the last time I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's never heard from again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never saw him again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so the one that came out,
but also that night when I don't know what
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys talked about, I wasn't part of
the discussion, obviously, but there was
[SPEAKER_03]: some other rovers from the night where you
guys talked about trading, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like talking about Superstar.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was there, but I wasn't part of the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but there was some other characters
there from Virginia who were kind of more
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, not Kingpin, like you guys
call it, but like more more control those
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts than was, you know, kind of like the
guy who can maybe get the cuts,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those were the ones that were keeping
holding the cuts and they were there,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so that's why I was so
surprised by all this, because I I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: even know those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: I acted like I don't know who they were,
because I knew that would make them more
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I grew up smoking their weed in
Virginia, you know, the weed they actually
[SPEAKER_03]: brew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they actually asked to ask you,
you know, about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they were there there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually asked you and then they
actually asked me as a fucking kid what I
[SPEAKER_03]: thought about it, because that's just how
people are from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how those guys were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, dude, it's none of my
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just want to hang out with the
good weed, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's how it all went down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They agreed to to share that cut,
you know, to give Gabby that cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess they would have gotten a cut
of that France, at least I hope they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so we had it from that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabby had it from that point on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he passed it to me in 1995,
just right before Jerry Garcia died,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like to July of 1995,
when I came up to Sonoma County and got
[SPEAKER_03]: the house up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he told me he would set me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you when you quit going to see Jerry,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you quit, Jerry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you decided you don't want to see
Jerry no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, we talked about that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you meant, what you were saying was
is because you used to always be like you
[SPEAKER_03]: were hard on the vents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, everybody was, you know,
but you're a little bit older than me,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was easier for you to be in this
position, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said to me, it's like,
you know, Jake, Jason, when this whole
[SPEAKER_03]: grateful when you're done with this whole
Grateful Dead thing, let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to hook you up with some
clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you what I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll get you growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you told me that you were like
fulfilling my big dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know, you know, the whole thing
is like Grateful Dead tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all the whole thing is like,
you know, I want to grow my own weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: sell some weed out of the, you know,
my house and I'm growing, you know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of grow the best weeds,
you know, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the big dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, we lost the superstar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't really know, it's easy to remember,
like an event that's catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to remember, like the events
that led up to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do admit that I have a hard time
admitting or not a minute remembering why
[SPEAKER_03]: like what had happened up to the point
where the story so you had an outlet,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was right left your toaster oven in
your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're having a lot of trouble with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was causing problems in other circuits
in the house, not necessarily your grow
[SPEAKER_03]: room, but like, you know, your living
circuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're like, your laundry room in your
kitchen, and you're using a vacuum to suck
[SPEAKER_03]: water out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're convinced that the water that
you kept getting out of it has something
[SPEAKER_03]: to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, eventually, you know,
you had me look at it, and I wasn't an
[SPEAKER_03]: electrician yet, but I knew a thing or
two, I couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you had to call the landlord.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the landlord had to call an
electrician.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also had to come over and check
it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, you had to take down
your grow room, you had to kind of box up
[SPEAKER_03]: your grow room, and you had to box up your
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The part I don't remember is how is it
that we only had one mother of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I don't think we really
coordinated, like, like super like
[SPEAKER_03]: organized on who had what mothers to make
sure we lose it, we didn't really think
[SPEAKER_03]: about it much, you know, we just knew we
both had it because me and Gabby,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was an emergency situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not it was an emergency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had been going on for like a week,
and it had become a bigger emergency,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh, shoot, we got to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's hard for people to
understand these days, it's kind of hard
[SPEAKER_03]: for me to even express it or anybody
probably like how stressful a situation
[SPEAKER_03]: like this can be, you know, because of the
way things are now compared to this could
[SPEAKER_03]: like wreck your whole deal, you know,
this could be like the end for you,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least that's our perception,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he had to put that thing in a box
or along with all his other mothers and
[SPEAKER_03]: probably had to, I don't remember this,
but knowing him, he probably had a crop
[SPEAKER_03]: going and he probably had to chop some
shit down, you know, and toss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the moms went a box and I don't know
exactly what happened, but that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: the super skunk died.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, I want to say 1997 or 1998,
but I'm, I'm like more like 82% or 89%
[SPEAKER_03]: sure it was actually 1998.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: We lost it right then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had passed it to someone at Humboldt
County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those people are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're up in White Thorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, shouldn't say that in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, the guy I gave it to passed it
to his neighbor and his neighbor was a
[SPEAKER_03]: friend of mine now, but at the time she
was like super duper private person and
[SPEAKER_03]: you couldn't, you know, like she didn't
come over and hang out when the one you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, anybody besides her neighbor was
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he passed it to her and you know,
we, we thought we had it for a little
[SPEAKER_03]: while after we lost it probably in early
2000s, we thought we had it on it down
[SPEAKER_03]: when me and her became friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we lost it because she had passed
someone back in Assoma County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she set up a meeting between me
and him and he had lost it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and that was the end of it,
but it was 1998 and that was the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you know, and it was a bummer,
you know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me say, let me say something real
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you reminded me of this
story earlier today and it kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: brought light to something that,
you know, maybe it's going to be upsetting
[SPEAKER_02]: to some people, including not so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to talk to him about it,
but so, you know, he asked me when I did
[SPEAKER_02]: the podcast, he said, well, you know,
was it the, the sensey skunk or the VA
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, I don't remember,
you know, like I hadn't been thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so now when Jason's reminding me of
this, what I'm realizing is that what I
[SPEAKER_02]: must have given Francis and bred with,
I know that we bred with it was the sensey
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, not the VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Francis never had the VA skunk
because I had lost it prior to ever
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting him.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to say is this doesn't make
Francis a liar.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, like you like, you know,
a bunch of trolls on the internet are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to, you know, you're like,
Oh, Francis was lying about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, it doesn't make Francis a liar.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just, you know, mistaken about
something that happened so many fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, I call him,
he knew, he knew, yeah, he knew that we
[SPEAKER_02]: had the connection and you know,
I'm going to go and talk to those guys and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe do another podcast with them where
me and Francis talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he has no incentive to make shit
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, it doesn't benefit him in any
way to say that it was the VA skunk and
[SPEAKER_02]: not the sensey seed skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so so many people get so
worked up about this shit and I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why does, you know, maybe I could
understand Francis caring and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: caring and I'm caring, but like all these
people getting so worked up and calling
[SPEAKER_02]: people liars and fakes and that they don't
really know Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy nonsense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the truth is your
perspective into your perspective is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, larger and or different,
you know, and so that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, I mean, of course,
you know, like nobody here is trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's what these conversations,
that's what these conversations do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what these conversations do,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They change their perspective a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like maybe me, you and Francis,
you know, talking together on a podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's the best, you know,
I have no tension with them at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want the super skull bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't actually care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got, we got, we got, we got to,
we have to, we have to give up on that one
[SPEAKER_02]: and just make sure that we never lose the
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone now I've seen some
stuff that looks similar, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so maybe it has enough of the traits in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, with some of your,
your quality selection, maybe we can find
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that reminds us of it more,
but you know, yeah, that's the best we can
[SPEAKER_03]: do folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, there's no disagreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just perspective, you know,
of course, like it's nice to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about it and hear like, like,
like, make it make sense, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, from my perspective,
because I, you know, like these things are
[SPEAKER_03]: just plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, they are just plants,
but they're not just like, they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: possessions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're allies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, they're like my dog,
my cat, my kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's family to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to find out a member of my family's out
there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been missing that member all
these years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is going to affect you if you
have that kind of love.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, or you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, but as you work through
it, you understand it, like, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's obviously some more stuff here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not, you know, make, you know,
it's going to make sense to me at some
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it does, you know, and that's
good, you know, not that it's important
[SPEAKER_03]: and it makes sense to me, but it is to me,
you know, because like, that's how I go to
[SPEAKER_03]: bed at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, I remember what happened
and like, it's a shame what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also a learning time,
a learning, like a lesson point in my
[SPEAKER_03]: life, because that's why we don't lose
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably don't lose anything else
because of what happened there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how I took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I, and you took it that way
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, you know, it was a rough
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The VA skunk is to us what, like the
previous generation to us, they used to
[SPEAKER_02]: say, Oh, I remember back in the day,
there was the Colombian gold and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Panama red.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like this is the Panama red of
our lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that famous weed that got away.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like years later, years later,
people like Shiloh go, that was the best
[SPEAKER_02]: weed I ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of great weed
around, but if that one still rolls around
[SPEAKER_03]: your head, I mean, that tells you
everything you need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more years that go by,
the more it says, you know, cause it was
[SPEAKER_03]: that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: People just don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when people like, Oh, it's so stunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I want to believe it, but I also
roll my eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm like, you just, you know,
it's like now they have roadkill skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: scum spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all these different ways of
describing skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then it was simple skunk because
that's what it smelled like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, however it happened,
it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I, for one, I'm grateful to have
been over doing it and kind of remember
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, everything that I
come across in my life, including anything
[SPEAKER_03]: I make or anything that I enjoy,
you know, mentally these days,
[SPEAKER_03]: it always is going to get compared to
that, you know, cause it's hard not to and
[SPEAKER_03]: so unique, you know, so, and the guy who
made this number six, I just talked to
[SPEAKER_03]: him, you know, yesterday and the day
before, and he heard your podcast and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, you know, he was, he reached out
to me and he's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this guy, he got some cool stories,
but they don't have any of the backstory,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I know, you know,
and I, and I told him, Gabby, I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Hey, I'm one more closer to my,
uh, to one of my fantasies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I use the word fantasy,
but it is kind of, and he said,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I want you, me and Gabby to sit
down and smoke a joint and talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went, we, he's like, we can make that
happen at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an unknown legend as they say,
you know, and, uh, you know, that might
[SPEAKER_03]: change.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on it, but he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means a lot to me, just like you do,
Gavin, you know, his, his work needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: be, you know, it should be, you know,
kind of recognized, you know, cause he
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't doing it for the fucking fame of
the money either believe that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in the late eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was just like, Gabby and I just
trying to have the best fucking weed in
[SPEAKER_03]: his pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a quick moment to sort of ask a quick
question, which is, Oh, there's someone
[SPEAKER_01]: else here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's someone else here besides Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason and I were having a private
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel at all vindicated that
essentially the goal of what you were
[SPEAKER_00]: going for with the superdog is essentially
the genetic combination that led to sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel as far as we can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have the sour diesel conversation
in a second, but what I was going for was
[SPEAKER_02]: something that had the structure and the
vigor of the skunk with the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile of the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when, uh, not so dog talked
about it in his podcast, he was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we were looking for was the high
because the chem dog was the most potent
[SPEAKER_02]: weed of its day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I disputed that, I said,
what I wanted was shit that tasted like
[SPEAKER_02]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've always been like,
you know, the potency is nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if the weed that good, I want to hit
it twice anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd rather, I'd rather smoke
more of something that tastes like the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog than be concerned about whether
it was 15, 20 or 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still feel the same today.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the skunk, uh, excuse me,
the sour diesel, what I believe the sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel was, was an accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dental cross that Klopp made,
you know, I don't believe that it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding project or weasel, you know,
and, you know, we can talk to him about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but I didn't make it, you know,
and it was out there East with,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, JJ and AJ and, um, weasel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's, you know,
kind of why I assume it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's just my best guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think it is, but we'll have
to get weasel and JJ on the podcast and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we'll see what they have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they really were more there at the
beginning than I was with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, you know, the way,
you know, individuals speculate about what
[SPEAKER_03]: a strain is nowadays when they have no way
to like, you know, there's no evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just speculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, if you look at the super skunk
and you taste the Kim dog and you taste
[SPEAKER_03]: super skunk, and then you just try the
sour diesel, it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, you know, evolve the speculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one that I would agree with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is that that is probably true.
[SPEAKER_03]: The super skunk and the Kim dog,
since those guys were growing into both of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we both know the Kim dog herms every
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the super skunk certainly do bananas
too early.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you even had the slightest,
uh, lightly, you know, well-documented me
[SPEAKER_03]: and people talked about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, it's pretty, it doesn't take
like a large jump of your imagination and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, yeah, that probably is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it came from that area at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, who wants to get involved
with that conversation argument or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like a lot of people, a lot of people,
a lot of people are spending their life
[SPEAKER_02]: having that conversation and arguing about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be speculation to the end of
time, you know, and that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people go, which headband cut
did you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a, you know, master cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush cut users.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would love to answer you that,
but when someone hands you a cut and says,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the master Kush, I'm, I'm supposed
to add on another, you know, adjective or
[SPEAKER_03]: pronoun for you, for the, for somebody out
there on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what it's told to me is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand there's more than one cut of
headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand there's more than one cut of
master Kush, but when someone hands that
[SPEAKER_03]: to you, you know, you know, obviously
you're basing your experience with this
[SPEAKER_03]: cut in the past, which I do, I'm not going
to rename it, you know, just to suit
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how they feel about it,
you know, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what difference does it make?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I might, I don't mean to be an
asshole, but sometimes I ask the question
[SPEAKER_03]: back, how many sour diesels have you
smoked?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, well, I've smoked this
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, so what difference does it make
to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked one, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep it as true as it was when it was
handed to you, you know, like leave the
[SPEAKER_03]: speculation out, you know, cause that's
all it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you, if your game is speculation,
be really clear that that's what you do is
[SPEAKER_03]: speculate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that, I think that's a
legitimate thing to do is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speculate as long as that's the way we're
putting it and not putting too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, into it, you know, and there
certainly shouldn't be like heavy drama
[SPEAKER_02]: and arguments over it because we should
just be saying, yeah, I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just my best guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to ask, did either of you
guys ever really get into or try any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other clones to come out of G's
library?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, the G's or the snow dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of that work was done by
Bundy, but did you guys ever try
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in it at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown the G's out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's meant to be the same genetic
combo as sour diesel, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to be like Chem D skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I can't imagine anyone would put
it on that same level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, not many people have tried the
number six, but, um, it just didn't do it
[SPEAKER_03]: for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was standalone, but it's,
it goes back to perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when your perspective is,
Oh, this says super skunk in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, your, your expectations in some
areas have risen without you even wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: it to your bias has risen without your,
any, you know, effort on your part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore it becomes disappointing,
you know, unfortunately, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just like the mass super skunk,
which I've told you about before,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I got that sent to me and,
you know, I grew it out when you gave it
[SPEAKER_03]: to me in 2006 and I was expecting the
number six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what I told it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he said it would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, and I believe he thought that
that's what it was, but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, who knows maybe in some
gardens, it would have been a winner,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in my garden, it was just like a point
of disappointment, like a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: disappointment, you know, like so couldn't
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you, Gabby?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever try either of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, but what I did try were the
other cams like the chem sister and the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem D and I never thought any of that
stuff actually matched up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a matter of fact, like I told the
story, you know, with Francis that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really believe that, and I'm saying this
with all due respect, to Greg who produced
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the most important genetics of our
lifetime.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when he says that like five years
later, he popped more seeds from the same
[SPEAKER_02]: batch and then five years later,
he, you know, I question that because like
[SPEAKER_02]: he only had like 10 or 12 seeds initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you had 12 seeds of the most epic
shit ever, and you just pulled the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog out of it and you lost the chem dog,
which he did, would you wait five years?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then five years more to plant those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that doesn't seem like a logical
story, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing that chem dogs have said
many times that he called the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever he was growing at the time,
you know, so I really don't think that
[SPEAKER_02]: those are actually close chem crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have the chem dog in it
somewhere, kind of like the not so dog or
[SPEAKER_02]: the keeper dog, but um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that's what we were all
looking for at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would say I can't disagree with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I can't, you know, like the chem D
doesn't look anything like the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, of course there's variation in
F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most controversial shit that I
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most controversial shit that I
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it's not really conscious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just said it's your opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not controversial.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, you, you, you are
standalone too, and you get to have your
[SPEAKER_03]: own opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've had a lot of experience with these
stuff, you know, just like myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, I would agree with
you, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've told the story a dozen times where,
you know, like I saw the chem sister,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one that I wanted in a magazine
picture, you know, in 2006, that's the one
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chem sister I hold currently is not
the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it was handed to me as the chem
sis, so I still call it the chem sis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everybody wants to call it the Bundy
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I kind of know the stack story a
little bit on that, but I still just call
[SPEAKER_03]: it the chem sis, you know, um,
but the chem D and especially the chem
[SPEAKER_03]: one, two, and three, four, they don't,
I don't know, you know, they're definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: like, well, definitely in my opinion,
I would say they're probably related,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not directly related as in the same
project as the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we'll never know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just probably not, probably not to,
to get a bit of a baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you both, how did,
when, when OG Kush first came out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in sort of the early two
thousands, how did that change your
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you still think that like the chem dog
was the best shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you think like, oh, this OG really
stands up to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how did that change things?
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely felt like OG stood up to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's in the same, you know,
like range of profile, I guess might be a
[SPEAKER_03]: way to put it that I am attracted to,
you know, as the chem dog, like that deep
[SPEAKER_03]: earthy, a lot of pain, pain, you know,
a lot of like sort of similar turps,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, similar effects, you know,
I was pleasantly surprised to find out
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, Kim dog wasn't the only
good weed around, you know, I was happy to
[SPEAKER_03]: hear that, you know, so that's my take on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way my, my take on it is pretty
similar is I wish that I had made that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit because that's what I was trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to make shit that was similar
to the chem dog, but more robust plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're it, you know, and, you know,
I remember, look, I don't think I was
[SPEAKER_02]: stingy, but I did keep the chem dog close
to the vest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it got, when it got out,
I was a little bummed at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now when I think about it,
I'm grateful for that because because it
[SPEAKER_02]: got out a lot of great shit was made,
you know, not just from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason and the others that have read with
the chem dog, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of people got it, however they got it
and made some of the strains that I think
[SPEAKER_02]: are my favorite shit, you know,
till today, you know, so like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time I was a little upset when the
shit got, you know, completely out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, you know, now I don't even have
the chem dog, you know, I know I can get
[SPEAKER_02]: it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jason and, and others, but I'm
grateful it got out, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's kind of my perspective on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got the chem dog from Gabby,
he told me never give this to anyone ever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and so I did give it to three
people, a couple of them more than once,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, one of them a lot more than
once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm grateful for that,
you know, and I didn't, I, the third
[SPEAKER_03]: person I gave it to, I barely knew,
and he's probably the number one reason
[SPEAKER_03]: why it's everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, breeding or just clones
available, you know, so, and it's still
[SPEAKER_03]: hard to find, of course, but his name is
Shade Bud and he runs a company called 707
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was a little high on acid one night
and he came by the apartment to buy us
[SPEAKER_03]: some weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we started talking about breeding and
I was like, man, this motherfucker knows a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot about breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, I had this notion just
to give him the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, I want to say 2006,
come in 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never really saw the guy again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we talked on the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but anyway, so that's, and then it
went from there to Humboldt County,
[SPEAKER_03]: which they spread amongst their circles
far and wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually it went to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then a guy there gave it to Peabod
and then he was responsible for,
[SPEAKER_03]: for spreading it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peabod, Gab, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know who he is again?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the guy that sold the weed to Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of the guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he, he, he was, uh, coming back into
cannabis at the time, I guess you could
[SPEAKER_03]: say, and, um, you know, the connection had
been made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, that's how that got
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, at the time I was like,
I was on probation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at like serious fucking,
you know, uh, you know, law enforcement
[SPEAKER_03]: issues that I had had from the bus that I
just had when all this started happening
[SPEAKER_03]: in 2014, 15 ish, 15, 16 ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but now I look back and I'm like,
I'm really, you know, the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: it does what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try not to get in the way, you know,
when that's, that's where we're at,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so she's an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in light of all that, and then looking
back and seeing like what's available
[SPEAKER_03]: today and what people are in love with
today, I'm really glad it happened because
[SPEAKER_03]: it'd be shitty if it wasn't part of that
conversation or equations, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what, what cannabis is today right now,
you know, so I'm glad it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've chatted a lot about some of the
things in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd love to chat a bit about the
future, you know, at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, you guys revealed there's an
exciting collab in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can people find the clones and what
can they expect going forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, me and Gab, we've been talking and,
um, you know, it was 30 years ago when we,
[SPEAKER_03]: when we kind of had that fateful day and
that, you know, it's like where he's at
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, where I'm at right now,
it just made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we decided after talking
and back and forth and going back and
[SPEAKER_03]: forth, I mean, when me and Gab talk,
it's usually just laughing about stories
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But every now and again, these things come
up and, you know, Gab's got a good,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, extensive lab library.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I mentioned, my partner,
you know, she has a way to sell clones
[SPEAKER_03]: through her website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we here at Lucky Dog Cannabis and
Lucky Dog Seaco are going to start selling
[SPEAKER_03]: our own clones, you know, we're going to
start, uh, selecting other breeder stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so we started talking about all
this and I don't really think it was
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone had the push.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just kind of one of them ideas was
just sitting there for the taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided to just team up and we're
going to do some breeding collaborations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do this clone
collaboration, um, and kind of just work
[SPEAKER_03]: together and share all of our fucking
amazing genetics with anyone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in this stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I'm fucking beside myself excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a dream come true for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just, you know, Gabby means the
world to me has had a huge impact on my
[SPEAKER_03]: life and how my life has turned out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just turned 50 years old and I'm,
you know, I'm able to, I just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we just had dinner together a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to pass through town, unfortunately
it was for a memorial, but I was able to
[SPEAKER_03]: hang, hang with my friend Gabby and eat a
meal for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And God knows how long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, this is what's so
precious about life.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what the good stuff is,
you know, and dinner's amazing and hanging
[SPEAKER_03]: out and conversation, but be able to work
and kind of collaborate with, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: only, you know, Gabby's one of my mentors,
you know, like he's someone who means so
[SPEAKER_03]: much to me, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're only a few years apart,
but you know, when you're 17, 20,
[SPEAKER_03]: 19, 20, 21, like those three or four
years, that's, that's all there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the guy's giving me so much
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course he shared the genetics with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always will have the respect that he was
brave enough to drive that shit across
[SPEAKER_03]: country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people who, you know, they pat
themselves on the back all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have the balls to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have respect for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love my friend Gabby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect my friend Gabby and to be able
to work with him in any capacity is like a
[SPEAKER_03]: dream for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like full circle,
I guess they call it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, you can go to,
you know, as of tonight, you can go
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not when you hear those people,
but tonight is as in Friday, May 12th,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to be able to go to breeders
direct seedco.co.com and Gabby's library
[SPEAKER_03]: will be available there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be collaborating on all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so we have like,
we don't know what to call it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know if we should name it,
but, you know, it's a collaboration
[SPEAKER_03]: between two old friends who give a fuck
about weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the whole world who gives a
shit about weed is going to fucking love
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my take on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appreciate what you said,
Jason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll add to that by saying,
so these other guys from this other
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast, they reached out to me saying
that people wanted to hear what I had to
[SPEAKER_02]: say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was confused because I,
you know, like, I felt like I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: really done anything with the chem dog or
with the skunk in a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, that's what Jason has
been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I've been doing other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I do, you know, Jason is going
to get me the chem dog back and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do some breeding together with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, for a while, I kind of just
wasn't doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had other projects going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people, when, you know,
it was mentioned to me that people really
[SPEAKER_02]: want to hear what I have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm this like known person on the
internet as Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I, you know, that's myself,
you know, maybe people actually do care
[SPEAKER_02]: about what I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was like surprising, you know,
like, because I haven't been in the public
[SPEAKER_02]: eye the way others have, you know,
I've just been trying to get my work done,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and, but, you know, it also was
presented like I'm a super shy person and
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to like, like people were
scared to ask me, including Jason for some
[SPEAKER_02]: reason didn't want to ask me if I wanted
to do a podcast like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, bro, I'm, I'm not that
private, particularly about like shit that
[SPEAKER_02]: we did, you know, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really worried about like that
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to me right now, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that discussion led into like,
Hey, you know, maybe people would be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in a collaboration between,
you know, Stunk VA and Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, we have been working
together for 30 years, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing breathing and other projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you know, took a little time
off, but now our, our friendship is
[SPEAKER_02]: rejuvenated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like I said, Jason was the
first person I ever went into business
[SPEAKER_02]: with, you know, he's the first person I
ever worked with that way, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it seems like the perfect thing for us
30 years later to get back into it and do
[SPEAKER_02]: another project together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, when Jason mentioned to me
that he wanted to do this, I was honored
[SPEAKER_02]: because I consider him the big dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I consider him, he's the one
that's doing all this great work with the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog for years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that he wanted to collaborate
with me, it was an honor for me as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you feeling, are you feeling the love
partner?
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been feeling a little, I'm so happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is, I mean, I've lost so many
fucking people that I won't be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: reconnect with in this life, to be able to
reconnect with you and to be able to have
[SPEAKER_03]: what we have just very fucking moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you can't put a price on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, you can't put anything on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is life.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've, I've lost all the people
that are listening and saying right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are listening are saying you
guys need to get a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't need a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they need to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would be thinking if I'm
hearing this conversation about anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way, that's the way I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm Latin, so I'm not scared to
express, express love to my fellow man,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me neither.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, like that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're lucky to have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so precious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, people say it and they talk
about it, but they almost sound cliche.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is any seconds you last,
you know, to have people you love and the
[SPEAKER_03]: ones that mean the most to you in your
life on a, on a, you know, any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like, like present basis, you know,
daily or whatever basis, it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a gift, you know, and that's how I
feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when, when we talked about
me and you for 30 years and friendship,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what brings it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminded me is like all the shit that
I've been through in my life and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking shit you've been through the good
and the fucking bad that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's why we can be who we are right in
this moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've talked about this, you know,
like, you know, life will come and kick
[SPEAKER_03]: you in the nuts, you know, and remind you
that, you know, who you really are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's done it for myself and I
know it's done it for you because we've
[SPEAKER_03]: talked about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, this is the gravy part to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't scared of hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither are you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the gravy, you know, this is the,
this is the time where we get to enjoy it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and like really be able to put
it all in a frame and see it and just be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, fuck yeah, you know, and that's what
this collaboration is going to be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's going to be that it's going
to be a way to celebrate all this crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm corny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking corny, but that's who I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm corny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big ass corny motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Jason and I get along so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not either.
It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what a, what a beautiful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to just quickly mention,
you know, shout out to the Breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: Syndicate podcast for getting you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know both Jason and I have listened to
the episode and enjoyed it a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not trying to avoid saying the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to give kudos to Notso and
Matt for helping make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise we probably wouldn't be chatting
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to quickly follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people have heard they can get
Gabby's clone library in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is on the Breeders Syndicate,
you mentioned you were smoking on the
[SPEAKER_00]: orangutan titties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all collectively got a laugh
when we heard that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other clones are you vibing on at the
moment, Gabby?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the things from your
collection that you'd be excited for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to try?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the three strains that I'm most excited
about currently are the orangutan titties,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is grease monkey time Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely Skittles dominant and
Skittles is making a big comeback out here
[SPEAKER_02]: in California at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really beautiful weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually won the Emerald Cup last year
for the personal use category.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the personal use category for those
that don't know, it's the most respected
[SPEAKER_02]: category because it includes everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Emerald Cup, they break everything
down by turf profile, whether it's indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse, outdoor, they break it down to
a whole bunch of categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where all the license stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have the personal use
category, which is just like anything
[SPEAKER_02]: goes, anyone can enter and the license
facilities enter as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my buddy Parker Moselle, Phoenix
Haunted it and entered it into the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup and was the winner with that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely rare and it's super nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of them that I'm really
excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other ones are the slaps, which is
grease monkey times runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just received some flower from a
cultivator that's just finishing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really beautiful weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the it's it, the it's it is
rainbow chip times gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out here in California, everybody's
asking for candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I think the it's it is,
is gas candy because it leaves with the
[SPEAKER_02]: gas, but there is a little bit of candy
there and it has color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, those are the strains that
I'm currently most excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to release to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to add, since you, you thanked
Matt and the Breeders Syndicate,
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to mention them and I'm,
you know, I'm glad it's not an issue
[SPEAKER_02]: because if it wasn't for them,
we would not be having this conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, that's what convinced
Jason that I'm not a hermit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: scared to like talk to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if I hadn't done that
podcast, you know, because Jason was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, you know, like we should we should
do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah, we should do something
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the fuck not?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was literally there when it began.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my closest and, you know,
I've known him longer than I've known
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so when I moved to California,
I was scared to talk to people like who
[SPEAKER_02]: lived near me about my growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that's why, you know,
I lived in Noma County.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would drive down Golden Gate Park to try
to find people because I was scared that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, local people would know that I
grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, meeting Jason, when I first
moved to California, pretty much,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe a year or two later,
it was a it was a critical part of my life
[SPEAKER_02]: that I want to keep fresh in my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why I like Jason to tell
these stories to remind me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same here, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely, obviously, huge junction of my
life, you know, meeting you in that park
[SPEAKER_03]: that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that plant, too, don't forget
about her and the other ones we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: involved with, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's it's worth noting for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we didn't care about it too much
until lately, but straight up,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's worth noting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you helping us with this
podcast, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, the pleasure is all mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, one more little stupid story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get before you do, let me just say
one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope this is just part one.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I hope I hope we can do this a bunch
more because.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot more for us to
tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, Gabby, you and I talked
about it like, you know, people may or may
[SPEAKER_03]: we think may find it entertaining just to
hear our fucking conversations we have
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of the situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this, you know, an arena like this
where we just talk about life,
[SPEAKER_03]: read stories and everything else involved,
you know, like, yeah, this is definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: not the end of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that, you know, that's what
I was going to say is like I told and his
[SPEAKER_03]: audience just December.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he asked me, do you think we'll ever
get a chance to talk to Staten Island?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I only call you Staten
Island because that's what they call you
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Internet, just so you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I'm not going to name
drop you if if everyone else is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then and then I told him, I said,
hey, no, he's very private.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other day, I told you that
story and you made the fucking you made
[SPEAKER_03]: the funniest point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, my name is Gabby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not private.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing private about me
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so, you know, I don't know
where I get that idea from.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, what you said makes more sense
to me than what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have a commercial on the radio
in Mendocino County and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for my grow shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it used to go, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Gabby from the Garden Spell,
Mendocino's premier indoor garden shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I put myself out there so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm the least private person
in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't I don't know many people
that put them at least that early.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and to be to hear that,
like I'm this private guy, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, news to me, you know, like,
you know, and I was really so just blown
[SPEAKER_02]: away that people wanted to hear what I had
to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, people wanted to hear what I had to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like when when Matt from the
syndicate called me up and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people really want to hear what
you have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does anyone want to hear what I have
to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just and so it's a good
feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people have said a lot of nice
things about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been very little shade thrown in
my direction, actually zero shade thrown
[SPEAKER_02]: in my direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you know, the most
respected growers out there like Jason are
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that I grew the best weed he ever
saw in his life at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's all super nice shit,
you know, and I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, and I think on when you say,
you know, you're surprised people are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, honestly, it just speaks to one
of the points Jason made on one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: early episodes I did with him,
which is that, you know, fact is more
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting than fiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, you know, a lot of
people have these weird stories about chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the real one is actually by
far the most interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always funny because Matt,
Matt, from the syndicate, he had said to
[SPEAKER_02]: me, he said, well, people find so
endearing about you was that you didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: flex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said to him, I don't know what I
have to flex about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, you know, and actually I
corrected him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know, there are things
that I will flex about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really proud of how many people I
taught to grow and inspired to grow and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, help take their grows to the
next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I had the first indoor
garden shop in Mendocino County and I put
[SPEAKER_02]: grow lights on on Highway 101.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you were driving, you know,
from Mendocino County North, you saw you
[SPEAKER_02]: saw my grow lights in the window,
you know, and, you know, so like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that's that's my flex.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like what I did for the chem
dog, like maybe I didn't see enough value
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I needed other people to,
like, tell me how important it was for
[SPEAKER_02]: them to for me to put more value.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I I always felt like if I did a big
flex about the chem dog, that I'd look
[SPEAKER_02]: like an asshole because really all I was
was the delivery driver and somebody that
[SPEAKER_02]: grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like Greg was the one that,
you know, grew the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, V.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason here, he's the one that made all
these subsequent crosses afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what's my legacy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I'm the bus driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the delivery driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just didn't see what my flex was,
you know, and I appreciate being told that
[SPEAKER_02]: it was more important than I I give my,
you know, give myself credit for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not going to flex, you know,
I'm still not going to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know when I will after me and Jason
put out some legendary shit that changes
[SPEAKER_02]: things and changes the way people think
about cannabis, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe I'll flex.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Gab, the thing is about flexing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really understand exactly what
that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what I think is that
just coming out here and like talking to
[SPEAKER_03]: people and saying stories, showing your
point of view, that's all the flex is
[SPEAKER_03]: needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's it's it's to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just our life and goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to people who, you know, you know,
who are paying attention, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: and care, it's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's legendary shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: People fucking appreciate you,
Sharon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I definitely I definitely appreciate
the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has made me blush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, has given me an opportunity to
tell some good friends that I really care
[SPEAKER_02]: about them having the opportunity to tell
these stories and more listen to these
[SPEAKER_02]: stories with my friends like Jason and not
so dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brought me so much pleasure the last
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like all these people messaging
me saying how much they enjoyed the
[SPEAKER_02]: stories and how much they appreciate me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And literally so far, I've gotten zero
shade, zero hate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm I'm super grateful for you guys
and for Matt and for not so dog for giving
[SPEAKER_02]: me this opportunity to feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to return the favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before we wrap things up,
I want to ask you guys a few quick fire
[SPEAKER_00]: questions as we normally do before we end
the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one's for you, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the most memorable terpene profile
in your mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second one is the the holy
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Big Sur holy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can still smell that weed and taste it
in the back of my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't had it since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of smells does it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it hard to describe?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the skunk was truly skunky and the
haze is like what the original type of
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think of haze, I always think of
that Big Sur holy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's everything else that I would be
comparing it to that, because that was my
[SPEAKER_02]: first experience of haze weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jason, yourself, most memorable
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, super skunk for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel it in my nasals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel it in my sinus, you know,
that coating it does in your sinus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that earthy, sharp skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would like to go back a little
long further to the Beatrix Choice,
[SPEAKER_03]: that deep grape bubble gum flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's starting to fade now,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the super skunk is still in my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the way it would break up into
that cotton is really soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much like the sourdise, when you twist it
up, it's like it's not like hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of smooshy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fatty, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like that cotton.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I had to add a third one,
it would be the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, but I mean, I was already
stretching it when I did two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I felt like yes, for one,
and I gave you two.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tough question, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Big Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was just, I remember,
like, I had gotten a batch of it sent to
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City when I was living in New
York and growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was outdoor weed, full term
outdoor weed, not greenhouse grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, I think, like,
man, that weed stood up to anything today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so that's a herb I'd like to
connect with again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the last question, before we
wrap up, if you could only have one strain
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke for the rest of your life,
we'll go to SkunkVA first this time and
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby second.
[SPEAKER_00]: One strain for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I answer first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I answer first?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you just ask that question?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same answer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the same fucking question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, though, I think the Kim dog,
because the effect of the Kim dog just
[SPEAKER_03]: shoots me much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is the same question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabby's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say the Kim dog because it
works all day long, every day,
[SPEAKER_03]: all night long, all night.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't even like getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I just smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me, it's strictly about the
turf profile of the Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my buddy and I, my buddy and I,
he lives in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always do it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We say whoever comes up with the fucking
the strain with fucking seven percent
[SPEAKER_03]: turps, it has that drippy gas flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the person who wins the game right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree because, you know, you can only
smoke as much as your fucking head can
[SPEAKER_03]: take, you know, with your mouth,
your that flavor, that mouth coat,
[SPEAKER_03]: that in the back of your throat,
on the back of your teeth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want more and more and more of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're when we were young and
Gabby gave me the Kim dog, he's like two
[SPEAKER_03]: rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, you're not going to like don't
get the same one, but you're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: really want to grow this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't root well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, don't smoke it in a bubbler
before 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was funny at the time, because all
we did was smoke fatties all fucking day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was then I could smoke Kim dog
fatties all day when I was 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays, I'm like, I started to like
drool and stare at the wall, but I still
[SPEAKER_03]: want to take it on the hicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'm not going to like tout
less THC and more flavor, but kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you answer the same question for
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: To get you involved, to get you more
involved in this podcast, you've barely
[SPEAKER_02]: been involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was enjoying being a fly on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you take a nap?
[SPEAKER_00]: For periods, for periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think that I would struggle to
match you two guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I pick the Kim dog,
that would be like a non-functional for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would need something a bit more sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bit of a sativa guy, maybe like a
nice super silver haze hybrid or like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chaska super silver haze cross Kim
dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever done that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I've smoked it at your house and
it was brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't make your forehead sweat,
but almost the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with that being said, does either of
you have any general comments or shout
[SPEAKER_00]: outs before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you already did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little shout out to the Breeders
Syndicate because they were they were
[SPEAKER_02]: really responsible for us thinking about
doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'll thank both of you guys
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll thank the people that are interested
in hearing stories from Satin Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever gave me that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess I'm going to keep it now
because nobody knows who Gabby is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Satin Island is this famous character.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows who Gabby is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my new ad to be like, Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Gabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an island coming to you from Lucky
Dog Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope we get to talk much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that just about brings us to
the end of it.
