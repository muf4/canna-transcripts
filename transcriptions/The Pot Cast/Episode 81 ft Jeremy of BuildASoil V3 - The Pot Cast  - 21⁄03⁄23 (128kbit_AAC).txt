organics and how to get the most out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil and your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know him, you love him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further delay, let's get into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, gang, we're back for another
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this one, we are grateful to be
joined by the organic wizard behind
[SPEAKER_00]: Builder Soil, a man you all know and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy, big thank you for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for having me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great to talk to you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you must be up there with some of
the most appearances we've had so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I feel honored to be on that short
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess to get things started today,
tell me, what have you been smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, recently I'm usually doing something
fresh and I've really been enjoying some
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor that I just threw a few earth box
boxes out really late season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is there's no effort
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you do a full season
outdoors, especially out here,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain times the sun's intense in the
beginning and then the wind gets bad later
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have the trellis, which you should
anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just threw some earth boxes out
really late and they just stacked in a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice little bushes that I had to do
nothing to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran some moms and this is right
about the time my wife ended up going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hip surgery, elective one for some hip
issues she was born with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to leave town for about a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of why I chose this
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person watching my house could just
water the earth box.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I pulled down three really great
planets and I've been smoking on those as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as some of the last harvest here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those three are the halitosis by
covert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a chem D, you know,
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a marshmallow OG, which had had
that cut for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one was really had a lot of fuel
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say a little tiny hint of mental
mental in there somewhere where the
[SPEAKER_01]: halitosis is just straight fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also grew some chem 91 that I
got by cutting the a local that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been friends with a lot of the
breeders for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think out of Tom Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just really wanted to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up liking the halitosis a little
bit more, but I could see why the chem 91
[SPEAKER_01]: it had that same flavor profile and odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've been smoking on
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anyone who's been keeping up with your
YouTube series, they would probably have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen that those sort of chem D halitosis
sort of plants have popped up a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that sort of the terpene
profile you gravitate towards,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's just one that's been around?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do like that fuel that it really
imparts like that mouth coat, that fuel
[SPEAKER_01]: feel and taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like along with that,
you get a lot of potency in those
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just seems to work really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greasy, just a lot of the things that
I look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have been smoking on some of these
strawberry milk and cookies from dad's
[SPEAKER_01]: night out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an auto flower and kind of
surprised that I'd be actually grabbing
[SPEAKER_01]: that jar still.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's pretty potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got great bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of mix it up because that
one's got some fuel to it, but it's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of fruitiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being able to alternate,
you know, flavors is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen Daz put out a lot of work
over the past year, really solidifying his
[SPEAKER_00]: name in the auto community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've been working with them
on your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you changed your point of view,
like in terms of like, do you think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get to a point pretty soon where
autos are like sort of indistinguishable
[SPEAKER_00]: in the quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's tough to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're pretty indistinguishable
from what I can determine, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: feel every breeders probably in that same
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know because I've not grown a lot
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if everyone was the same results that
I've gotten out of the limited run that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done, it's hard to discern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if someone brought me a bag,
I wouldn't be able to tell that was an
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're just all the frost,
all the flavor and potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm happy with that, but there's
some things that I don't think they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to fully overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that they're overcomeable in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I mean by that is like
commercially, yeah, someone could run a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of auto flower seeds,
but I still think they're going to lack
[SPEAKER_01]: uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as size, there may be some that are
more uniform than others, certain genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're able to do a really good job
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly Daza seeds were a lot more
uniform than I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also learned, which I already knew
and suspected, but I learned more in this
[SPEAKER_01]: last run was that any sort of tampering
with them at all, or transplanting instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of directly sowing, it seems to reduce the
size a lot because it triggers them into
[SPEAKER_01]: their auto flowering nature much faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing that I just
really don't like, which isn't going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: solved, is the fact that if you do find
something that you're really attracted to
[SPEAKER_01]: and you would like to keep it,
you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, it doesn't kill it for
me because I feel like auto flowers fill a
[SPEAKER_01]: niche that's very, very needed and
everyone might use in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tool for a certain job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows me to have great difference
in flavor, variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I know that they're potent
and taste good, I'm happy to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at home, I have a bedroom that I could
just throw one in if I have some space and
[SPEAKER_01]: get some extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a million reasons why I would
consider using them for people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: brand new, or someone that just really not
that into growing, but wants to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great way to introduce them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of benefits there, but man,
almost kills it for me to know that no
[SPEAKER_01]: matter how great the plant is that I might
select, I can't keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it almost has me not even looking,
I just go, well, whatever happens happens,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not trying to discern which one's
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to be a one-off
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost got some interesting
spiritual, metaphysical sort of underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this hunt, so to speak,
that's almost pointless, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm looking for something I want to
keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take that, now I'm not
pursuing it the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it's totally fine, it scratches
a different itch, I guess I'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the equivalent of being in the
moment as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's some of that needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have more seeds than time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you take apart the
responsibility of selecting the winner out
[SPEAKER_01]: of these supposed trophies in your seed
vault, it's pretty easy just to pop seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's like, well, I'm not going to
keep them anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say it goes both ways for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I would be remiss with myself if I
didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shameless self-promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've grown out an extremely
reputable breeder, Heavy Days Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Licorice Mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your experiences with that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recall back specifically, I can almost
picture the plant in my mind because of
[SPEAKER_01]: how colourful and resin-railed it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember enjoying it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while, so I can't remember
with detail what the flavour profile and
[SPEAKER_01]: notes were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember going, oh, shit,
I better grow this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still have a pack from you that I'd
love to pop at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might have to get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think, God, the Phantom
Cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I run?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has Raspberry Mama in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Phantom Crackers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Phantom Crackers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to send you some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting connection from across
the world, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's part of why I really
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked you grew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed recently on the YouTube
series, you were running a bunch of Duke's
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the Beefcake D,
was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran the Beefcake D and I have other
packs from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those I purchased serendipitously
before we decided to work together a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been really slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: To come to fruition, but we did discuss
doing a sort of soil recipe for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of just releasing it,
we decided to make it, send it to him,
[SPEAKER_01]: have him do a full run in it and give us
some feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last I heard, he was pulling
everything down and was really excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very happy with the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully that would lead to a
release of a Duke Diamond soil recipe this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was stoked that I bought those
Beefcake D before that conversation ever
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like, it wasn't motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before he got locked up for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that happened, he was at an
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kevin from Ruwise was talking to him a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had mentioned, you know,
wanting to try some build a soil stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to buy some packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that conversation kind of started.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't until he reached out to me,
you know, a year or more later that we
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up bringing it to full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed those Beefcake D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have more packs of his that I really
like pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, more seeds than time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you gave me the perfect segue in that
one of our Patreon listeners wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they've seen you work with a few
different notable guys, like obviously you
[SPEAKER_00]: just mentioned Duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on the website, I even saw
that you guys have done up a kit for a gas
[SPEAKER_00]: of Swami Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the Patreon supporters
question is sort of, are there any major
[SPEAKER_00]: variances in these mix in terms of like,
would you recommend one for a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's more about just like
they're comparable, but you just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: pick which one appeals a little more to
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel like the more I learn,
the less I think that there's very,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, specific differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is good in,
good out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like comparing two healthy
people's diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if the results are good from
both people, then you'd be probably safe
[SPEAKER_01]: to copy either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there may be some nuances that
operationally are slightly different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Gascanistan was part of the original
LoS forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was he and, you know, MGD and I,
and some others, we worked heavily behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the scenes to just discuss all of these
topics at hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were so friendly and answering so
many questions and also had like a vibe
[SPEAKER_01]: that was trying to get all the people that
were going this direction, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the Coop was there and we ended up
after all of the drama on the forums,
[SPEAKER_01]: which always follows each other around,
especially in the organic forum,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was like arguing with hydro people
and then like retreating back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic section.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was private threads behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ended up as things got broken
out and people were banned and all those,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, typical political things
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up creating a forum together,
which was that living organic soil forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I helped do all the technical stuff
and set up the VB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bulletin, you know, the back end and just,
I had time at that point and I was very
[SPEAKER_01]: transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told them, look, and I'm starting this
company called Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm going to work with you on this
LoS forum, it's going to be towards that
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never tried to be marketing about
it, but I was helping that because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also knowing that my time was probably
going to be consumed by business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure how long into it,
maybe a year, year and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was consuming more time than I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build A Soil was taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just said, listen, I would prefer
that you guys take this over fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate everything you've done
this far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then years later, they reached back
out and said, Hey, would you mind making
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a recipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have all these ingredients
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would help us with some of our,
you know, friends and customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we created that recipe and that was
really, it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, we've been able to
work with some great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know many breeders have reached out,
sent us seeds or we've shared Build A Soil
[SPEAKER_01]: products behind the scenes, just kind of
in a, in like a friendly manner where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no money exchange, just hanging
out, sharing ideas with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the really,
really big benefits that I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that I've come to enjoy when I
started Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an organic story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that you had that long
history in the back with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only reason why everything's
not more vocalized is there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: politics, you know, and not everybody got
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Blue J Way had a falling out with
Gastanistan and ended up become Mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when that fell apart,
then Coot tried to work with Mountain and
[SPEAKER_01]: that fell apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Coot has some definite feelings about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I happen to know that Coot is an old
Coot and has some feelings about a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I try not to take on other people's
stories, but I think that if we're all in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same room, not everybody would be
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Build A Soil, one of the things that
I've prided myself on is I really try and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep genuine relationships and I try not
to judge people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try and just, you know, keep that
integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's been pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's allowed me to work with all
sides of, like I've worked with Mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics before, didn't quite work out his
soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't exactly the same as what we
typically make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that logistics and million
other reasons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in California, I'm in Colorado,
worked with Gastanistan on that small
[SPEAKER_01]: project and that, you know, mainly moves
to his customer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like the ingredients in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our stuff with Coot has been
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with Jay Plantspeaker and then
now potentially Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just hope it continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got sort of related to this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an interesting comment from one of
our Patreon listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of said something to the effect
of like, oh, amendments are like strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in and out of fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know, are there any amendments
that you think are coming back into
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, that's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amendments are totally like fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that the human diet is
similar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like certain salads or certain soups or
certain styles of food will become very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very popular for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, right,
we all just need to be able to put some
[SPEAKER_01]: fuel in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully if you're like me,
it's organic and clean and you have these
[SPEAKER_01]: preferences for health, but it's similar
comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as far as fad that I've seen come
and go, although I love neem cake,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's definitely been some resistance
for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: People equating it to some of the watered
down neem product products on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also because of cannabis, hypermesis,
I think was unfairly blamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's been some weird politics
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp meal has always been very popular,
but recently with heavy metal testing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States and specific States
being very, very proactive about it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where politically it almost seems
like they were trying to force people to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow hydroponically by reducing the level
of metals allowed to ridiculous levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also for instance, like cadmium,
when we first learned about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, arsenic, we found out that
there was organic arsenic versus inorganic
[SPEAKER_01]: arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we reach out to the kelp supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very aware of that when it comes
to animal feed, but I think Michigan even
[SPEAKER_01]: lists which one they prefer, but they only
test for the total.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think kelp meal has kind of
gotten taken out a little bit because it
[SPEAKER_01]: does have some natural arsenic that,
I mean, shoot, some of the longest living
[SPEAKER_01]: populations eat seaweed all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's not a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the home grower, it's not a
concern, but I think those politics
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulate some of the fad swings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think kelp meal will probably come
back with a vengeance as people start to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn and understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I would say fad wise right now,
I don't know if there's anything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming and going, anything in particular,
but those are two that really stand out to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, there's nothing that I'm
thinking, oh, this is going to be a big
[SPEAKER_01]: fad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to jump into the name a little
more, but I always like to give this
[SPEAKER_00]: caveat because I agree, I'm not sold at
all that neem oil specifically is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for our cannabis hyperemesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a paper out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a case study of a guy who rocked up
to a hospital and he had accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: drunk 30 mil of neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he said it was in a cup and he
thought it was something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he got very, very sick and had
cyclic vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was another case of someone
who ingested about 10 mil and they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get as sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it basically suggested was
that if neem was the responsible agent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would probably need to consume a lot
more than what could be residually on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was the story I always got
told.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, this is from people
spraying neem or using neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the evidence really supports
it that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to delve more into the neem thing,
one of our listeners did want to ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to ask Jeremy, if we could hear
more about his thoughts on neem
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically around like any controversies
or misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it seems like some people are
reluctant to use it while others swear by
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it very often, but I know how
well it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of the reason I don't use
it is, you know, it's oily and it has an
[SPEAKER_01]: odor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so depending on the use case,
I think prevention is really ideal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but neem oil works so well in certain
instances and you know, when we started
[SPEAKER_01]: sourcing neem oil, we found there was a
wildly different amount of these liminoids
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Azadirachtin A and B and Membin and
Salonin and all these others that I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned about from Coot and from the neem
textbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of what Coot always taught me and
relied upon was that these were thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of years old as far as being utilized as
medicinal plants with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so obviously anything medicinal,
you can abuse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe neem oil, neem bark,
neem leaf, all these things have been
[SPEAKER_01]: ingested for a long time in amounts that
would be fairly normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody wants to go just
drink olive oil, but obviously neem has
[SPEAKER_01]: some definite, some things to these
liminoids that are of benefit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but could also be of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I believe the issue comes from is
when I'm purchasing neem oil, the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: it works out there is that it's all wild
harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not having like a 40 acre neem tree
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may exist now, but for the most part,
the vast majority of all neem was wild
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested and the villagers or anybody
that would be collecting these seeds could
[SPEAKER_01]: then exchange them for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so during the season, everybody
collect the best ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring them to the facility and they
would pay you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be a little more complex than
that, but that's how I understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would mix all that together
and some trees grown in certain areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: a mature tree and a certain type of soil
or climate may have a much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: Azadirachtin, Membin, Salonin content than
other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so typically what you get left with is
the average, whatever's in the oil that
[SPEAKER_01]: they produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the way, you know,
these things work and people are selling
[SPEAKER_01]: it for Azadirachtin purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these manufacturers would
formulate neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wouldn't just press it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would then take extract of
Azadirachtin and others, and they would
[SPEAKER_01]: mix it in there so that you would have at
least some minimum quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes I found that these
formulations were lower than even the
[SPEAKER_01]: quantities we were finding of the premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we were able to get the best,
it was just wild harvested and it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had very high amounts of these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my suspicion is that some of these
extracts that are being used when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: being formulated back into the oil,
you wouldn't know when you're buying the
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there'd be a vast difference
between a formulated version versus an all
[SPEAKER_01]: natural version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to take it a step further,
many of the people that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar spraying, at least the majority are
not using a natural, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: neem oil, typically when you hear neem and
it comes to a commercial row, it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a product that's pre emulsified and
is an extract of neem and then is highly
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of it is just understanding
that and knowing that many of these
[SPEAKER_01]: potential health effects could be from the
fact that they're using neem products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are different than a naturally occurring
neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take that a step further and
you find out that a number of these
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers that were manufacturing a
neem extract product and as a product as
[SPEAKER_01]: they call it, were pulled off the shelves
for adding in a number of other pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: that were not listed on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you understand the cannabis
industry and how products are sold and how
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been so many suppliers taken out,
it models up the argument a lot going,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, do you even know if this was a
contaminated multiple pesticide as a
[SPEAKER_01]: product that was being used or whether it
was just something normal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to say because, you know,
there's going to be some growers that
[SPEAKER_01]: said, Hey, I used to grow with neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I don't, I don't have cannabis
hypermesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that that's the least argument
that I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly it's like a friend I know or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been tons of research on both
sides, at least by wannabe sleuths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an exact answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My gut tells me that it's not this neem
oil and that when you use a natural neem
[SPEAKER_01]: oil, you emulsify it properly that it's
going to work really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the challenge I think with
organics is that none of them eradicate
[SPEAKER_01]: everything completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes some discipline, some repeat
application and you know, really
[SPEAKER_01]: preemptive getting it early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like a lot of people are
probably using it incorrectly saying it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then following up with, yeah,
there's also these health concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I don't have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, if I was tasked with doing,
I mean, a lot of fruit tree growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many people that use neem oil
and have really good results with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't hesitate to use it on my
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do know that you can test for
azadirachtin and you'll show a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're using it heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would avoid using it in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use it in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, some great thoughts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had heard people say something like,
it can actually damage the microbial life
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard anything along those
lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've argued against that pretty
significantly because it was, I think ill
[SPEAKER_01]: founded.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at naturally occurring
amounts in the neem cake and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody's dumping oil in their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're there, there shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the neem cake is typically what that
argument was against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Coot shared all the information
because, you know, he obviously cared
[SPEAKER_01]: because he had shared people the benefits
of neem early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was a number of studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think specifically people were
saying that it kills the fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungi, and that it would be a problem
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a number of studies where you
can see people adding neem cake as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: other medicinal herbs to the
pre-sterilized mushroom growing bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then fruiting fungi on it and getting
phenomenal yielding results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nature's complicated in that way where
it may have some adverse effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's through a pathway that has an
ability to discern what its targets are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is people are
amazed to find that neem oil is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: harmless when it comes to beneficials and
soil life, but pretty harmful when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to some of these pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, well, that doesn't make
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how is that possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can it choose?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, the bug that's
eating your plant ends up eating the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: where the other ones that don't eat your
plant aren't eating the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as you take it a step deeper,
you tend to see like, oh, that's why it
[SPEAKER_01]: works on this, but not the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as biology and fungi, I'd imagine
anything you overdo could cause a problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've seen you just sprinkle neem cake
on the soil to proliferate for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will say that honey is totally
antibacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so someone might suppose that adding
honey would just kill all the bacteria in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil until you realize that putting a
drop of water in the honey will spoil the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole batch pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when it's intact, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you dilute it, now it's lost
its antimicrobial properties and it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes part of nature and part of life in
which decay is absolutely a big part of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you your thoughts on a
sort of related topic, which is like over
[SPEAKER_00]: the few years, and I suspect it's in part
due to the proliferation of the Elaine
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingham classes she teaches, but I've seen
a lot more people trying to assess the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of say their compost or their
medium through the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, do you think a view under
the microscope gives you a full picture or
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think that like it's not
necessarily going to tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, if it looks good under the
microscope, it might not necessarily be
[SPEAKER_00]: good or do you think there's a pretty
strong correlation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's a very strong
correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be overstepping here, but I'd
rather talk about what my gut and my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience really shares and I do not
incorporate a microscope into my gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: methods and I don't think others should
feel like they have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have one, I certainly think that
you're going to find correlation to seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: biological life in healthy conditions,
but I'm hesitant to say that you can take
[SPEAKER_01]: a microscope, certainly an average
microscope at that, and identify if
[SPEAKER_01]: something is a specific name of bacteria
and be part positive that that specific
[SPEAKER_01]: slide that you're viewing would indicate
that it's a quality compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that biology can exist on a low
quality compost as far as how it's ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: to integrating into a soil mix or how it's
ideal into using on your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the way nature works is typically
what makes a good compost would also lead
[SPEAKER_01]: to great biological life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of what confuses me
sometimes when people would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, if you have a sulfate in your soil,
it's going to kill the microbiology,
[SPEAKER_01]: like using some sort of trace mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've since learned that that's really
not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, in nature, there's going to
be some of these trace elements and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an abundance of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's about that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen a lot of compost that
visually, even without a microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: are teeming with life and they are just
awful for producing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where that comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is the percentage
of sodium, the percentage of potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: that both of those the percentage of
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you have high magnesium,
high potassium, high sodium, and plants
[SPEAKER_01]: will still use it in very low dilution,
but you add it at 30 percent in your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe, you could just ruin your entire
soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: But visually, you could see fungi growing
on it and you could put it under a scope
[SPEAKER_01]: and see biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have to be anaerobic to
have a nutrient profile that wouldn't lend
[SPEAKER_01]: itself to the same percentages we use in
our compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're using when you're not
building a soil, you're just brewing a
[SPEAKER_01]: tea, the argument becomes doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trying to brew the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Coot really taught me early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, behind the scenes, he was
basically saying compost is your complete
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And didn't really like the whole keep it
simple tea brewer thing that was going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though he really respected Elon
Hussey and Tad was on the forums at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it all civil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbureganics was there and he worked
with Keep It Simple via I think Elon is
[SPEAKER_01]: his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I could be getting some of this
wrong, but he's credited basically with
[SPEAKER_01]: inventing compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, Coot's not going to go
on there and be like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea is stupid because microbe
organics and you had Tad and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tad never grew plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I always focused on Tad Wilson
because he was a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Tad Wilson, Tim Wilson and Tim
and I still exchange emails every once in
[SPEAKER_01]: a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really have I really like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a special like I just warm,
warm feelings come up when I think about
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always been very helpful behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very polite and discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe a lot of what he said as far
as what compost tea can do and what they
[SPEAKER_01]: can produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But behind the scenes, too, people are
like, man, two point three, eight percent
[SPEAKER_01]: vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come on, you know, what are these
numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had a scientific mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when he found a number that worked
for him, he's going to list very
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Coot was like, man, just put the
castings on the soil, just top dress the
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why are you trying to put it in
water and move it around?
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all just from the bread baking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you know, I mean, yeah,
maybe you do an auto lies like maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll mix the yeast and water for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, it's going to
proliferate like it's just going to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow and grow and grow and grow in its
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't do as many compost teas as I
once tinkered with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it all has its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really interesting answer,
because I feel like over the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, two years or so, I've seen more and
more growers who historically were sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself and I, where they're just
sort of not using many teas and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just sort of building the soil and
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a move towards people using more
powdered products in their regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like Organics Alive, some of these
are the Thriven you sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these products are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question becomes, do you think
as we get more of these products and tools
[SPEAKER_00]: in our arsenal, we will begin to utilise
them more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it would like at the core
of it all, a lot of people will just stay
[SPEAKER_00]: with like top dressing, watering only?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's two questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to answer them in a way
that I feel like when I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as not to forget, I'll address them
and then I'll try and answer them so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can help remind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of them is, is there benefits
using all these powdered stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see them as tools to get the job
done easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of, you know, you can't produce
more than 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you take a genetic and it's full
potential, these powders will help you get
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but you're never going to surpass
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can achieve that without using
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say that there's, you know,
it's like sometimes using a staple gun is
[SPEAKER_01]: easier than using a stapler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes using a nail gun is better than
a hammer, but you do need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can use the hammer all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it comes to soil, that's one
of the arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I use some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I don't, depends on the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is the psychology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you, we like,
I know myself, I like to tinker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think you're going to get
everybody to just stop tinkering and just
[SPEAKER_01]: do water only because although it may
work, and work very well, you're left with
[SPEAKER_01]: time and you're left thinking,
well, I wonder, and I want to try this and
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's going to happen,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's at least me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like saying, Hey, can you just eat
the same thing seven days a week in the
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, sure, probably very healthy,
but I'll never do it because I enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: tinkering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different to a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I'm forced to taste it,
but I think that's part of what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is just psychologically we'll always be
wanting to try new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I think in cannabis as well,
it's like, we want to have that fire and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to be able to share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything that might help you get
that more consistently, I think is likely
[SPEAKER_01]: to be moving in and out of these fads and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be people buying
stuff and trying it, but circling back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefit of them, I definitely find
myself where when I'm busy doing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more, just water only, but I do notice
that like amino acids, man, they really
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help things grow faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I noticed a lot of health in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it comes to living soil,
we're not adding a lot of quick release
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, which is good because I don't
really think it's a huge benefit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's typically a lot that can slow
release from the organic matter and the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed meals and the other things,
but tapping in at the speed of the biology
[SPEAKER_01]: under intense grow lights in a perfect
environment, sometimes depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics is less than ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while it can be done, I think the
way to do water only, where you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: least amount of issue is to do the less is
more everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have the highest intensity of
lighting, have a good environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: have things where they're likely to just
produce phenomenal health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start steering them or
driving them slightly harder for
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial purposes or just for fun,
some of these products make a difference
[SPEAKER_01]: in the speed of delivery where you can
outpace that biological, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant can kind of outpace the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when like you've overshot
the container size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of new growers are like,
yeah, five gallons, huge, that's bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: than I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm like, why there's now a foot
of empty space between one container and
[SPEAKER_01]: the next, just fill it all with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you overshoot a five gallon,
some of these water solubles will really
[SPEAKER_01]: help you keep that yield up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're tools, but again, you can get
phenomenal quality water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of the desire to do that
from the purest is that it is achieved the
[SPEAKER_01]: same result, maybe arguably better,
but the same result, okay, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just finesse we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did it in a very pure way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's something to achieving
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you've done it, I also feel like,
well, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this produces good results too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's now more organic powders that
actually are very clean ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it starts to give you some of that
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are my thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many like little gems in there
I'd love to dig into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess, first and foremost,
I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new mantra, floor space is dead space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage people to get a bigger pot
or to chuck another pot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can certainly appreciate the point
about those powdered products can help you
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay on top of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know myself, I am that guy you
referenced running five gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say to people, look, sometimes I
feel like organics is like, it can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit disingenuous, like some of the
marketing in the sense that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some people who say,
yeah, you can do water only in a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to talk about what you say,
which is like, you're probably leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff on the table in the sense that it
might need that bit of extra help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's unlikely they get it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if they have a big stretcher and they
don't flip like day one, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: newer growers are like, well, I've edged
45 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, fine, a five gallon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a caveat when someone says,
this is water only soil, I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I'm going to grow a 10 pounder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it still water only?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so although it's easier for me to say,
yes, water only, that's the white belt
[SPEAKER_01]: answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black belt answer is always,
well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not as marketable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that Judo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to run an idea by you that
I've been trying to emphasize more.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the listeners to our show are
coming more from the passion side.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good number of them that work in
the industry, but a lot of them are like
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing this because they love
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I realized was is a lot of people
in our community, they do really crunch
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers on things and want to pick the
most cost efficient option and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, sort of in line with the
mantra you were talking about with the
[SPEAKER_00]: autos and like not thinking about it and
sort of enjoying yourself a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to approach growing with this
different mindset of like my brother,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a real tech head.
[SPEAKER_00]: He buys the newest PlayStation as soon as
it comes out and he's got the newest
[SPEAKER_00]: gadgets and that's what makes him happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what he spends his money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I should do the same thing
with growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I should stop trying to get the
cheapest thing and approach it as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it's a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw money at it and you know,
and I have a good time with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think since doing that, I sort of
had a bit more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously I'm not spending my
entire savings on growing, but I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get out of the mindset of like
doing this as cheap as possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking this is a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to spend a little bit of money
on your hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on that mindset?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that if someone is trying to
replace a cost in their life, it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: worthwhile to do it in the most cost
effective manner so that you're not lying
[SPEAKER_01]: to yourself about why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually when you become a producer
and you do eliminate that expense and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're happy with it, I feel like it's
only right to invest back into what is
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at some of these tools,
they make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost joke with friends and I'm sure
you have too that these plants are making
[SPEAKER_01]: us do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I want a better light,
go buy it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, who's smarter?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, this one particular plant
is overtaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's grown everywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's given a very happy life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's able to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from a pure survival of the fittest
standpoint, that old thing is are we
[SPEAKER_01]: growing the plants or the plants
cultivating us so that when we all die,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get to eat us, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like it's, I think they'll be here
longer and I'm not scared to invest in it
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've noticed some big differences like
quality of grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I call this dialing it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you first start for me,
I was working at a nine to five and I knew
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'd need a flower tent instead of
just my veg tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was keeping genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to my grow shop and I said,
Hey, if you front me a flower tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pay you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as I get over the next
month, but that would allow me to
[SPEAKER_01]: transition my plants before they were too
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And miss my timeline to wait for budget
and maybe not the best to do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they worked with me and I was able to
step up to the next and have a veg and a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower room and then paid them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I own two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for me, lighting was the same
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get a light that worked for my budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then immediately, as soon as I could
get like the better light, I'd put that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the budget budget one would go
kind of to the veg area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually you're like,
okay, well, it's really dry in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should invest in humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start tinkering with stuff that
basically takes hours and it's never
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: F it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to buy the best humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, Oh my God, the plants
grow so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely worth it to invest some
money, have the fun, see the results,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't want people to hear that
they're on a budget, think they can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that it is more fun to buy the
latest tech and, and throw it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really having fun with the automation
tools, the Neewa that we use, N I W A it's
[SPEAKER_01]: that power strip thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really great how it automates the
humidity and temperature and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things by firing and actually controlling
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're running a professional
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I would also echo your sentiment
that the reason why I get the most fun out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the new gear I buy is because I learned
how to make good results while doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty frugally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can do that, when you get the
new gear, you'll just be crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely get behind you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently we had Jake and Marco of the no
till Kings come on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spoke very highly of you and your
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear like, you know,
what, what's your experience been working
[SPEAKER_00]: with facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing any more facilities get on
board?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like they were one of the first
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a bit of a rundown on
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd say they were one of the first
that, that would endorse us publicly as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as like a lot of people in the
beginning would never tell that they used
[SPEAKER_01]: any brand because they didn't want,
it was always like, well, we got to beat
[SPEAKER_01]: the, we got to have better than the people
down the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that there's been a big shakeup in
the industry, so to speak, I feel like so
[SPEAKER_01]: Kings is always very transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah, we use build this all
3.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they teach their whole process and
they're above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they grind up their own stocks for
mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they're really detail oriented and
I'm super impressed by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been hundreds of facilities that
came before them and hundreds that'll come
[SPEAKER_01]: after, but last year was definitely
declined in commercial orders for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we overcame that with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simultaneously, we're already going to be
going after the wholesale market,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, lawn and garden stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw it as a way to provide an
income stream to these garden and hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: stores that were all at the same catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these were just the race to
the bottom as far as pricing and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro stores closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a big shift, you know,
during Corona people were buying a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more rec and medical herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that they're all back at work,
there's been a lot less sales on the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial side.
[SPEAKER_01]: California had a huge shakeup politically
and the cost per pound and over
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we saw a huge decline in commercial
rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'd send two, three
truckloads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get multiple a hundred yard quotes and
we'd be running them all over the country
[SPEAKER_01]: and not everyone fall through,
but a lot of people would step up and we'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be sending trucks everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year we've been saying like full
truckloads of cubic footers and stuffed
[SPEAKER_01]: along in garden stores and a different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did the same amount of business
last year's sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's two years ago as we did last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so seeing that change I think has me
believe that there's probably less
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial grows as far as the numbers
stepping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like New Mexico in 2022 really
had maybe 2021, a lot of people just
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of the woodworks because some
of the changes in the law and then all of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sudden 2022 overproduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are tucking tail and
well, how do I sell these hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they did a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we always see that every state that
opens up there's just a million quotes,
[SPEAKER_01]: truckloads being sent out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the tide goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see who's skinny dipping, which in
this business, it's very hard not to your
[SPEAKER_01]: text to hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your product's not getting better on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's aging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that while there's less
commercial growers, we're still,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're still selling a lot of commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the beginning, it was like,
who's going to do it though, because
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil wasn't a style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I think it's a total style and there's
commercial rows that want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of how many new ones are
opening under the current market
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and how many new ones are
opening under the current market
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions that are in love with living
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are like spreadsheeters
funded by venture capitalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just going to go with some
hydroponic model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the beginning, I know one of the
first big rows that I saw do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm sure you're aware of GLP Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we worked with them originally and
also someone from those same living
[SPEAKER_01]: organic soil forums, Matt Davenport.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there with all of us on the LoS
forums and the whole deal had a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember behind the scenes,
I don't know if he knows this or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: but gas and MGD and I were like,
bro, is this guy crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was like, we're going to have
facilities and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, everything he said came true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he definitely wasn't crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he and I have a great relationship
still.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he worked on that GLP Nevada one in
the beginning as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have like 30 something cycles
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been able to manage the business
side as well as the growing side,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're from what I can tell from
outside appearance, they're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the model has been proven.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of the girls that we work with,
I think are like one of them in New Mexico
[SPEAKER_01]: that we really love working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got what was called a micro license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really cool what they have
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like rolling beds that they
custom built and have like four small grow
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms with four beds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they harvest each room at a different
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were allowed to be fully vertical
in this micro license, make their own
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, sell their own cannabis,
grow their own cannabis, do it all under
[SPEAKER_01]: one roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those types of facilities,
I just love working with on Living Soil
[SPEAKER_01]: because it seems more like a Michelin star
restaurant than a franchise McDonald's
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where I think Living Soil
shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess to dive into some of the specifics
of their style, the thing that I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: say surprised me, but I was intrigued to
hear more about was Jake and Mark of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil Kings mentioned that everything they
do is really based around soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it like sort of mid cycle and at
the end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they top dress, it's based on
like a formulation to address that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific test they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, this is sort of
understandable on a commercial sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's quite in contrast to what you've
taught us on your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you do if you were going to do,
say the micro license you just described,
[SPEAKER_00]: would you want to do this really test
heavy approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's really tough to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is you can have an
answer in your head and then have someone
[SPEAKER_01]: put a gun to your head and see,
do you still have the same answer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And being in business is like having a gun
to your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we do other things for
insurance reasons to not only that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but can you imagine having a problem and
you're grown, not being able to tell your
[SPEAKER_01]: partner or investor why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he goes, well, do you have any
testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, well, the fuck's that for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to support when things are
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but it's hard to own that position
when things aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from a business perspective,
I think it's very, very important to do
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not as familiar with the level of
testing they do, but I believe they do
[SPEAKER_01]: once or twice through flower, which is
significantly more than other people would
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of, there's a lot of
things to consider there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd imagine I'd have to discuss it with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably doing a saturated pace
test, which is what's water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that makes sense because when
we do a soil test, you got to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: they take a thimble size scoop,
which might work for agricultural soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's very strange for potting soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have chunky stuff in there and they'll
either grind it or sift it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can drastically change the
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the lab that we work with,
I trust their soil testing results,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to test a regular soil test where they
take an acid, they dissolve the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance of soil into what its nutrient
components would be if fully utilized over
[SPEAKER_01]: a year or 10 years or however long it
took.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that doesn't make sense to test
that way twice during flower because I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, it's not really exactly what the
plant's tapping into.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of the soil profile,
but I'd imagine what they're doing is a
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated pace test, which is basically
putting water on the soil and deciding,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, if nutrients end up in the water,
then for sure, the plant's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: almost forced to take those up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is typically the soil
test is going to be based on cation
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange, which you could argue the plant
is going to exchange with to pick up what
[SPEAKER_01]: it wants when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need a balanced soil that's filling
your buffet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at the saturated pace
test, it's a test in my opinion of what
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be forced to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in an earth box, you have clean water
below and it can kind of bypass by taking
[SPEAKER_01]: clean water up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in typical in soil, especially in a
smaller container, those roots are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to drink the water for its
moisture needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to come with what's water
soluble regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you can consider that,
it would make sense to test a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: times during flower to say, Hey,
what's water soluble?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're almost looking for excesses
that would cause a lack in yield because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like too much sodium is being
released or not enough calcium or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you could probably tailor
a top dress if it was micronized enough or
[SPEAKER_01]: it had the key inputs that then you
watered through and would stimulate a
[SPEAKER_01]: change to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other times people are using,
I mean, SAP analysis of the leaf or tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of theories between
which one's more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, tissue is kind of a leading
indicator where the SAP is like
[SPEAKER_01]: instantaneous and it could be changing
multiple times per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows how accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people actually custom formulate
foliar sprays, especially in large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture based on the parts per million
in movement they want to see in the SAP
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can't help but to be reminded of
Masanobo Fukuoka thinking that the smarter
[SPEAKER_01]: you get, the less you know, so to speak,
almost like going down a rabbit hole too
[SPEAKER_01]: narrowly minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never accuse soil kings of doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you they're doing great and they're
able to back up what their gut says by
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a soil test evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're going to be throwing an
amendment at it and you have a soil test
[SPEAKER_01]: and something's lacking, I think it'd be
very hard not to want to add that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the data is going to be helpful
regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: The home grower, though, I think if
they're following basic principles,
[SPEAKER_01]: they should be totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those basic principles were harder to
understand until we did soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started, we would just whip
up Koot's mix and send it to the lab and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd read the soil test and it was
relatively similar to what I was seeing as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I'd have an expert say,
wow, you can't grow that much sodium or
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, this is way too much phosphorus or
whatever the particular person would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite all of that, the plants grew
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did kind of learn to take it with a
grain of salt, but we've been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically improve our soil based on the
type of inputs you have to mix together by
[SPEAKER_01]: doing soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a long answer and it's kind of
that black belt answer of it depends I
[SPEAKER_01]: think commercially, I would definitely do
it at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like, look, when you make
dinner, you know, to add some protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: some carbs, some veggies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know how to make a well-rounded
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have that basic level of
understanding the soil, you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just go at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 5% difference could be a huge
difference when it comes to the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil testing would be more important on
a commercial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can appreciate the extra benefit it's
going to bring on a commercial slash sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of job situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to round out the other end of that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our listeners, I suspect they may
not have got around to watching your
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube videos yet, but they basically
wanted to say, could you give us a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: overview?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an Australian grower, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not able to get a nutrient test or
a soil test, what's the general strategy
[SPEAKER_00]: for just reamending?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have one YouTube episode that goes
over specifically two methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done other episodes where we've done
soil testing, but I'll give you the high
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on, if you go to builduswell.com
and you go to the blog, the most recent
[SPEAKER_01]: one is like a blank blog.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you click on it, it's a form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put in your email and it gives you a
free report.
[SPEAKER_01]: That free report is how to make your own
custom organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that term COF, custom or sorry,
complete organic fertilizer, custom
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're making it, but it's
complete, was taught by Steve Solomon,
[SPEAKER_01]: the intelligent gardener who's now out
your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's interesting
because when I reference how he teaches
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it makes fundamental sense,
just like saying you should have some
[SPEAKER_01]: meat, you know, a protein, you should have
some greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is how you make a balanced meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, what the soil needs is your
complete organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way to make it is to follow these
ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can get that report and it
really does break down no matter where in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world you live, how to make a complete
organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we did in YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: This most recent series four in quadrant
two in the three by three bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results are stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy because we just made up the
top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't use craft blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't use like an off the shelf that
we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made it from scratch in our YouTube
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that title is, I think, reamending two
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is the title of that YouTube video
in season four more towards the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's before we planted and we grew
cover crop in the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I broke it all down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put my custom, my complete
organic fertilizer that we made on camera
[SPEAKER_01]: into the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember thinking, man, that's a lot
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I showed how to do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, it's doing really, really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting a great fade on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we overdid anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm confident we saw a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would reveal what I'm seeing as far as
plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the way we did that is also
understanding that we're two feet deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to soil on a farm,
you don't amend it two feet deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You amend the top six inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the fertility is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I treated it the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took my three by three bed, which is
nine cubic feet, and it's two feet deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's 18 cubic feet in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only amended really the top six
inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made my complete kit for four and a
half cubic feet based on the one to two
[SPEAKER_01]: cups of nutrients and two to four cups of
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that video, I break down all those
ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the complete report, you can see
Steve's version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we used to build a soil way
to basically duplicate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to go to build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just Google Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Complete organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find a million resources of
people talking about him as well as his
[SPEAKER_01]: own website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he has a growing in Tasmania,
like a whole edition on how to grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: that climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone go check out Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a cool little side note,
I was doing a consultation for one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal medical cannabis facilities in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, you guys should hit up
Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, we're already working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that he's just a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like zoomed him or Skyped him or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he answered and we started talking and
he would answer emails and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: unique relationships that I've developed
out of my curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like other curious,
passionate people are when they really
[SPEAKER_01]: tell that someone's on the same path,
they want to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Steve's been a big help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also encourages me to not take
everything so seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: He mentions organics will be the loudest,
but the least like you can put some trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals in some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can work with some of these others,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you read his book, you'll know what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are very pure about which
amendments and he's, he definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: discusses all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But his takeaway from the organics is of
some is better, more is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just throw compost at everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the balance of having his book while
growing organically, I think keeps it on
[SPEAKER_01]: track.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Steve's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one of the answers from one or two
questions ago, you mentioned a buzzword in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said micronized.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our listeners, I'm sure you've been
dealing with this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Slow Nickel on Instagram has
been causing quite a stir with his
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions around soluble calcium and
micronized calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to weigh in on that first at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to, but the guy hates me,
has blocked me, won't talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I basically have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: He exists because I can't see anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's been talking calcium forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes a ton of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't know why he's blocked
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's told me that we had a gentleman here,
Zach Branson.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been here forever in customer
service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was doing some of our soil testing
analysis using a lot of my methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that time, he picked up the
soil test calculator online that was
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about, I think by Steve Solomon and
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was using that as part of his
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically Slow Nickel reached out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And told me that we were ripping people
off by using some online calculator to do
[SPEAKER_01]: his job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just can't imagine that he thinks
that simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has to know that I was super passionate
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also worked with a local grower out
here and had that me make a soil mix for
[SPEAKER_01]: that grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suspect that he thinks we took some
of that tech into our build a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But realistically, I was learning from him
since day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main thing that I take from him is
that calcium is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just pounds it in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cannot discount him for that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from an agricultural level,
foliar sprays make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can bypass soil issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think people would lean on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from an ideal perspective where you
can get a potting soil design with lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium in it, low gypsum like you would
prefer, and not put as much pressure on a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop by having an abundance of soil,
I haven't seen a huge reason why you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to need to hammer foliar sprays of
micronized calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've certainly tried some products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not tried his.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ferda Organic makes a calcium carbonate
micronized powder that is suspendable and
[SPEAKER_01]: foliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the carbonates as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suspect, you know, Astera would not
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also slow nickel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was thinking the ideal soil for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get some of the agronomist interchange
in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But micronization makes sense to me like a
protein shake does for a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes effort to break down a steak in
your stomach, but it's pretty easy when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ground down into basically powder
that's so fine, you drink it in liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of what I mentioned
before, how you get a faster result from
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these powders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So micronization doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're going to make compost,
you don't want to put a whole branch in
[SPEAKER_01]: there to make compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to chop it up into wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates more surface area for the
biology to work on, which means you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get a faster, more duplicatable
result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So micronization is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they certainly make sense under
corrective conditions or when there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've ever overwatered, I'll immediately
bust out like aminos and a calcium foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure that I can try and get
nutrition to the plant while maybe it
[SPEAKER_01]: can't drink on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as his specific conversation,
I've got no clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd imagine it's a little bit of the same
that he's always been discussing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, I think you covered the dot
points really nicely just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to change topics for a moment
because you have inspired both me and a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of other people to sort of give
growing their own vegetables a good whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing cannabis, you can
definitely grow your own veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think many people, including myself
over the past two years, have been
[SPEAKER_00]: following your adventure with the family
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us just some of the dot
points of what you've learned and just any
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts in terms of encouraging people to
grow some of their own food?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife runs the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows a lot more and has learned all
these lessons firsthand about how hard the
[SPEAKER_01]: work is, how much planning is involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will tell you, she's upped my belief
in what we do because of the success that
[SPEAKER_01]: she's able to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's always had just a knack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when we first met at our first
dinner, we were talking about growing
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and ended up visiting her and
finding out that she had it just covered
[SPEAKER_01]: full of jars from an outdoor that she'd
pulled down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I would love.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really took it a step further when
I saw what looked like hydroponic catalog
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine photo shoot of tomatoes growing
on one vine up to the ceiling with just a
[SPEAKER_01]: rainbow of rasta from red to yellow to
green in every color of transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really did think that these cocoa
nutrient growers were the only ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: could fill a greenhouse like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought organic tomato production
might look like just bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when she started doing what I found
out, it was the training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously training is huge when it
comes to indoor growing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just grow naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you manage a slightly more flat
canopy, that's even to our light,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get more yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I saw her start to manage the
single lead on the tomato plant and tie
[SPEAKER_01]: them to the string and attach them and get
them to grow and knowing that underneath
[SPEAKER_01]: was just worms and some of the amendments
we put in following the typical living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil style.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unbelievable, the production level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been every year and the cucumbers
in that group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just really upped my level of belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, my God, this works
phenomenally well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coupling that with the fact that in
the outdoor field, you can get good
[SPEAKER_01]: results as well based on some limited soil
testing and some basic amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It upped my belief in that building soil
is very, very possible for the average
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our alkaline soil in this basically
parking lot, we built the front area and
[SPEAKER_01]: not parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just flat compacted dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did a soil test and saw that there
was like not excessive sodium or any
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, we amended each bed with a little
bit of compost, tiny bit of peat,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because it's acidic and adds organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was very low organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put some basic amendments in and
we're able to produce that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have waited and cover cropped and
done the slower process, but we wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce results right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that worked, I was thinking,
oh, my goodness, all this stuff works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything we've been learning about
indoors, it translates fully to outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allowed me to gain confidence from
her activity, all the hard work she put
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say some of the things that I
didn't see coming was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to have perfect lettuce beds and to be
able to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can't use mulch in there because
now you need a, it's basically covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the soil doesn't need mulch if it's
covered by the living plants, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: living mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're using a greens harvester for
a restaurant and it starts cutting up
[SPEAKER_01]: straw in there, like that's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or rocks, you know, you're trying to use a
seeding machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously plants grow through it in your
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to pick all the rocks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just plant the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start running down a road,
perfectly straight with exact spacing on a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed machine, that's going to,
you know, divot the soil and drop a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds in going to the next one rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it's just, it fumbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you can see dialing it in
instead of in an indoor tent where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what's the humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot control that outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can control is the tilt texture,
the uniformity of the seeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: the watering, and every single lesson that
she's learned over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've brainstormed together has been
harder than anticipated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for what it's worth, I think it's
really rewarding, but it's also not in
[SPEAKER_01]: our, on our own personal, like it's not at
our house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that I think would be
more rewarding is if it was like a true
[SPEAKER_01]: farm where your house is there and your
crops are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can give them so much more love
in the evenings and spend time walking
[SPEAKER_01]: through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we live far enough away where we kind
of miss out on some of that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just things that we've that I'm
observing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant message there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'd love to ask you,
I know that in myself, I tried to grow my
[SPEAKER_00]: own fruit and veggies a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like when I was growing,
so I had the skills, but I think the error
[SPEAKER_00]: I made was I selected all the wrong stuff,
you know, stuff I don't, stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't produce lots of fruit or stuff
that doesn't grow quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your recommendations for things
that are going to, you know, earn their
[SPEAKER_00]: spot in a little home garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's important in a home garden
is you know, the way that we live,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's unlikely that you're going to replace
a hundred percent of your meals from your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, unless you really have this desire
to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to do that, but I don't
want that to take away from your desire to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow because sometimes it's all or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you throw that idea out the window
and think, okay, as long as I get some
[SPEAKER_01]: production, now it becomes, which crops
could I actually add to a lot of the meals
[SPEAKER_01]: that I already eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in essence, eat living, vital food,
full of enzymes, full of the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that was on it, no pesticides,
like this is the goods, this is what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since gut health is important,
I think even some is better than none
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're stimulating that biology,
you're adding all these natural foods and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're harvested minutes ago or hours ago
instead of shipped all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the food kind of dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like vital when you eat it fresh out
of your own garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that regard, like,
I think every single person should grow
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of mixed greens in a small space
and you can come harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, they need to be harvested
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not, they'll bolt and they grow
unwieldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so learning that I would just harvest
even if I didn't need it, which would have
[SPEAKER_01]: me eating more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you can do is, you know,
you can add them on your cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add them in your tacos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add them with your eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add them to meals that you may
already be making instead of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: change your entire life philosophy
overnight to eat only vegetables from your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I noticed is a lot of us
want to grow really cool plants that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: never heard of because that's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we ended up not eating them
because you're like, I don't even know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to cook this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure when it's going to be
ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that what's most important is
stick to the basics of stuff that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going to eat and grow that at a
minimum so that you at least get that
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, greens really stimulate a lot
of what I eat super quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radishes are great because they're really
fast, but not everybody likes the flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, chopping them up and learning new
ways to cook as part of that, adding them
[SPEAKER_01]: to tacos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then tomatoes, while I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the stuff that produces
consistently day in and day out can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I mentioned the greens,
having your own carrots, delicious,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does take a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to look at the number of
days that it takes to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can kind of take away from it
because you wait all year, then you get 10
[SPEAKER_01]: carrots and you eat them and it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do last a while, but I just do
think that I, I focused on like tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: and peppers when I first started gardening
and not the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now mainly I just plant like lettuce
right away because it grows so quick and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can eat it without, you know, all the
meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess consider that gross stuff that
you're actually going to eat and you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: really well rewarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's exactly what I've gotten
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I wrote down all the, the veggies I eat
regularly and then figured which ones grow
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and went from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my, my one I pass onto people
is Lebanese cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, you get like a new cucumber every two
days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like salad, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pickles, you can make pickles out of
all the cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, they're so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quick ones too, even in vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lady just made the first jar of pickles
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a mind reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you, so I grew,
I grew these cucumbers outside and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was in just like,
just some soil in the front of my house
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was, you know, it was all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I got a high quality soil from
organic gardening solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially the same as your 3.0
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so much more cucumbers from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to ask you, have you ever
done like a basic analysis and figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you get a return big enough to
merit buying a high quality soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think you should just use what
you got, keep it cheap because it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: food and you know, like you just,
just plant more plants or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've never done a site, you know,
in a mathematical analysis to determine
[SPEAKER_01]: because I just want the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to produce the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really enjoy that knowing that
everything in there that's going into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with, but somewhat hypocritical on
our vegetable farm, the cucumbers weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: just that native soil that we emit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're gangbusters at the production
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable, but we did put premium
compost and amendments in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at the end of the day,
you got to do what makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're growing for food purposes,
I at least want it to not be lacking in
[SPEAKER_01]: key elements that would either lead to an
unhealthy plant or something that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to last as long in the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you from the vegetable farm,
when my wife produces it, the lettuce
[SPEAKER_01]: lasts for weeks in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cucumbers are unbelievably good
texture and last much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's certainly benefit to having a
nutrient dense food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what happens is in these cheaper
soils, it's not like you're getting just
[SPEAKER_01]: less.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting imbalance and excesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excesses in sodium, other things that just
cause a lack in production, flowers to
[SPEAKER_01]: fall off, disease to set in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on one hand, it's almost like if
you buy a tool that doesn't completely do
[SPEAKER_01]: the job, you've wasted all of your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you spend a little more on a
premium tool and at least does the job and
[SPEAKER_01]: does it well, I don't think you can call
that wasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always consider it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, when it comes to production,
I really feel like you can get away with
[SPEAKER_01]: some very cost effective things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make your own compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make your own amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes more effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an exchange there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always some opportunity cost,
but I do get much better results too and
[SPEAKER_01]: using our more premium soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proofs in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a last sort of question on this
general topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the listeners and myself had sort of
had this common observation that builder
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is moving very much in this more
education orientated direction where not
[SPEAKER_00]: just are you selling the products,
but you really want to try to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: people on how to use them and all the nuts
and bolts behind the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this the end goal for you or did it
just sort of come about like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's always been the goal,
but it's also out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, you sell a lot of
products, people buy them and use them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you sell gardening products and people
have some very strange questions and they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to know exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's hard to have all of
our customer service, even though they are
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, they have different styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to put the build a soil way sort of
in place was to allow freedom for our
[SPEAKER_01]: customers to understand how I might answer
their question and help them along the
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since the beginning, build as well as
really our goal was to help empower
[SPEAKER_01]: organic minded growers with the best
quality products and free education.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beginning, it was more every single
person I talked to educate, but when
[SPEAKER_01]: there's hundreds of thousands,
it makes a lot more sense to document and
[SPEAKER_01]: start to build on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a natural evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was our plan from the
beginning, but Dean helped with YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're already building some other
education content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to keep going down
that path and see how it works for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that making things more accessible
really, really helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people might want to try to grow
the organic way, but when they go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro store and they're given a part A and
part D with exact directions from start to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish, it can give them that confidence
looking three months in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they're going to make it all the way
to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an exact method to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it came to the organic style,
it was like, well, good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be a weirdo and read all this
stuff and understand this versus that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that kept a lot of people
out of it, which kind of is why it was
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody could do it, but at the end
of the day, I would rather that 80% of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that would avoid that because of
all the effort, I want them to experience
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefits as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the education, I think really
brings it down to a level where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of people out there make
these scientific posts about calcium and
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taught a long time ago that what
we're after is the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can geek out on the science all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the average customer, they just want
to know, well, this work and how do I do
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the science behind every single
detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as you get success, it allows you
that freedom to start to be very curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember my first grow, it was like,
how do I get herb now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I just, I want to justify
this light and those seeds I just bought
[SPEAKER_01]: and I need production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, when you realize you
could be growing all the time and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: more than enough, I think you start to
really ask a lot deeper questions.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can relate to that hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to touch on this topic because it
seems like amendments and strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion, it comes back periodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a lot of focal discussion more
recently around the age old white ash
[SPEAKER_00]: debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it changed at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think if you're growing
organically, does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've actually never seen properly
organic grown bud that doesn't go to white
[SPEAKER_00]: ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it just doesn't apply to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also, even when I say it,
I feel like it kind of does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely seen some organic that
won't burn all the way down to a white
[SPEAKER_01]: ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that is the method in which
it's smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, you know, you just put a
lighter to a bowl and you kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: burn the good stuff off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not incinerate all the way down to
its white ash by really exhausting it like
[SPEAKER_01]: you would if you put it in a joint where
it burns all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certain times, certain herbs,
I've just rolled up and they don't burn as
[SPEAKER_01]: white as others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that some of that's genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do know that if I, smoke some hydro
and it's burning solid white, like just
[SPEAKER_01]: white, white, and it seems light on the
inhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost feel like it's like, like a light
cigarette or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just like a light, like I
explained that like, yes, there is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanly feel to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's what they're getting at,
but seriously greasy, potent, terpy herb
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of has a tingle to it, you know,
even if it burns white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's hard to relate one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say, oh, it's easier on your lungs
and it's clean because that's how you
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, some of the most potent
herb makes me, I mean, it makes me want to
[SPEAKER_01]: take my jacket off and cough and
everything else, just because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it depends on the time of day,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't pin it down exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that some of the arguments like
tobacco, it's the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen content may make some
difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking the flower and there's resin
and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when you do like a tissue test,
you know, there's not, it's not like you
[SPEAKER_01]: see all these elements in there that
you're going to reduce down to some
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous level and flushing oftentimes
just cause mobilization of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in the leaf to move into the
flower and it's still consuming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, I will say that
when I have a good harvest and I let it go
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way to senescence, I let it
complete its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like I always burn white and it's
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other people that are like one
speck of black in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means it doesn't burn white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, whatever is the herb
good?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, does it taste good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it get you high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very vague just because I don't have
a one sided opinion there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked so much herb that didn't
follow every one of these rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my opinion is, is it good?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took me back to that famous story of
like, I think it was like the 2015 Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup or something where like the winning
sample was found to have mold in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the judges were like, I just picked
little bits of bud around the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, still great smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like obviously not the exact same,
but it goes to prove the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is it good?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's all these other
variables, but interesting stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a bit of a technical one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Australia, it's notably hard to find
certain types of bone meal, fish bone
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you find is a few companies,
I don't know whether it's just a mistake
[SPEAKER_00]: or whether it's like purposely
mis-advertising it, but they'll sell fish
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the whole fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like a lot of nitrogen in it
and relatively a small amount of bone in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, if bone meal is a little
harder to find and someone's looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a nice organic source of phosphorus in
their mixture, I historically have
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended wheat bran because there's
certain varieties that have nice
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something you might opt for
instead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we use an organic rice bran.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 6% available phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you got to understand when
you're talking available, that's a high
[SPEAKER_01]: number because you buy like calcium
phosphate mineral and it'd be 3%
[SPEAKER_01]: available, 20% total.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting double that out of an organic
bran, I thought, wow, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recently keyed into the bran thing
and that's what we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that is because some of the
phosphorus sources can have heavy metals
[SPEAKER_01]: in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to avoid that at all costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium phosphate has some cadmium in it,
depending on the source can go up and
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same mine can fluctuate a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've stayed away from that in our soil
recipes, although calcium phosphate has a
[SPEAKER_01]: very high reputation when it comes to soil
testing books and building soil and the
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of me wants to stick with
that, that mineral colloidal, that clay
[SPEAKER_01]: based version, but I also want to be as
clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are where some of those nuances
come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bone meal, I think provides really good
calcium and phosphorus, but I know I could
[SPEAKER_01]: be wrong, but I think down under the
phosphorus, it's a bigger deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, it's not as naturally high
in phosphorus ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could affect the water more like
there's problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even fertilizer companies are
restricted on the level of phosphorus that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can offer on even like hydroponic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's partly why some of the
bone meal is not as popular, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause spreading copious levels of
phosphorus across the farm may not have
[SPEAKER_01]: produced an industry where it's available,
but I will notice when I test a fish bone
[SPEAKER_01]: meal that I purchased here versus fish
meal, sometimes I'll see very similar
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers and one appears to be a lot more
bone, but sometimes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see some nitrogen sometimes even
in the bone meal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the board, but they seem to always
have the phosphorus they promise because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going towards a minimum guarantee
on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to minimum guarantee,
they can be a lot higher without any
[SPEAKER_01]: penalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone could tell you this is a one,
a 10, two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it could have a 10, 10, two,
and it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only guaranteed at least it have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't tell you that 9% more than
they promised.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're calculating and buying it,
you'd have wished to know what the extra
[SPEAKER_01]: was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So testing on your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: On big farms is advisable, but heavy
metals are the inverse, depending on which
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was just having a conversation
about this, but Washington mandates you to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell them the maximum that it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ever go over it, that's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that led to a lot of people saying,
well, okay, the max is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm testing here, but if it ever
fluctuates, I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where on the NPK, it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say, well, I'll pick the lowest number
because if it ever goes over, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always must be over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding that might be helpful,
but phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was some companies trying to make
organic phosphorus sources out of like
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and maybe some capacity there,
but the seed meals that we've tested seem
[SPEAKER_01]: to not be very high in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One material that seemed to come back
pretty well was the insect frass,
[SPEAKER_01]: not as much as the brand, but it did have
more diversity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the brand, it makes our
solar heat up probably because the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not terrible, but that's one
thing that the bone meal doesn't quite do
[SPEAKER_01]: the same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't come as much carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would carry steamed bone meal,
but I can't find any, it's not like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's any farms that are saying this is
just from cattle that have been fed
[SPEAKER_01]: organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's like pig and cattle and
everything fed everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just some big facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of why I've stayed away
with fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sodium can be a little bit of an
issue, but most companies that produce a
[SPEAKER_01]: good product, it's not really a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just more against the soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're already high sodium,
there could be other advantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like foliar spray, really soil,
I guess, like Organics Alive has some
[SPEAKER_01]: powders and stuff, but that's very
different than asking about amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny you mentioned Brent,
because that's what we've added into 3.0
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these others to keep P high while
we pulled some of the other materials that
[SPEAKER_01]: could fluctuate with heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm really glad to hear that because I
was worried for the past few years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might've been giving out the wrong
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and some brand doesn't have as high
of P. And so I know that Terraganics is
[SPEAKER_01]: the company that distributes Emeralds EM1
here and used to be owned by a guy that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole other story that I'm
not really happy about how that all
[SPEAKER_01]: process work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, they were using a brand and
they claimed an MPK level on like a brand
[SPEAKER_01]: compost mixture or something for Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they ended up having to start to add
other inputs because the P dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a batch of wheat brand that they were
buying or rice brand that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so fluctuations can definitely occur
in natural products based on the farm that
[SPEAKER_01]: it was growing on and how it was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say Fishbone Meal is always
going to have phosphorus brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to maybe inspect
somehow if they have a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these companies will share
their tests with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may have a label that says 111.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be like, Hey, do you have an actual
MPK test like on your brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might come back 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah, that's the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that sort of relating to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our listeners also chimed in
with a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was sort of just amalgamated two
questions together in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've noticed when I do top dress with
something like wheat brand or just even
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the general amendments I use,
I get this massive explosion in beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: population, like notably hypoapsis and
what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rove beetles, roly polies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I feel like the population
maybe explodes a little too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this is just a reflection of
me needing to top dress a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter or like what's your
thoughts on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the stuff that everybody that
grows living soil knows, but it's not as
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rove beetles are a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great, but they get in your herb
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They end up growing wings and flying
around and they'll climb up on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of like, well,
you're getting rid of the fungus now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now you have, it's like trading one
for the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, if I grab some nugs,
I'll make sure that I just take a quick
[SPEAKER_01]: peek and make sure I'm not smoking a rove
beetle or something, but it's really more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a minor nuisance, especially when
you're keeping things in balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did notice the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even had some customers, you see
every end of the spectrum here when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going, working with thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had some customers that have
reached out and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have these little tiny, slow moving bulb
mites or orb mites, depending on what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very slow moving, round, bulbous looking
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see them on the, on the woodier
material on seed meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll just be decomposing it and so
much so that you can have like hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've noticed it that if the humidity
is really high and you have tons of fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: chopped leaf mulch and lots of amendments
in there, it just stays in ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions for them to the part where you
can actually see them climbing up the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while most people do a defoliation and
a cleanup, and by the time flower comes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to see any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually had some customers that had
to point out to me that they were having a
[SPEAKER_01]: major issue and I didn't believe them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd send me photos and I'm like,
Oh my God, they're in your bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would lead, you know, inevitably
we'd find out they just had cover crop
[SPEAKER_01]: going wild and a million things top
dressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just conducive to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while nature is good, it's all about
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I was
fascinated with early on with starting
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil systems is that early on you'd
see population explosions and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: would die back and you see something else
come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually it's kind of like you
create this homeostasis of different
[SPEAKER_01]: activities going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like they're not all going
out of control, but we're in a perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had Rolly-Pollies, like you
mentioned, go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only happened once, but it was to the
point where they were starting to eat my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and strip my stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in that particular time I was
using like a lot of woody mulch and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just weren't proliferating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was from their compost that I had
gotten at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other times it's, you know,
the Rove Beetles or Mites, but for the
[SPEAKER_01]: most part, when you're top dressing every
once in a while and you're following like
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning up the actual airflow by
defolding a little bit, we're indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have all the environment to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that things stay pretty much in
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe what you keyed on is top dress
slightly less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think less is more, you know,
I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been able to do more with less than I
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm reamending, like I did that
three by three bed, we broke down all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop in there and then we mixed all
those amendments in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It broke down into something great,
but it's different when you have the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: decay in worms and the plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see those weird population explosions
away from the light, in the shade,
[SPEAKER_01]: hidden under the mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you have any specific
instance that was like problematic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for most of mine, I just kind of like,
no, let's see what happens and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid being overly concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically it takes care of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may strip out a mulch layer and really
reapply some straw or something if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: really concerned that something was
getting too wild, just because I can throw
[SPEAKER_01]: in the compost bin or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of problems in organics,
I think are caused by like chasing your
[SPEAKER_01]: own tail a little too hard, trying to
cheat, like treat a couple of excessive
[SPEAKER_01]: population in the soil and almost hurting
your plants to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just remember that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the exact situation you described
and for anyone listening, you can remedy
[SPEAKER_00]: it exactly as Jeremy said, you know,
like just, just take some of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing off and start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a similar predicament to one of
your customers where I dead set had these
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials crawling up towards the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of what instigated me to
remove the top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another thing I did, which a lot of
people say is helpful to hear is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of, you remove the top dress,
but you can also just get some tape and
[SPEAKER_00]: just put it reverse around the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if anything starts to crawl up,
it'll just get stuck there on that bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the next day or two,
it'll, as you've taken the mulch,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll settle down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, it'll, it'll come back to
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had people like with rolly pollies,
for instance, you can put some tangle foot
[SPEAKER_01]: gel on there, some tape, but they climb
up, die on the tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other bodies just crawl over
the dead ones on the tape and bypass it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature's going to find a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uncanny.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, airflow is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times we don't have any
airflow underneath the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can defoliate and clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always recommend below our like
Scrog screen or the level at which we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to flip the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything below be stripped off called
strip in the legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you defoli underneath because
it's not like the sun where there's space
[SPEAKER_01]: between plants and it's going around it in
like an arch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's flat and you're going to completely
grow the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything below it is devoid of
light and is in a different environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: a much different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates this micro climate,
but adding a little fan to have some
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow underneath that canopy discourages
it, I think from being proliferated with
[SPEAKER_01]: such an abundance of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it encourages that life to stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is we're not killing
anything, but we're self limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like worms aren't going to produce a
billion worms with no food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to self limit according to
the container that they're in,
[SPEAKER_01]: the size and the feed intake, because they
just can't, they're going to run out just
[SPEAKER_01]: like humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you provide an environment that is
unlimited buffet and no airflow,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the humidity and the cover crop goes
up to your plants and they can climb up
[SPEAKER_01]: the stock and they're just going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they overpopulate, they're going to
run out of room and food and they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to start to migrate and it'll become a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so knowing that, I think that if you
see our grows, we never like, by the time
[SPEAKER_01]: flower comes, the cover crops kind of died
down with, we've muddled it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're not top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when it comes to during a grow,
we don't pile it on like we do if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: reamending very light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that helps adding some
airflow makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also because biology is dependent on
moisture and we even preach this keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: things moist in that mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have the mulch, it's moist
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people come and they wet the top
like every single day just to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: it's moist under the mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, I think you might be
proliferating some of those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our desire to overcare and over love
sometimes can lead to these situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we ended up killing it with kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just before you mentioned, you know,
having things perfectly dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, because I think
you've going to have a good personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with this more notably within
the soil less growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cocoa, rock wool, that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sort of a robust discussion going
on about at the moment about whether new
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are actually as good as the old HIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see some big name figures being
like, I'm switching back to double ends,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the LEDs are better and you just
got to dial in your room to a fit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a while to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were burned by some of these early LED
companies that were blur pole or not the
[SPEAKER_01]: good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like nowadays when you're
looking at it, there's differences in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and they are different the way that
they operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without understanding that you're
definitely going to get different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also do feel like some of the older
heads are experiencing a certain profile
[SPEAKER_01]: from their certain cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to get when they grow out
their way, you know, I mean, some guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: charcoal, some guys are wood pellet and
some guys are only, you know, propane or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they can all cook, cook the same
meal, but it might be a slightly different
[SPEAKER_01]: profile that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And HIDs may contribute to that,
but when it comes to a newer grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get the best out of their
plants, the best for their environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best yield, the best taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's no one right way,
but LED fits the most opportunity there
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it used to not, the yield wasn't as
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality was arguably different because
it would, they would focus on their lack
[SPEAKER_01]: of potency out of the LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the marketing in the beginning
was get a hundred watt light and it
[SPEAKER_01]: replaces a thousand and they'd say it's
because they are using like the specific
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum to highlight on the areas and
eliminate all the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that quickly went out the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we can tell with LED, it's full
spectrum, just like the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of it's waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant needs all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once it returned to that,
I feel like then LED was on the right
[SPEAKER_01]: path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they said, you know what,
if a thousand Watts is good, then a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand Watts is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started making big LEDs and there
is a difference in how that energy is
[SPEAKER_01]: used, but a watt is a watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really do feel like it was
misleading to tell people, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use a 500 watt LED and produce the
same as a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you kind of can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what I mean by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand Watts with the glass hood that
gets dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's overdoing the potency rate near
your plant, but not as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduces from the actual light output.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LEDs, it's raw right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be far, depending on if it's a
little strip surface, the big cobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now there's a tool for every capacity,
but the main difference I've noticed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've probably experienced this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I will say that I like about HID
is this, it's more of a single source,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the sun, it's like a bulb and it
feels warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're on the beach and I feel
like the plants probably react well to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I've learned is if you're
going to use this, this term, the VPD,
[SPEAKER_01]: the vapor pressure deficit, what they
encourage you to do is take your
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and have it relative to your
humidity in a way that the plant likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we forget is that's the plant's
leaf temperature that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're using a double in that
HID, you're going to have a 70 degree grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room with like an 80 degree leaf
temperature or higher, depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: close to the light it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in an LED, you could have a 75 degree
grow room and a 68 degree leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like the heat is dissipating
off the back of the LED, off the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not being projected down in a way
that feels warm on your skin the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's warmth in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know some people are like,
Oh, you don't have to use an air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioner if you use LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, if it's a hundred degrees
out, and you have an LED, it's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be 80 degrees in your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just, it doesn't invert because
energy is energy, but that is a difference
[SPEAKER_01]: how it projects onto the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I've learned is that managing,
I mean, they are some unbelievable
[SPEAKER_01]: horsepower in these LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HID with all that horsepower,
I will say when people went from single
[SPEAKER_01]: ended and then went to double ended,
the same learning curve happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of guys would fry their whole grow
because these double ended, they needed a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need more ceiling height because they
blast LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think, Oh, this little LED,
they are potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take an LED, that's the new
technology and you put it six inches from
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant, you can be blasting them with
like 1500 PAR, just like you could with a
[SPEAKER_01]: double ended LED that got too close to the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of that learning curve is,
Hey, you can back these things way off and
[SPEAKER_01]: get phenomenal growth, but you probably
want to have a warmer grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now at 80, 85 degrees in your grow
room, now your leaf surface temperature is
[SPEAKER_01]: closer to what it would have been under a
70 degree grow room with HID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what happens is because of the leaf
surface temperature is proper,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it starts drinking water at a faster
rate and transpiring slightly faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's using its nutrients,
which means it's going to be yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did see a number of people are
like, you need more CalMag under an LED or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the supposition was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think it was more related to what I
call or what the industry calls DLI or
[SPEAKER_01]: daily lighting integral.
[SPEAKER_01]: That relates to the potency of the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you couple that with the fact
that most people think you just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: overdo light and they get this new LED and
you can overdo it, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing 20 hours on like in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that nuance is what eliminated a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if I'm a snowboarder and
someone tells me skiing is all the rage
[SPEAKER_01]: and I try and don't like it, I'm just
going back to snowboarding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to like stick to it for two
years and figure that out and change
[SPEAKER_01]: everything I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get why people would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would stay, but I think, man,
I think Swale Kings did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they switched over to LED recently
after doing, you know, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they probably had some very good
reasons based on data and probably their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers' opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I am really impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use all LED in all of our new setups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to that CMH, Ceramic Metal Halide,
although not as big as the, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: they make double-endets now.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, that was my favorite light for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just healthy plants out of those
CMHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I think I attribute it to is the
315 is the most popular and guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's way weaker, which means I was
growing very healthy plants by following
[SPEAKER_01]: the DLI rule of not overdoing the light
without really knowing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was told it was just a healthier
full spectrum light, but I think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: the warmth from the CMH.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that it wasn't too intense when
you're like a foot away, it became totally
[SPEAKER_01]: palatable and it was full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it wasn't the light, it was the
full spectrum, the distance, like all
[SPEAKER_01]: those things combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once you understand that LED is
just crush, I think they work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, once you get used to it,
it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you about the use of the
QXtract or saponins in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel that there's any issues using
them, say, every watering or would you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to space it out a bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do anything every time,
but I will say wedding agents are one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those that I feel more comfortable with
adding in almost every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's say you take a shower and
every single time you soap, it's no
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may dry your skin out just slightly or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different than what we're talking
about, but you also don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you didn't go hard that day,
you're just taking a shower to warm up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not, you know, it's similar in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can add the Q every time,
but if your soil is decently moist,
[SPEAKER_01]: are we really adding a benefit as far as
distributing the moisture evenly?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, once it's nice and wet,
it's nice and wet, but I then saw Jay
[SPEAKER_01]: Plantspeaker when we kind of collabed on
this product together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was experiencing larger trichome head
size from using what he thought was the Q
[SPEAKER_01]: and was able to correlate that to the bag
size in washing his hash into the
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulation from the same plant,
putting all of its resin heads in a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: bag than before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're like, oh, okay, so we're
getting a higher percentage of this
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome head size versus the smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And either it was more uniformly large or
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he correlated a lot of that back to
the saponin use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I do believe that, I don't have
all the evidence to share that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't tell someone that guaranteed
they're going to increase their trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: size or something, but that seems to be a
lot of the correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing is Koot
encouraged me to look at saponins as a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth promoter, not just a wetting
agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a secondary plant compound,
it seems to have some benefits to soil
[SPEAKER_01]: biology and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like that just for motility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you ever looked under a microscope
and you see stuff moving that isn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: moving, it's like moving in the water
under the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not actively going against the
current.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're talking about biology,
a lot of times it's limited to as little
[SPEAKER_01]: range and you put the slippery Q in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it can allow things to move
around slightly more, but some of that may
[SPEAKER_01]: be just my imagination going wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of all the products, the wetting
agents are the ones that have added the
[SPEAKER_01]: most to the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even still, I don't do it every single
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost the purest of me was like,
ah, I got to get some straight water in
[SPEAKER_01]: here, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But even on commercial grows, like,
man, just adding that wetting agent,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be for foliar, just watering
the seedlings, like it just made the job
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water wouldn't just run out the bottom
as quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You knew that it was going to go wall to
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never seen someone overdo it when
they're adding these tiny bits of wetting
[SPEAKER_01]: agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like there's not a negative,
but if there isn't a huge upside to doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it every time, then it's going to affect
the budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I feel like the less is more is
probably the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to foliar sprays,
I pretty much add it to everyone though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like waxing your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you want that to beat up and
micronize beads on there and have an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want big drops just rolling off
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at JDOM, that's where I
learned some of that from as far as every
[SPEAKER_01]: single spray that they make has that JDOM
wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, using the extract of a bark is
slightly more natural than making a
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium hydroxide liquid soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I steal from JDOM what I like,
and I love the JDOM wetting agent,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's better for foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want something for the soil,
the soap bark, the kyuya or the yucca or
[SPEAKER_01]: all these other ones, it makes a ton of
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that helps answer the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a follow-up one, the tap water
where I live at the moment, it's shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like pH eight and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using just like some
lactobacillus just as an organic pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been finding I've been getting good
results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know, do you think there's any
issue doing that long-term?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out here, we have pretty alkaline
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're water testing, high pH is
different than alkalinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we're talking the same
thing as far as alkaline is above seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: but alkalinity can actually be like
bicarbonate and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that add alkaline to the water
instead of just a high pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously the pH has to come from
somewhere, but when it comes from problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with alkalinity, treating it with an acid
is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's weird to hear me say that because
a lot of people are like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: why would you use pH up or pH down or
anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you're building soil,
the pH is the culmination of what the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: is made out of, the calcium, the
potassium, all these building blocks make
[SPEAKER_01]: that pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you add water, you're not going
to change the entire structure of your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, which means you're not changing the
pH, which means it's kind of a waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in hydro, if you change the pH,
all the nutrients are dictated upon that
[SPEAKER_01]: water having the right pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it changes everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in farming, it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, like we first learned this
with our LOS, all of your Malibu,
[SPEAKER_01]: we add a lot of oyster shell flour based
on Coots recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you have a lot of oyster shell
flour in your soil and then your ditch
[SPEAKER_01]: water that you're using instead of
filtered water has a lot of alkalinity in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the biology can go to work on this
oyster shell flour and separate the
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium from the carbonate and release the
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put water in it that
immediately binds it back into calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nature has this way of like,
it's attractive to like combining things
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be a problem because you
never, your plant can't get access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're always adding an acid,
like the fruit growers around here,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have alkaline soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're growing peaches,
a lot of them will inject, it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet water system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll actually create sulfur from the
pellets and inject it right into the
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it's not like they're
trying to lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to cure this calcium
availability issue that's constantly being
[SPEAKER_01]: bound up by the alkaline water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I understood that, I'm like,
oh, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even in living soil, if the water is
dirty and you don't have filtered water,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's causing lots of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: pHing it could actually do more than pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could eliminate by acidifying that
alkaline bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, I mean, people would just put
vinegar in their ditch out here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: farms and make a huge difference by the
time it would dilute and go out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do believe that's a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these labs absolutely are very,
very low pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, EM1 that was used and sold
into many other industries besides
[SPEAKER_01]: farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them that Eric Lancaster was
always telling me about was de-scaling the
[SPEAKER_01]: buildup on like these industrial
complexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, de-scaling the water by
acidifying, that's kind of a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: thought process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, lactobacillus is ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason why sauerkraut works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just chop it up, put some salt,
you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, I can't see a problem with it
like at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, one of my favorite new
products, I'm not sure if you've heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an employee here and makes it,
it's called Yahweh Thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Thrive N.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrive is a word that he really liked,
but it is a labs, but what he does is he
[SPEAKER_01]: takes raw organic local grass fed milk,
which you can't buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, I mean, like buying raw milk is
a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you have to own a share of the
cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course labs are great, but using raw
milk is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then instead of just doing like a rice
wash water to make his own labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: he uses expensive kefir grains that he's
cultivated as pets to grow into a large
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he can make labs out of a kefir that
separates that raw milk into a liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: whey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he bottles the liquid whey,
stabilizes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you, I told him to do it
because I like, I used kefir at my house
[SPEAKER_01]: and when it would separate too far,
cause I'd wait a day, I pour that as my
[SPEAKER_01]: labs and I always had good results,
but I always had little bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could never like do a whole grow with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I first got that product,
I'm like, okay, I'll try it for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because I want to be a good guy
and I used it and the plants were like the
[SPEAKER_01]: next day and I'm like, okay, what do we
have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been one of our bestselling
products as of recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, in the most recent YouTube
series, we've been adding that at one
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce per gallon to the reservoir in this
autopot system that sub irrigates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of the reason we were
able to get it to work is because that
[SPEAKER_01]: labs was constantly in there, like
creating this environment where it may
[SPEAKER_01]: have been anaerobic in the bottom of those
containers, but it allowed it to work
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's how labs works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So man, I would keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got one more question for you before we
jump onto a few fan submitted ones before
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed on the website, you guys have a
killer new product, mustard seed meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, I've thought of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used mustard the plant as a cover
crop and had reasonable success for the
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you specifically,
what's the IPM properties like on the
[SPEAKER_00]: mustard meal?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the mustard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does it smell so good when it
hits the soil, like when we have a fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: batch, it goes in, it's like wasabi or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why we did it is we really
are after good clean sources of seed meal
[SPEAKER_01]: from caranja and neem cake and camelina,
which is a wild flax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of Steve Solomon's saying,
Hey, in a complete organic fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: a seed meal is a very important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think of people that eat vegan or
vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you don't have seeds and beans
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to have any protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's like the peak of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's putting all its effort into
the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I found interesting is that these
producers, we get them from out of
[SPEAKER_01]: California, they would help organic
strawberry producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the strawberries are very prone to
getting these fungal problems and ruins
[SPEAKER_01]: all your crop expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they would do is they treat
the soil with these awful chemicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they plant the strawberries and
that would fumigate the soil of any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, these producers now produce a
mustard seed, they press for oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: run their tractors off of, and when the
mustard is grown on the land, it
[SPEAKER_01]: organically, all naturally bio fumigates
the soil and prevents all that disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're able to either use the meal or
grow the cover crop and then immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: terminated and plant strawberries and get
very good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started thinking, you know,
a big part, one of our issues that I wish
[SPEAKER_01]: I could solve, because I'd be a
millionaire is fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I can't go out there and say,
hey, use this and it's going to kill your
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats, because, you know,
I both know nature is very fickle when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to guarantees on killing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that I've been able to use it,
God, it made a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our build-a-flower would have fungus
gnats in it from the only non-fish compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and from worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hated that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just never want someone to be
like, finally, I'm going to go organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get a nap and they're like,
fuck this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't have this in my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and a lot of us are like,
well, it's kind of the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, people that work out,
you're like, well, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: sore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't talk about it that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, living soil, it's, well,
there's going to be some gnats sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we started mixing that into the
line, what happens is when it hits the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, there's an enzymatic reaction that
releases this mirenaise enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for a limited period of time,
for like five minutes or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might have a lingering effect,
but that's how long it takes to build up
[SPEAKER_01]: these enzymes and release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what releases that wasabi-like
odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That basically kills all the larva,
at least from my observations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been white paper studies on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is that these compounds are
phytotoxic and they can hurt and stump the
[SPEAKER_01]: growth of your plant, but not once it's
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've experienced the best results
mixing into the build-a-blom, or I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, the build-a-flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's no gnats that come out of the
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't guarantee that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature is unbelievable, but like 99.99%
less to the point where I'm so grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: that I found this material.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I mix it into our soil, it pillows
with white growth, because what I see
[SPEAKER_01]: happen is it like biofumigates the soil,
and then all that's left is the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost like once the forest fire
burns, everything teams with life,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil just pops off in white,
Santa's beard growth, and just more than
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever seen, almost more than the
kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like because it fumigates and
cleans the soil, all the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferates afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we mix it, we see less fungus
issues, we see an abundance of life,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a great seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a trifecta for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've made very little inference about
how to use it on actively growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an earth box where I sprinkled it in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took out every gnat, white feeder roots
growing through their healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had other plants where I top dress a
little, maybe heavy, in a water,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it burns the edges, and they feel like
they're stunted for a slight bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be that just a little bit of
stunting is not the end of the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I pride myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, I think a lot of our customers
love having those perfect leaves and
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing that organic produce that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they start to get burned,
they're like, why am I doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Hydro's for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am hesitant to make recommendations
on how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made water extracts from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried top dressing different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the challenges is, let's say
you go in a grow room and you have two
[SPEAKER_01]: beds of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get every gnat, meaning you
can spread the mustard seed meal out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, and it'll kill the larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's one freaking gnat left,
that enzyme is now gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil's teeming with life, and the gnat
won't come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll have the beginning of the
process of life start again and then
[SPEAKER_01]: multiply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good that it doesn't make it
inhospitable for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a short term period, but it makes
it so that it's not an end all be all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mixing it in for us has been a game
changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to try to track down
some myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the tail end of things, just got a
few viewer submitted questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one I wanted to ask you was,
have you ever considered offering your
[SPEAKER_00]: services or establishing any sort of
presence in the European market?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other people that have come
and done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shipping across the United States is
hard enough, let alone across the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe from a consulting standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I tend to focus all of my energy on my
own business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard enough as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making a profit in this industry is very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I feel like we're just on top of
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other times I feel like we're never
going to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like every entrepreneur
probably feels like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But expanding that overseas when I haven't
mastered, like I haven't solved the
[SPEAKER_01]: riddle, so to speak, here, it feels a
little foolhardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of what goes on in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I also don't want to ship
stuff from over here over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd feel like it'd be better to help
someone find something locally that worked
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certain products like the Q and Aloe
and Coconut and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's already shipped around halfway the
world by the time it gets here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be fun to share some of those lighter
weight products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've definitely considered expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, Mexico are really high on our
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be going into that
market this year as far as working with
[SPEAKER_01]: the labeling tariff codes and what you can
import, what you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just have been going through growth
challenges as a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to focus effort on what's
more important than trying to focus tens
[SPEAKER_01]: of hours away from other problems we could
be solving on going international.
[SPEAKER_01]: But God, it would be a dream to have some
products all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen our product show up everywhere
in the world by somebody that flies here
[SPEAKER_01]: and mails it to their buddy or whatever,
but nothing as far as an actual e-commerce
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think expanding internationally is a big
step for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really good question with we got from
one of our listeners was, how often did
[SPEAKER_00]: you top feed the autopot system before the
roots were able to reach the bottom and
[SPEAKER_00]: just access the sub?
[SPEAKER_01]: So top watering, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they recommended me to do is to
wait, I have to go look, but I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: they said 10 to 14 days in that size
container to establish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, they're going to err
on the side of caution because they really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make sure, because they know what
I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sub irrigate too early,
your plant's going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could rot it out completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the only system I've ever had
where you kill a plant, not the autopot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a sub irrigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I thought, man, these earth boxes are
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's good, bigger is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found these round, black,
tall, sub irrigated containers with like
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 gallons of soil that would fit in 30
gallons or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I filled it up, put a plant in bottom
water and killed the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is funky down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got anaerobic, but as long as the root
system was in there digging and it would
[SPEAKER_01]: go drive and eventually it worked,
but it never would go dry when it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: much soil and so little plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe what I did is I followed,
I have to look back at the video because I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember discussing it, but I waited about
10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me in the earth box, once I saw a
few branches growing, I know from what I
[SPEAKER_01]: know, studying roots, the first thing
plant roots do is they go wham to the
[SPEAKER_01]: edges and down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like grow in the middle for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: They immediately search out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, if you release a whole bunch of
cattle out of a truck in a new field,
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing they do is walk the entire
fence line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they understand that they go hang
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like roots are similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, bam, search their checking
account, their savings account,
[SPEAKER_01]: see where the water, the foods at,
they get established, set up their home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that typically, in my opinion,
if the environment's right, it takes less
[SPEAKER_01]: than 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I erred on the side of caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I went closer to their 14 day
recommendation, but I didn't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: issues after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel like early on, it felt slightly
wet down there and I was worried about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I ended up adding the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I didn't do like a
side-by-side, I don't know if it made the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference that I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to have, but that answers the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 10, 12 days that I top
watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, I turned the system
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting question here that I had
noticed myself on the side is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there any notable differences between
the Q extract 1.0 versus 2.0?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the Q20 and Q60, and that is
based on a number of the minimum guarantee
[SPEAKER_01]: of the saponin percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both higher than that,
but we want to guarantee a minimum level
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 60 has been impossible for us to
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of what went into our
desire to make the 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was also because we wanted to be
transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never told people the Q60 was 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have just kind of changed the
ingredients without saying anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we wanted to be very transparent
and there are some differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 60, when they make like an animal
vaccine, they're after these saponins and
[SPEAKER_01]: very pure compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of why we can't buy it is they
can sell it to the highest and best use to
[SPEAKER_01]: these medical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they forecast like two years ahead of
time with the production level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that taps out the plant's capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, every day we've
got work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would they care about us?
[SPEAKER_01]: And our company's trying to involve us and
get us more material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's part of why we haven't seen as
much Q60.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do to get the 60 is they take
the natural extract from the bark from the
[SPEAKER_01]: tree and they just make like an awkward,
like they boil it, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get basically the natural
saponin level, which is closer to 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what they do is they pump it through
like a vacuum filter and that gets it up
[SPEAKER_01]: to 60% or even higher in some instances,
a lot higher, 75%, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is a little bit more pure
saponin, but build as well has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: more about the natural, like the natural
pressed neem oil we talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed meal is not doing these
extractions, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even like smoking flour rather than full
dabs, but that's just preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to the Q20, that is as
natural as it gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right off of the finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about the natural 20% that it comes
in at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little slightly higher on good
bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you get is some sugars and
some polyphenols.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's probably better for
the soil, but it leaves, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky around the edges of the bag because
it's got the sugars in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it pours and mixes slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some feedback that it doesn't
mix quite as well as the Q60, which makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's built down to just the saponin
practically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually prefer the Q20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if someone was trying to make like
a pesticide spray or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're really trying to go hard on
the level, maybe the Q60 would make a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them both, but for the cost,
I feel like the Q20 is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our final technical question for this one,
and I think it's a good one submitted by
[SPEAKER_00]: one of our listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, I'd love to know Jeremy's views
on the lift the pot watering method and
[SPEAKER_00]: checking the weight versus just the 10 to
15% volume method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the lifting is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 10 to 15% is kind of like a shoot from
the hip way to tell you, Hey, don't go
[SPEAKER_01]: more than 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you for sure overwatering?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get runoff everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going way below,
you better do it more often, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do like a percent or
two, you should be doing it more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was just a way to share with
people who've never done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Hey, it's 10 gallons, a hundred
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what does this plant need?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could take a 10 gallon pot and
say, well, Jeremy says do it at most one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be a fast growing plant needs
a little more, but one's enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can always give it more the
next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you, from the beginning,
feel the moisture, when you're building up
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot, plant it, you can get a good
weight, calibrate that in your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're ever wondering,
because over and under watering can appear
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat similar, you can grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's bone, if it's light,
you go, Oh, well, now I know the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's super heavy, you know the
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lifting it is huge, but in a hundred
gallon pot, you're like kicking it,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to lift the edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not really sure what you're doing
because you can't lift it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been using these EcoWit moisture
meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feeds to my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the percentage and over me doing
it for a while, I'm able to share the
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage that I see on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people could try and match
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows them on a big pot to not
have to know like how heavy is yours
[SPEAKER_01]: versus mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm big on things that allow
communication from a distance over a
[SPEAKER_01]: subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at home, I mean, lifting it works
really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final one, before we wrap up today,
a bit more lighthearted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two-parter.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, surfboarding or snowing,
if you could only pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondly, how's your wife doing
after her surgery?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people are, you know,
sending good vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right away she's doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recover's heart, it's a long process,
learning to basically walk again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they cut, it's like a hip
replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an osteotomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they do is they like cut your
bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rotate it to change the angle of how
it interfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they cut a piece off and they allow
your hip to encapsulate it and put it all
[SPEAKER_01]: back together with bolts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been hard, really hard,
but I'm always impressed by her tenacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's back up at three o'clock in the
morning these days, going to the gym
[SPEAKER_01]: again, doing physical therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She crushes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, sorry, I just keyed in on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the other question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Surfboarding or snowboarding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, surfboarding or snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say surfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only because I see these old guys out
there, 85 years old, something still
[SPEAKER_01]: paddling out and catching good waves on
long boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I love the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to end up there one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while snowboarding has a special place
in my heart, I definitely feel a drive up
[SPEAKER_01]: into the mountains in a snowstorm for a
long session is a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't just do it right before work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can surfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So surfing has a special place in my
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it goes without saying
we're sending all the healing and positive
[SPEAKER_00]: vibes to your wife, though it sounds like
she's just a monster and doesn't need
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any general comments or shout
outs you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I want to wrap it up partially
because, you know, we've gone a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could be here for hours longer
with you, but I feel the pull of work from
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the office door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make sure I get back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, I just want to encourage
people to not sacrifice in life for one
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have living soil, which means you
can have good quality and you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: good yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of times people are
considering these things like what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: trade on trade, trade off for going to
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it was more of a decision
about lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been proven to be so many ways
to get this to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll fit really every model, every
methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, you're tinkering with the
latest tech, smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing bigger containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, the man behind Build A
Soil, the organic wizard himself.
