[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you go with anyone else,
guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Going with seeds here now means that they
promise you'll be happy at the end of a
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, drop them a line, they'll sort you
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only stock quality breeders,
including the likes of Heavy Days
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, go pick some up
maybe, eh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Likewise, a huge shout out to our friends
at Pulse Sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have everything you need to
keep your garden dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: From temperature, humidity, VPD,
PPFD, all the parameters you can't track
[SPEAKER_02]: with a simple thermometer are holding your
garden back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a Pulse Sensor will allow you to
take your crop to the next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: More resin, more flavor, more yield,
whether you've got a single tent,

[SPEAKER_02]: Now coming with special release sachets so
that you don't have to spread a medium
[SPEAKER_02]: over your garden, and instead you just let
the predators crawl out from the sacks
[SPEAKER_02]: that you hang on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Truly another game changer from the world
leaders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, guys, you don't want to have to
go up against a spider mite infest station
[SPEAKER_02]: without having adequate predators on hand.

[SPEAKER_02]: so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, Gang, we're back for another

[SPEAKER_02]: grateful to be joined by the man behind
Coastal Seeds, the land race lover,
[SPEAKER_02]: the equatorial enthusiast and old school
Santa Cruz head, Kegyu of Coastal Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've been asking me to come on for
two or three years, so, sorry for the
[SPEAKER_00]: delay, but we're all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I am stoked to have you on,
and I know that a lot of our fans have
[SPEAKER_02]: been very eager to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to start off by asking,
what have you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've been smoking some Irene
Colombian that I bred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, turned out extremely nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very strong, very greasy and oily buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Irene cut from Radio Ridge two
years, I think two years, three years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't familiar with Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking, I had requested a
couple things to work with that I normally
[SPEAKER_00]: don't work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would be some of the cuts that are going
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Irene was included in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out to be extremely,
extremely nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also been smoking some Zee Wat Naho Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with Zee Wat Naho?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was gonna, I had a question
about that for you, because we had a fan
[SPEAKER_02]: who was very interested, and for anyone
who's seen the Shawshank Redemption,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they're familiar with the terms
Zee Wat Naho.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you give us a bit of background on
that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems really exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a friend of mine was in Mexico in
the early 80s and acquired it down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just recently got it seeds two years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up crossing it with a 72 tie
stick that I got from Jim James,
[SPEAKER_00]: who recently passed away from Alaska
cannabis cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know him or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did an interview with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you did?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, it was actually probably,
you know, just about a month before he
[SPEAKER_02]: passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was, you know, obviously very sad to
hear of his passing, but it was sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: good timing that we were able to record
some of his thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to go back and find out where
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to listen to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll send you a link.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on his way down here to chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd been talking for, I don't know,
six months or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're both old timers and we had a lot
of things in common from the early 60s and
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of he kind of opened up and I
opened up to him and some certain old
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was I was very lucky to be able to
connect with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's never really met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, we talked a lot on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a really nice, really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was definitely my takeaway from our
discussions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a really generous, nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you've sort of got this line
that's, in a sense, in his honor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when you crossed it to his
seventy two tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were the effects and the smells of
the end result of those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one nail tie has a real juicy fruit,
strong juicy fruit flavor smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't know if it's I'm
not sure where it came from, because I had
[SPEAKER_00]: never grown that particular one before,
or the seventy two tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one way or another, it's in there from
one of the one of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very strong uplifting,
long lasting, it's one of the one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best old landrace Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's another one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Zacatecas, that's another one that
I've been working with also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, so that's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to probably grow that out again
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see how it turns out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to jump into some Mexican
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we go there, I just want to
quickly ask, I know you've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with a range of different tie
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you say this seventy two tie
stick from Jaime compared to some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: others you're familiar with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I only grew it last year,
but I mean, it wasn't as airy as I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically seeded everything,
so I really didn't get a chance to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke it unseeded, but it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exotic from what I can remember from the
old tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not real good at explaining the
flavors and stuff, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: On traditional tie, I grew some lemon tie
before from another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fellow that lives over in Thailand,
and it was very.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very extremely long flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tie stick that I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like it matured quicker,
narrow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to smoke it again and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see what I think, because I really
didn't get a chance to smoke it without
[SPEAKER_00]: having a seed in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll all have to keep our eyes on that
and see how the project unfolds for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to touch on some of the Mexican
stuff because you're the only person where
[SPEAKER_02]: I've I've had two different breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I distinctly remember both Bodhi and Mr.
Bob Hemphill saying that totally
[SPEAKER_02]: unrelated, you know, at different points
in time, they both said to me that they
[SPEAKER_02]: think your knowledge of Mexican cultivars
is second to none and that you've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of experience with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's quite an accolade from the two
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd love to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Snow has much more knowledgeable on
the Mexicans than I am, but it's nice of
[SPEAKER_00]: them to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look, I think everyone, you know,
sort of acknowledges John's wisdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, on that same line of
thought, I would love to ask, can you tell
[SPEAKER_02]: us a little bit about some of your
favourite Mexicans?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously there's a lot and I
don't expect you to touch on everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just maybe some of your favourite
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we share a lot of those and we a few
years back, we both grew quite a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say off the top, my favourite
Mexican would be the Nayarit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Zacatecas, of course, Zihuatnejo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiapas, I grew years ago, but I had a
problem with it and his was the same
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics as that Snow High and I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seemed to do better with his.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might have had a little too
much, too rich a soil for that because it
[SPEAKER_00]: had a little bit of intersex issues,
which it shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was, I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was probably that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a kind of a weird year that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant might have been a little
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that those are well, I mean,
well, Hawken I like also, but those are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably my favourites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mishvacan, that was another good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't grown any of that in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that those would be my
favourites so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, what a diverse range of plants there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a number of listeners have just
heard that and thought, I haven't heard of
[SPEAKER_02]: half of those strains before.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe the Mexican
varieties for people in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that for most cannabis
growers, you tend to hear a lot about Thai
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties and Southeast Asian varieties,
but you don't hear as much about Mexicans
[SPEAKER_02]: these days, but they are having a bit of a
growing resurgence.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe the general effects
and flavours of Mexicans if people were
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably you don't hear about them
as much as they're getting more difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to find pure lines down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi was down in Mexico a couple,
two or three years ago, and he only could
[SPEAKER_00]: find I think three pure Hawken lines,
whereas the year or two before that he
[SPEAKER_00]: found like I think six or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting harder and harder to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of the old timers down
there or maybe grandkids or sons of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the old growers down there have
preserved some of the old landrace and got
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up with cartel growing bullshit
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably more than likely have to
go to these obscure places to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would be quite as easy
for somebody to go down there and really
[SPEAKER_00]: find the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not impossible, but I think it would
be difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it helps to know somebody and have a
connection down there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the effects, a lot of them are
up high, happy, giggly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are way more expansive, good
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get quite large like a lot of
plants, large colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really had too much many
problems with intersex issues with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexicans that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think all landrace strains have some
that do have those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said earlier, a lot of it can
be caused from stress on the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: rich soil
[SPEAKER_00]: light depping will force the plants to
flower and a lot of them don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're well aware of when they need to
flower to to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a real special connection with the
plants on a spiritual basis, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really not quite the term I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're they're a they're a little
entity in themselves and they they like
[SPEAKER_00]: you bring something like say from Mexico
or say Thailand, that's a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: range of temperatures over there and bring
the seeds over here and grow them they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna gonna go till some of them February
I grew some last year that I got and just
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow them out and they were growing
till February and then finally finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't worked with them since I
didn't have that many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, so the plants have an inner
clock and when they are ready to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and when they are declaring sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you sometimes people force them
just back to this light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that some of the landrace don't
really care for that now you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex issues, not saying all of them,
but some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that that certainly makes sense
that they've, you know, evolved over
[SPEAKER_02]: these, you know, hundreds of maybe even
thousands of years to to sort of recognize
[SPEAKER_02]: where they are and be in certain
environmental parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned a few times that,
you know, these lines can be more
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive to the environments that they
grow in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any tips on how to grow any of
these old world strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think a lot of the advice you
hear online is that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorials, for example, they really want
a more mild nutrient profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to hear what's your style?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you just use soil and let it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you like watering teas and
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: On my landrace, I found that they don't
really require much fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use a mild, maybe one or two
times of a bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't normally use any nitrogen,
very, very small amount across,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would maybe use a little bit,
but I haven't been the last quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really use much fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been a heavy fertilizer person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they I even had a really weak
soil mixture one year and I can't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: what strain I was growing, but it burned
the leaves like I had given it a big blast
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it and went, Wow, I couldn't
believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watered it through and then just
didn't feed it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it snapped out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just really burned it heavily
didn't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're growing with really a lot
of the soil is poor, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: rocky, you know, different soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've evolved to extract what they
need out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, they'll tell you what
they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in tune with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're into that more mild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that all makes sense, as you said,
because, you know, historically they
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't grown in, you know, like modern
cannabis medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to quickly jump back to the Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a while ago, I heard Mean Gene
talking about the strain Dolores and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know that you've got some experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you tell us a little bit about the
backstory of what you know and how it
[SPEAKER_02]: grows, how it flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dolores is an old strain from the 50s
and Beatniks brought it in to Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real, it's a rare one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew three plants last year,
and just to grow it out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of which were very nice,
tighter buds and one was a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had like a, what is that,
like a spearmint smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: To two of them, whereas the other one
didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ryan, Radio Ridge had come by and he
was looking at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had never really smelled that smell
before it was an unusual one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there, I want to work with that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do a seed increase because I
don't have a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I grew some about eight years ago,
I got from a friend of mine that he got in
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Sur from a family up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And theirs was crossed with something
because it was just a very indica
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I could get at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I found out the gene had somebody
wanted to get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was real nice of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it was related.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought maybe it was coincidental.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd heard him talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool to hear he passed it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when I spoke to him,
he said that he had heard a story that it
[SPEAKER_02]: might be like half of the Big Sur Holy
Weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you got any thoughts on that at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know you've got some experience
with Big Sur Holy Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many stories on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did ever meet the guy that bred
the Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like all the stories about all
these different obscure strains and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of stories come up, but you have to really
get your homework and you still might not
[SPEAKER_00]: find out the real story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the story I got was the Big Sur was
Zacatecas and an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any, like, what can you
tell us about the Big Sur Holy Weed in
[SPEAKER_02]: general, or at least the one you've worked
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different expressions of the
purple, you know, and then there's a more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a green, you know, and the purple one's
quite a bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not overly powerful, but I mean,
it's, you know, not any of this crazy THC
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage like these guys are doing
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know, I think it was like 22
or something, but plenty though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't remember, I don't think I ever
really tested it for the different
[SPEAKER_00]: terrapins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have in an old test from the SC
labs or something, I'd have to look back
[SPEAKER_00]: and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, I haven't been doing much
testing these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just can't, you know, I grow maybe
I'll grow 10 different strains or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't really go, I can't really go
and test 10 different strains for terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could, I guess, but I really don't
want to spend the money on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it's for a particular
documentation or for something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I'm going to do a lot few this
next this year here on a couple of them
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have to I have to look for a lab to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so they're, they're uplifting
pretty good lengths of a couple hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: three hours, sometimes they can get pretty
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got good branching, nice,
nice structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good size, good size flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in a while, you have to stake the
branches up because they can get taken
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not always, but Wow,
that's cool to hear like, as in like,
[SPEAKER_02]: the stems are thin, or like, they've just
got so much weight on them, they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not then they just break at
the base, they get so heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds get so heavy, and the branches
are huge, the Christmas tree symmetry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they get out there and some of them
wrap, break some of them and I just tie
[SPEAKER_00]: them up if I can get them by the same day,
or early the next day, and pull them to
[SPEAKER_00]: where the break goes back up into the main
stem, they'll heal, you got to pull them
[SPEAKER_00]: up quite a bit to make them see them and
they'll regrow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had really good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it plant doctor at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if they're damaged too bad last on
there, and I hadn't noticed it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really wilting real bad,
I'll just cut it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they make it and sometimes don't
if it's just too far gone like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I normally don't miss that I can
bounce numerous times every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and just to take us back for a second,
you mentioned that you'd heard the Dolores
[SPEAKER_02]: was brought in by the beatniks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had heard that you you've been living in
sort of the Santa Cruz area during the
[SPEAKER_02]: golden years of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to know, did you have any
experiences or stories with like any of
[SPEAKER_02]: like the bowl crew or like any of the
lines they brought in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just in general, what was it like
living on the coast back then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any memorable stories?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of memorable stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of Brotherhood hash coming
in oil, hash oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually found a couple of seeds seeds
in a hash patty from the Brotherhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I lived in Bonny Doon and I grew
those out and they were they were so
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what kind of where the
hash came from Kabool or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never I never did find out but that ash
was I never I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just too strong for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No wonder they make cash and 10 the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a real big hash smoker either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I've got asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really I don't really enjoy
getting all hacked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: coughing all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and it there was some lot of
good tie came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, like I said, the hash oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey oil was from those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that that was the time the the 60s
in the early actually late 60s,
[SPEAKER_00]: early 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when the the Nairi came in
one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they brought that in or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and then Zacatecas also and of course
there was well Hawken and Acapulco gold
[SPEAKER_00]: then too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a heyday and a lot of a lot
of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a few of the lower level Brotherhood
guys, you know, and passing having a drink
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown with some other friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't I wasn't really
involved with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, what amazing experiences you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as like a follow up, do you remember
when they first started bringing the
[SPEAKER_02]: Indicas in and did it change the game
immediately or was it more of a slow
[SPEAKER_02]: progression away from the Sativas as the
Indicas rolled in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know when they brought in
those, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have brought them over to Hawaii
to grow because I know that I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: tie was too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what their seasons are
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they have three or four seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a guy that I'm going to probably
ask talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was involved with them kind of up there
with them off to ask him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just recently got to talk with him
and I sent him some of my Swazi Burmese
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, he wanted to smoke some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he would like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Sativa guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's something I'll ask him
and maybe I could find out for a later
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion or pass that on to you at some
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we step away on to talking
about some Colombian stuff, which I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: really excited to do, I just wanted to
quickly ask you, I'm not sure if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: aware, but there's this strain in the
community called Super Freak and it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: this mutant type of plant and a few
breeders are sort of doing their own thing
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that plant originally comes from a
pack of coastal seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from the Banana Roe G Cross Big Sur
Holyweed that Bam did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to ask you, does it feel
like, were you aware of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, does it feel cool
knowing that like your company and the
[SPEAKER_02]: people a part of it help produce something
that's not just like a memorable strain
[SPEAKER_02]: that lives on in clone form, but like
something that's actually gone on to pave
[SPEAKER_02]: its own sort of breeding progression and
breeding projects in and of itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you aware of that and how does that
feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not aware of that, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a friend of Bam's was doing,
I believe, the Banana Roe G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, no, I wasn't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in touch with that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't talked with Bam in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, when we talk, I haven't talked
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to find out a little more about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like it's a super unique plant
in terms of the morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a fern from a jungle and not
like a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sort of akin to if you've seen
the Australian Bastard cannabis photos
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years, where it's just like a
plant that doesn't look anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, but it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's obviously there's a lot of
breeders out there trying to make hybrids
[SPEAKER_02]: that are that like smoke really nice,
but have this very incognito sort of look
[SPEAKER_02]: where, you know, you can hide it in plain
sight, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought like that's that's like a
really cool thing, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders, you know, let's say 50 years
from now, like we may not have anything
[SPEAKER_02]: around that from our work we've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I suspect that super freak will still
be around because it's truly unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just thought that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanted to mention it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I kind of remember there was a large
population when Bam took me out there to
[SPEAKER_00]: see all that go growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to remember there might have
been some kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutated things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time ago, and I wasn't
paying much attention to that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: strain myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew that it was a it was a good
breeding and it was it had potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they were growing a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they really ended up
with with that project or if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: still working with it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost contact with a guy that was growing
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want to delve into some Colombian
stuff because you have done a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we go there, I want to quickly
ask you, because I'm sure a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: are wondering, what is it about the old
school strains that keep you coming back
[SPEAKER_02]: and you keep working with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the case that they have something
more to offer than what the new school
[SPEAKER_02]: has?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it the case that the new school is
missing something that you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a little bit of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old school stuff doesn't have the real
high THC like a lot of the new flavors of
[SPEAKER_00]: the month have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the terpene profile are very
unique in the old land race lines or even
[SPEAKER_00]: the heirloom lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that they're in time,
they're going to find a lot of cures
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from pure land race lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, I'll be able to see some of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking into different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of put it on the wayside,
but I'm looking into different terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: right now that I'd like to breed for and
encompass that are cancer fighters,
[SPEAKER_00]: they fight tumors and that's something
that I hope to finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or finish my research anyway, in another
year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the places where the land race is,
most of them, they all want our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people like me, I want their
stuff, because it's not polluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can work with those pure lines and
they're really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you've never grown them before,
you got to read that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plan is it acts different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they don't really require
much except I have a filter out back and
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes care of the chlorine and the
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eliminate that and that's the water that
I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got plants with it and they seem
to tolerate it, but it kills off a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the good bacteria and stuff, so I don't
use regular water on my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I cover that all right or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so they're a bit more sensitive to
sort of those more minute factors that
[SPEAKER_02]: come into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to follow up, you know,
you mentioned these cancer fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, and I think a lot of people would
be interested in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that it comes down to the
cannabinoid profile, the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: or is it just sort of a holistic mixture
of all of the above?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100 percent sure, but I would
think that it would be a combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe all of it over the hundreds
of years or longer, thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like a lot of the hash
strains, they just bred them for making
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and whatever the requirements they
were looking for, they bred for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done any research on old hash
breeding, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of things that they've
acquired in their gene pool that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: normally not going to find in some of the
newer strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that the new strains may
not have it, but most are probably won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be overthinking that, but that's
just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, that's a sentiment we've heard
expressed by other guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think you're going too much out
on a limb saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to quickly divert for a second,
because on a personal level, I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask you this, like you were referencing
how it's getting harder to find the pure
[SPEAKER_02]: stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it that you go about finding new
stock or leads on new stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if, for example, someone messages
you and says, hey, you know, I've got some
[SPEAKER_02]: tie or some Colombian from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that you have to approach that
with sort of an element of suspicion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you find that most of the time it
pans out to be pretty reliable?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't approach it with suspicion,
but I do talk to them and ask questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I have anyone that I can
reference in regards to them to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been approached quite a number of
times and from Thailand, a new friend in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico now, I met a couple years ago from
Snow High.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up here and we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: He met him and his wife and had a nice
chat.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I've got one friend in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I get my Swazi from.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just recently sent me some F5s of the
Swazi that he's been working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old line from Swazi line from Afro
Pips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing that Swazi for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight years, at least the F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anxious to try the F5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put a little dusting on it
with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the first year I've.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't I don't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of winging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'm really doing as far
as in life for my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's just I've got some
things started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some more that I'm going to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about it a little later,
but I got to I can give you a list on what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so I'm at small things that I
haven't grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred them and haven't grown them like
the Nairi Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred that three, four years ago,
along with the Zacatecas Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had isolated some purple pinos and some
green pinos and crossed them with my
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian red that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my best Colombian that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep you keep teasing us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to the Colombian,
but I'm worried we're going to go down a
[SPEAKER_02]: rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to bang out some of these
peripheral questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you because you just
referenced Thailand in the prior question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, obviously in the past sort
of six to 12 months, they've they've
[SPEAKER_02]: opened the floodgates of legalized
civilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from my point of view, it seems a bit,
you know, I hope people don't mind me
[SPEAKER_02]: saying it seems very much like it's the
Wild West over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've spoken to some Aussies who have
gone over there to try to do things and
[SPEAKER_02]: they very much describe it as the Wild
West.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on
if you have any feelings on the way things
[SPEAKER_02]: are rolling out in Thailand and if you
suspect it may be better or worse for the
[SPEAKER_02]: overall preservation of Thai varieties,
because from what I can see, seems like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're growing a lot of, you know,
American cookies style stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think that will play out long
term for the Thai varietals?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going crazy over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good couple of good sources over
there for pure lines and they go away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the big touristy places and they've met a
lot of the locals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live over there and they met a lot of
the locals that are still underground and
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep those pure lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, my friend told me the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all cookie, cookie boys over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of new strains over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went into some of the dispensaries,
I don't know about all of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of them, there's no land race in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just OG or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever they wanted to have somebody send
them over or bring them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think within, I don't know,
it's already getting polluted over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of time before it's
going to be just difficult to get pure
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get with some people that
are preservationists like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not an easy job being a
preservationist, a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to grow those for your years
on end, and eight, nine months or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some less and then make your seed and
then you have a fresh batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so some of that that I grew this
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was real surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't airy at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fairly nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still letting them cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to follow them for another
month or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I noticed that that needed to get
a good cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm looking to I need to do a seed
increase on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think it's going to be more
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going crazy over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a wild west.
[SPEAKER_00]: My couple friends have gone over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they went over and acquired some
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's when you open things up,
it just you never know what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I saw I think it was today.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I saw that it the greenhouse
seeds official Thai coffee shop has opened
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, it looks like Arien and
the crew are probably going to help speed
[SPEAKER_02]: up that transition by introducing super
silver haze hybrids to the Thai market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, onto something a bit more
promising, which is that a lot of fans
[SPEAKER_02]: messaged me and wanted me to ask you about
the hibiscus Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had really grabbed a lot of people's
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think using that purple Koronto or
however you pronounce it, I'm good at
[SPEAKER_02]: mispronouncing names.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems as if that's really grabbed a lot
of people's attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can people expect from the hibiscus
Thai?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any specific traits they should be on the
lookout for or any purposes you might
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the hibiscus in itself is a
beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a purple Koronto female crossed with
a puna butter male Hawaiian heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was grown and it is still being
grown up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: By Kiona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're familiar with them
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent John seeds of that years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, talk about bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pictures posted from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have some on my my Instagram
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I mean, it's a it's a it's a it's a
gorgeous flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got that really nice Colombian
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor as the Thai cross I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think how many did I did one,
two, three, four plants last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, my initial thought was I
didn't particularly like the breeding the
[SPEAKER_00]: way the structure was.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, not the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the structure was fine was the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed a little airy to me,
but they smelled good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smelled like the original hibiscus
that the that Hawaiian Colombian and but
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's being grown out of that radio
ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw some selections out there that
are very promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've changed my mind now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to I didn't really wasn't
sure if I was going to release that or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've changed my mind that we're
looking for some selections of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's got some good
possibilities and I was expecting a bud
[SPEAKER_00]: formation like what I saw when they grew
it up in Seattle at Kiona.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't it was way more airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you need a larger
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm limited on what I can do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I live in town, so I can't grow a
whole thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the most I can grow, I could I
could do a grow out of 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that'd be about it for me,
maybe 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm pushing it and I'd have to keep
them pinched down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so I need to grow that out
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll buy that's something I probably
should grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might as well just get it over with and
grow it out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they're doing selections out there
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: To hear and you mentioned in a prior
question and sort of touched on it like
[SPEAKER_02]: tangentially in this one about,
you know, making seeds and having to do
[SPEAKER_02]: seed increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first question is, how often do you do
seed increases on old lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a certain time frame where you
think, oh, we've reached that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better do a seed increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to start to fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more individualized to each line
than just a specific time frame?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I've got some I mean,
I've got some that are gone beyond what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they need to have a seed increase,
but I only can do so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know every seven years,
maybe, maybe sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stored properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have the hibiscus is I haven't
done a seed increase and that was bred in
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be mistaken, but I think that's
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're, you know, they're getting
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still got a good germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I germed a bunch a couple years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got like 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're still they need to be that's
the best strain that I need to do a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: increase because it's such a beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a I'm really happy the way
that strain came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lovely, lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like as a follow up, do you have any
tips or recommendations for people trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to crack old lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not any 100% thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I just heard a friend of mine
was just telling me that he does see she
[SPEAKER_00]: gets an aloe vera leaf and slits it in on
the end there and opens it up and puts the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds inside and leaves them overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then either puts them right in the
soil or in a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said extremely good luck before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done that I've tried aloe
before and I've tried to help and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: tried soaking beans and dumping the beans
out and using the yellow water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little result on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that was from a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic seeds in Oregon told me he had had
good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then then again, there's embryo
rescue, which I'm not adapt to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't approached any lab because I
haven't vetted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wouldn't want to just have
any lab do a embryo rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to feel I don't want to sound
like I'm weird about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, genetics are rare and you
know, you got to do your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all I'll say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but it's on some of them and
they're really rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find a place that does embryo
rescue or Maristem work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all holding out for the sort
of artificial embryo tech to become more
[SPEAKER_02]: mainstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's definitely some truth
to what you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, after everything that happened
with phylose, I think it's only reasonable
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a sort of an element of you know,
as you said, maybe not suspicion,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you got to, you know, keep in mind
that bad things have happened in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely probably one of the most fan
submitted questions we got when I let our
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon supporters know this interview was
coming up was that people wanted to know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you go about selecting males with
the old world and equatorial lions you
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to work with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any specific tips?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you select one male?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use a mixture of males and do like
a pollen mix?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you go about doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've done, I've used one male and I've
used multiple males before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the Colombian crosses that I
did, I had four males, there were two
[SPEAKER_00]: conical males with branches kind of
upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were two males with the
traditional Christmas tree branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they both had a good stem rub,
they smelled good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had selected those out of about 15
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like the tie, I had one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, I did an open pollination,
I just let it rip in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got so many seeds off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to do some, some very
select hand pollinations this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from now on, I think I'm just going to
be doing limited releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've got access to seed on some
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to do some bulk sales at
some point, but I haven't figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: where to go about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, hand pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use one or I've never used more than
four males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I did that with four
males, that particular Colombian that I
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke of earlier, is extremely productive,
and it's, it's an extremely strong
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a big, large amount of germplasm
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting different four males was likely
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at the time, sometimes when I
select them, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for branching, I look for stem rub
bigger, they don't necessarily have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: big, good structure, you know,
just all around healthy, plant that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky enough to get trichomes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to ask you, how do you do
your open pollinations?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Tom Hill on the show not too long
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says that he doesn't cull anything
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, you know, even if there's like a
male that's like a head of the pack,
[SPEAKER_02]: he'll just, he'll just like top it,
just take the head off it, cull all those
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just try to keep it so that everything
still sort of begins dropping pollen at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He won't even cull any of their runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was really cool because
I never really heard people discuss how
[SPEAKER_02]: they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe your open
pollinations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it similar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there some degree of selection?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a, that's a real interesting
question because out of runs have come,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the strain runs, but runty plants are
odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants can turn out really unique in
different, different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally don't keep the males of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could see where Tom would do that
just to keep that, that genetics full
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of taken out because you never
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that that runt could have
something in there, a real special terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or something in there that's extremely
unique and evasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe, maybe it's not something
you can normally find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know with plants or these weeds,
a funny plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've looked at some plants and I
had to look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numerous times I'm going I'm trying to
figure out what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even as long as I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a congolese years ago,
I had the weirdest plant, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took forever to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't read it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just was nondescript.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, got off track there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, yeah, I don't normally breed
with runty males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't see anything wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's worthwhile doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, how do you approach making
your crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something that's conceptual,
where you sort of sit down and you think
[SPEAKER_02]: about one plant, you think, oh,
this is really going to pair well with
[SPEAKER_02]: this other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more based on feel and intuition
and you just sort of let things happen and
[SPEAKER_02]: then whatever starts striking your
interest afterwards, you pursue that
[SPEAKER_02]: further?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, I have it sort of planned out on
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier this year,
I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what I'm going to be
pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I've had a plan before
and then found some males that I like and
[SPEAKER_00]: and cut the tops off and brought them in
the house and collected the pollen on a on
[SPEAKER_00]: a dinner plate and then let it dry for
three days and put it in the freezer and
[SPEAKER_00]: then keep that pollen for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I decide to use it, I would still
keep it in there until I'm ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, it's just kind of some can
pop up out there and you just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: change your mind or modify your your
thoughts on how you're going to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year is going to be way different
because I'm going to do I'm going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and do quite a number of hand
pollinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to be be out there with a dead
calm day, I'll tell you, because I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: lift those big pots somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are smaller summer tents,
I got a couple of tents, but I've not I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not an indoor guy and I need somebody to
help me set those things up to to where I
[SPEAKER_00]: could start maybe doing some pollinations
inside or some seed increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just never got into the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its points, but I love growing
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I was trying to do an indoor,
I'd be a hack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be any good at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings up a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that it's possible to run
some of the land race stock you work with
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors or do you think it would just
simply be like two uphill of a battle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, you could do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd probably you just have to watch it
and maybe not try and rush it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did think which land race I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did I don't think I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I did do I did a that I got from
some elderly couple in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were fine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I don't remember how long it took.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a while wasn't 24 weeks or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just let him go and then made my
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's that's one that I
they're getting older, they I need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: those again, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to see my seed collection,
you'd probably shit yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at it sometimes and I go,
Oh, my God, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't pass up a good trade or if I'm
looking for something and I haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find it and it comes up,
I'm going to try and get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so yeah, and we could probably talk
about this a little later on the choir
[SPEAKER_00]: electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk about that now or a little
later, however you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, jump into it now and tell me about
the choir electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I got two different choir electrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one from a friend of mine who
actually bred it and he had crossed it
[SPEAKER_00]: with Afghan number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my original choir electric that I
worked with with the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: My same Colombian, gorgeous plant,
big buds, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my latest choir electric I got
from Jaime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to talking and I had asked him
today, you don't run across the choir
[SPEAKER_00]: electric, do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me and I told him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you know, I know where the
gate is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an electrician over in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he knew all about it and knew
right where the place was, where my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: had had his grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got the choir electric that
does not have the Afghan number one in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I have to do a seed increase because
I got a small pack, but I did do some
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the tie with that this year,
the tie stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be that's going to be
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's those are really good size
buds, very greasy, similar greasy,
[SPEAKER_00]: oily looking like Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't normally get flowers like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my you know, I mean,
some of the newer strains may have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't normally pull with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so yeah, to the the two choir
electrics are both equally as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the one's got the Afghani
number one and the other one's just a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all kinds of stories about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one I got was from my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: who I've known for close to 3540 years,
he sent his friend over to Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_00]: another surfer in Afghanistan,
and he brought back seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the original choir electric
that my friend had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't get a chance to talk to Jaime
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he grew that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then then my friend got a bunch of
these Afghan number ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were even at the time,
they were kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed the Afghan number one with a
choir electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's what that one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one, I didn't get to
really ask him about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so distraught about him dying like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, we just, it's just like,
you know, besides that, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: two old guys get to talk about their
times, smuggling and selling, slinging
[SPEAKER_00]: bags and strange you had in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have I don't I got a handful of
people I talked to about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not around anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, they're gone or or years
ago, I wouldn't imagine myself talking on
[SPEAKER_00]: here talking about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You come out of your shell a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a real underground private game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it must be a big surprise to see
the way the landscape of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community has changed over the current
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's going to continue to
evolve and become more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: mainstream?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think to a certain extent,
there's still going to be like a small
[SPEAKER_02]: group of really hardcore, passionate
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the majority of people are just
sort of more in that casual category?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think more and more people are
becoming aware of the the land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you have to be set up to,
you know, grow that especially outdoors if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, I think, most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I shouldn't say most a lot of the
younger growers want faster maturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics, you know, because they're into
it for a different reason than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never had a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just it's not something that,
you know, I don't know, 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that one of the Emerald
Cups nine years ago, it wasn't many people
[SPEAKER_00]: doing land race and come up to talk to me
at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as time went on, there's younger
guys coming up and asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's getting out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote a couple articles years ago,
and one from high time done by the high
[SPEAKER_00]: times proponent, but they asked me to
write something I had a friend that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: whether photographers, and I wrote a land
race article in there, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if it goes Burmese and
Swazi, I think was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and then a couple things with skunk
Julie, let's skunk magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm hoping it'll become
more and more people working with land
[SPEAKER_00]: race.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably work with land race
crosses, because that's going to speed
[SPEAKER_00]: them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of hard to say, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys out there that all are
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're driven for that, you know,
and they want to do as many crops as they
[SPEAKER_00]: can quicker, I want eight weeks,
this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's people that are not
growing for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're looking at it in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for terpenes are looking
for maybe, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you don't really normally get on
hybrids or the newer versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to find out after I'm long
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, hopefully you're still with us for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned it a question or two ago
that you had some experience with the the
[SPEAKER_02]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that there is that Santa Cruz
Red Congo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That one specifically, have you had any
chances to grow it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was that the one you were referencing
in the earlier question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it just a general Congo seed line
you had?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's that's another guy I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Red Congo is a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't really know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's not what I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually the congos that I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which I got from somebody at the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no name or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember who the guy was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been sitting back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I germinate him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a good germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had him for six years, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure it's purple, green,
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what Congo but I figured I'd
grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I I make a little paper and write
it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of those times at the booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real hectic doing a booth at the Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know that the one or two times I
swung by the booth when you were there,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was it was all hands on deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you foresee yourself doing any of those
again in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel like since the legalization
that the the vibe at the Emerald Cup has
[SPEAKER_02]: changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't foresee myself doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to have help and you got to be
licensed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had I think I don't know what Bodie
thinks about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he was keen about it last
time or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's if it would have progressed the
same way, I probably would have kept on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'd have my my get my same friend to
help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gave him the money as an old high
school friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a high school friend, but a friend
I've known for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and then I could need hand
me the seeds and give it to the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been a couple of times I was just
doing it by myself and it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that one last year, I think Bodie had
a line clear out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he'd never do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, man, you you had the following
going clear out the door, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember that year in question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we both had a real good year on sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what he did, but I did pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the year when you had the puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think what year the last
year that was the last year they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup before they changed over
whatever year that was four years ago or
[SPEAKER_00]: something three years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty seventeen, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that year was, that was the last
time I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a couple of people went to
following year or two and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, well, you're kind of
limited, I don't know if you I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd maybe go there to look around,
maybe see what people are offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd probably do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I wanted to ask you because you
mentioned, you know, talking about seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: in your collection a question or two ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love to ask all breeders,
especially those with like the really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: old world strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the seeds in your stash that
you're most excited to pop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a follow up, what are some of the
seeds in your stash where they're really
[SPEAKER_02]: rare and that, you know, they're probably
so old they won't germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like if the technology was available,
you would love to get to those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I've got some really old Colombians
that that I tried two or three years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: to germinate a couple of different times
and didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some lambsbred from Europe that
may germinate, but it's from two different
[SPEAKER_00]: groups over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think some Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I should have had my list of all
my land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like a big list of all my land
rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not really prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly have some Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew some Lebanese a few years back and
I was thinking of maybe doing that again
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Lebanese blondes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blonde had hermy issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red turned out pretty nice actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd have to, I honestly don't,
I couldn't even name 20 of the rare ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to go in there and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some old Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably some Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some old Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all very jealous even of
those ones you can remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some beautiful stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a quick follow up, how do you store
your seeds long term?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some in and some out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I'm using now I don't keep in
there, but I guess the best way if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing long term is vacuum seal them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some rice maybe or something or,
and then put them in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my buddy had some, he had some 50
year old seeds that were frozen and he
[SPEAKER_00]: germinated them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked with him a couple of weeks
ago and I went, wow, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, can't say I've ever heard of
anyone being able to get 50 year old seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's really, really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an OG like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows something that I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to pick his brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a little bit about it, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned Bodhi in the last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you, cause we had one or
two Patreon submitters ask the same
[SPEAKER_02]: question, which was, what was your
experience with the American skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: selection?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it about it that you decided to
work with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what sort of smells and effects do you
get?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real unique one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd think it's going to be a big skunky
thing, but it's, it's really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's got kind of a weird gross
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve, Steve would be the one to,
to tell you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some that has hardly any THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some with moderate to semi good
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: High CBD, low CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi likes the lower CB, the lower THC
CBD, high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a couple that he picked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was, I had talked to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked him, hey, you want to do a collab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that American skunk came up and I
said, yeah, I'd like to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a real good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be hunting some stuff on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be grown out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, a lot of good stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think I, I'm getting ready
to probably grow some of those out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Radio Ridge also, and do a large
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've mentioned Radio Ridge a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you plan that in the future,
people might be able to get some of your
[SPEAKER_02]: selections in cutting form from them,
or is it more just like a collaboration
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to help test some things on a
decent population level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what I'm working on,
on some clones now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which regards for is the San
Fernando Valley OG across with Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, they like it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had don't quote me on the numbers,
but there was like 50, 50 cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're down to like, three or four now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't select them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I saw them after they were
selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first read that, I wanted to try
something that was made more mainstream to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross with my land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ryan had originally brought that
out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when he brought out the
Irene also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was another one,
a motor breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, that that was a good reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had been Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, yes, there's me doing,
I'm going to be doing some more
[SPEAKER_00]: germination out there in June or so,
I think, and start making selections and
[SPEAKER_00]: then, you know, if we find anything really
super, we'll start selling some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a couple that we're
probably going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hibiscus tie, I'm really going to be
pursuing that one out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Irene Colombian, SFV Colombian,
Swazi Burmese Colombian, we grew that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turned out really nice out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a few off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone needs to keep their eyes and ears
open so they can go get some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: verified, you know, authentic Keeper
phenotype stuff from the good folks at
[SPEAKER_02]: Radio Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're using that name
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're using Hayes Valley
Nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure Hayes Valley Nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd put them up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be, everybody knows them
by Radio Ridge though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, keep your eyes out,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get it nonetheless, because it's some
killer stuff direct that's Kagyu approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we move on, you just
referenced, you know, Bodhi enjoying the
[SPEAKER_02]: lower THC, higher CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a surprising number of people
message me wanting to ask you about the
[SPEAKER_02]: Coastal Seeds release of your Panama Red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And specifically, you know, because it
does have that CBD, CBEG sort of genotypes
[SPEAKER_02]: within it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little more about this
line?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: What people can expect from it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And any tips for selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired that from originally from Snow
High and as a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got seeds after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Hemphill did the selection on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's forgiving plant doesn't really
require much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got, I don't have any lab reports
or anything, but it's got pretty high CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and some CBG in there too, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've released a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's an old line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I'd like to one day grow up some
other that's pure out of that that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: selected and work was out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of curiosity, did you ever try any
memorable Panama from when you were a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: younger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this sort of the first one you've
had experience with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just briefly, there wasn't much
I got a little bit from a friend in 71.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 70 71.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was memorable Colombian,
you know, like type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's Panama red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was I mean, like the good Colombian in
those days, like the Colombian red I liked
[SPEAKER_00]: in those days better than gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more of a brown brownish gold,
golden weed versus the gold, pure gold,
[SPEAKER_00]: brown green, real sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy had these, I call them wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were rolled up, you know,
like hay bales they do in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were it was in a tourist or it was a
roll like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had like, I don't know,
three pounds three or four pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Oh, let me look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Oh, no, I got the gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, No, I'm not interested in the
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants the gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me look at the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was looking at it and sticky smoked
it, man, forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was comparable to the Panama red and in
a way but it's so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really remember it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was so many Mexicans coming
through and then those like the ones I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned earlier, they were really top
notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as remembering that,
I honestly don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that's a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I would have had a choice of
the two, I'd take my my Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still remember the Colombian red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just about to get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we do, I want to quickly ask
you, take me back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: My first experience was right when I got
out of the Navy in 1967, July 67,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, a buddy of mine and I were going
to this bar in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, Hey, I got a joint you want
to try?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Oh, man, I've been wanting to
try some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was afraid to in the Navy because there
was rats in there and it's afraid of
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody ratting me out going to the brig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't I didn't pull with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my pipe smoke some Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the Colombian red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I smoked I don't know,
four or five hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the first time I got stoned and
we went in there and had some beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That started it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, myself and many others
out there can only wish that their first
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with cannabis was with a
mythical Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that light the flame inside of you to
pursue it further?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it further down the line that you
were like, you know what, this cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, it's really speaking to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to do this more.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I liked it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't start breeding until the first
time I started breeding was when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: invited by doing and then there was a long
time frame in there where I didn't because
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I had a another job in Woodland,
a regular job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a break from it for quite a
number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when I was at Bonnie Doon,
I remember what year that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He were three, I think that I found up
seeds in the hash and then I had some I
[SPEAKER_00]: got some Pakistani seed, it's a Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to think what else no tie at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the first time my ruin
bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I didn't for a long time because
I went elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to put it on hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, was that first cross a
success?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it intentional?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was a sort of preservation only?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a bit of a rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1969 is when I first grew 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to see what I could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of curious, didn't know what I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd never grown it before,
you know, so kind of and I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: really anybody to really talk to about it
because you didn't in those days kept your
[SPEAKER_00]: your business to yourself if you were
smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I did some reading and that was
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my out of a couple of books because
I really didn't have anybody to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: about it in those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say as you referenced,
there wasn't a ton of people openly doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it at that stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any people you looked up to at
that time or was it just really the one or
[SPEAKER_02]: two people who wrote the books?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't really look up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, you know, being into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember what books they
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some older books, just,
you know, basics to where you could tell
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I mean, I met one of the RL that
used to grow the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, he heard about me up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of I didn't really leave there
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hauling water and 55 gallon drums to
definite gorilla farming in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I didn't really didn't really
talk to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandable, understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what was the first name
strain that came around?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, obviously, you know, you had the
land races and they called their
[SPEAKER_02]: respective origins.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people say, oh,
you know, train wreck was the first name
[SPEAKER_02]: strain I ever grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any sort of experiences like
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, name strains now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what I'm working with,
I mean, quite electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, SFB, I worked with that that one
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one that I want to pursue
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I don't know if you've heard about
this or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ant of Baruch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard of that strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was going to ask from the old Dirk
Cora Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirk Cora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a bit about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is that it's a it's a rare
Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me any more details?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's all I know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a rare Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I looked it up on line one day and
I don't know what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found Dirk Cora.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for something over there in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Bluehemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the strain you were looking for called
Bluehemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another famous one from Dirk Cora.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, we don't like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read it and thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I remember right, I couldn't
get him to ship over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy of mine send it over from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at the time, they didn't send
seeds over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had I got a couple packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me a little bit of actually it
reminds me quite a bit of Bodhi's American
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk, the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's I never really thought about
it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there's something in there
that's common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to talk with Bodhi about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looks similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real good size tight buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns, you know, purple in the winter
for all the people that like the purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not I don't breathe for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, but it's it's a it's a
gorgeous, gorgeous plant and then cross
[SPEAKER_00]: with the commune, I need to grow that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it out when we were working with
another nursery when we were licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only time I saw it and it
turned out beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got to be grown again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but it's it's got a lot of beautiful
aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting, because I
noticed it's it's one of the few sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: indica lines you work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we're on that topic,
you know, I wanted to ask you a bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: about one, your thoughts on the various
Northern Lights lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a follow up, can you tell us a
little bit about the NL-1 line that you
[SPEAKER_02]: and Mr. Bob have used over the years?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it comes from classic seeds
originally, but could you give us any more
[SPEAKER_02]: info on how you got it and what sort of
traits it is has?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it from classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it from a source.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I'm not sure who the person
was, but it was around a similar year or
[SPEAKER_00]: so time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he got the Romulan from Romulan Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd got a classic got a hold of me
and said, Hey, I'm running low on these
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Light ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do a seed increase?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I I made some in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like, I think I've got four or
five females, different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I haven't worked with them all
that work with it all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob has.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing that so many things
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ironic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I should have worked with it,
but I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went on to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, I'm going to work too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any memories of like NL-1?
[SPEAKER_02]: NL-5, NL-2 or any of the other NL lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did they never really leave much of a
lasting impact on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I've never grown them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be getting a NL-5 cut from a
friend of mine and up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's supposed to be real special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes the NL-5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if you did like a huge hunt,
the NL-1s got some good things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we will be
pursuing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, gorgeous stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a final one for the Indica
questions for the moment, can you tell us
[SPEAKER_02]: anything about the Red Leb that comes via
way of BAM?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, you know, Coastal did a
release with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know much about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I know and I think I'm
right on this is it came from Howard
[SPEAKER_00]: Marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds came from his collection and
were given to friends and it sort of made
[SPEAKER_02]: its way to us via BAM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you heard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I heard that it came indirectly from
Howard Marks.
[SPEAKER_02]: What more provenance could you ask for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, an old hash smuggler.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how good does that get?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's about time we moved on to the
strain everyone's been asking us to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about, the Colombians.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from my perspective, I think
Colombians have really become more popular
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past recent years, especially with
the community having an active discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: around how big of a part Colombians played
in the original inception of Hayes and
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe some of the real special
effects Hayes is known for actually come
[SPEAKER_02]: via the Colombians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we delve into some of your work
with the Colombians, I'd love to ask,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think that some of the magic that
we see in the original Hayes comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Colombians?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Punta Roja, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know 100%, but I never talked
to the guy that bread does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, but I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think later on, maybe they cross him
with some things, but I that's all I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I have heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm sure other people have heard
many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's I don't know which what is the
truth and what's the story?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you ever had like a decent
discussion with the guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're saying you've met one of
the Hayes brothers, is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that you know, there's this thing
about the Hayes brothers, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's basically there were three guys
from New York that came out here and
[SPEAKER_00]: bought the Hayes and they called them the
Hayes brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story I have the guys that grew
it down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they were brothers or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew one guy that was close to the
people that grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we never talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked a little the Hayes and then he
smoked one of those joints that I made the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash that came out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the only experience I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a little bit and then I never
saw him again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm still trying to find this one
guy to get to the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's around, but he's he's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a I'm a driven guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get the original Hayes seeds that
are fairly fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to germinate those there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some that are original ones that
are older, or 3040 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's another batch, small amount
that are, you know, under 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be able to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I mean, you know,
there's stuff from there's other Hayes out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but I don't I don't know if any of
those are the real ones or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure there's somebody's got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why don't you tell us for people out
there, including myself, who have never
[SPEAKER_02]: been lucky enough to try pure Colombian
that was verified?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe it in terms of the
flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colombian red is really expansive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real earthy taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a soaring high.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else could I say about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Borderline see some sparkles, maybe some
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a it's probably one of the best
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, good Colombian is there's a lot of
them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this I was lucky enough to get
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's others that I'd like to
acquire, but maybe they'll come.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's that's about all I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's just a real great sativa
strain for the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to make you fall asleep or any
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would you describe some of the
traits that your Colombian red now
[SPEAKER_02]: imparts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm sure we're going to discuss a
few of them specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, what sort of aspects does
it bring to hybrids it's used in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Colombian carried over into the
SFV a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some that's more so there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it in the buds, but the buds
are not airy by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Colombian is not an airy Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a little denser than the Swazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the new Swazi, I don't know the F5
that I'm growing up and my it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a little denser than the F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the communists barely dance for a
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It carries over on a lot of the crosses,
the SFV, some of the selections from the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous grow that I did had the structure
of the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was dense, a little dense,
whereas the SFV buds would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, chunkier and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it carries over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's pretty dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do some more this year,
probably two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be I can't get enough
working with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think at some point, maybe I'll
release a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I actually I actually traded Amy some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he we traded some really rare
stuff that he doesn't normally let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I can either talk about now or later,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please fill us in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one called Golden Voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever heard of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, fill me in rare, very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a tie grown on one of the little
islands off of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this new connection that I made that
I've been talking to knew exactly where it
[SPEAKER_00]: came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was doing things over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It some say it could be Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Lao.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he says no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am growing this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people probably wonder why did you
grow that earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to wait later to see if I could
maybe get it to even throw some early
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering a little bit just to pollinate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it gets fully I want the
seeds to be fully matured, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: care if the the flowers fully mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just preserve it and grow that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposedly extremely strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one other friend that has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaime ever let any of that go to anybody
else, but they were extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did a trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and I I was I would have bought it if
I if he said no, I want this word,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been looking for it for 30
years, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear about it all those years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, it came through here briefly in
the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one time when the tie loads were
coming in, the untied the tie sticks,
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddhist sticks, the hand pressed,
light pressed blocks of tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden voice came in and it was a
super special tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought at the time they said it was
it's tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this guy even sent his
brother over there when he was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: think it was in the service or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, make sure you go to this island and
get that golden voice, get those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to find out a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to write up I'm going to do
maybe a little write up on that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and maybe post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so it's like the Dolores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wish I would be able to talk to
the people that brought it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, they're probably gone by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look into that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, people want to know when
they get to the point where they're so old
[SPEAKER_00]: and then people die or they get old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they forget like, you know,
I'm forgetting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you forget stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the story is kind of obscure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so you don't know,
I heard this and I heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you can you got to I mean,
it's nice to pin it down if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, while we're on the topic of sort
of Southeast Asian varieties, one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners wanted to ask if you could give
us a bit of a back story on your Burmese
[SPEAKER_02]: lines that went into making the smugglers
choice Burmese.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Burmese I got, I actually got that
from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't really using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out to be a great breeding
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got terpenes off the chart,
just different flavors and and and
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it originally came from
Reeferman.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I if I remember properly, I'd have to
ask Bodhi again, I think it was one of his
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a it's a beautiful plant to
breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get big, huge colas, big bulky
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like I crossed that smugglers
choice with it, which was I also got the
[SPEAKER_00]: smugglers choice from last six seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was on sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess classy got them and he found out
later he thought they were tie sticks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were from Burma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's you know, it came up with that
name smugglers choice, which is a great,
[SPEAKER_00]: great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I was I could just crank those
things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a magnificent name, I think anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannot deny it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannot deny that.
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of smells and effects do you get
out of the Burmese?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some bubble gum off of before,
which I would like to find again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has she kind of has she?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a a real you didn't know
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be it's you know, the buds are
are larger colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real fairly dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves start off wide and then they narrow
out as the plant but yours like like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the swazi is skinny right off the
bat, the leaves are real narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's so unique about all these
different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's a you know, that's another
one that I'd like to put out there more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if people I never hear back
from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if they like it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's nice if you have people
that can grow it out and actually give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a smoke report and a grow grow report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are something else that we're
going to grow out at Hayes Valley nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make up to Hayes Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right on right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, how about I jump to what you
requested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of our patreons has said,
I grew some of the American skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: selection cross Colombian last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the turps were really sort of like a
sweet gas and citrus mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been my favorite so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all my buddies have agreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you experienced that yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they the normal sorts of flavors you
get out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I grew, they had some gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that I kind of liked out
of it, because everybody, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the people, they like the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that's a killer collab,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's really got a lot of
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's going to be, you know,
if you're wanting like a one to one or
[SPEAKER_00]: like no, you probably I know there's going
to be I think there was one in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically had THC low enough to where it
could be hamper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a killer strain to work with
some hemp, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to hear that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, while we're on the topic of gas
quickly, I wanted to ask, was it a
[SPEAKER_02]: conscious choice on your part to breed the
Colombian with these gas heavy strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I noticed you had the headband,
you had the SFV, you had the motor breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that the Colombian just pairs
well with these sort of chemi gassy
[SPEAKER_02]: strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was that just sort of coincidental?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I basically I don't know if it was a
coincidence or not, but I wanted to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some breeding with some of the newer
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, the headband is not as
new as some of these runs and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff they got out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I wanted to do a breeding to offer
that to more of a mainstream clientele,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you could call them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than just straight land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was surprised that the
gas came through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my main thing on the SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could get it, if it could be a kind
of a tight Colombian bud with the gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the SFV, boy, that'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some so that worked out the
motor breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had a couple plants because I
didn't have any room to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gorgeous, huge buds, beautiful
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those need to be looked into more,
too, because motor breath supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty strong, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if people still want that or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do, I'll pursue it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I'd go on to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure was real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: My SFV plant and the headband were smaller
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have used a fire OG guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he likes the fire more than the SFV,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Coast is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look I'd heard that the fire was
probably the most potent, but I think a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people like the flavor of the SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think what I had heard was didn't
really produce all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that the I don't know if it's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are normally that small or
what, but I don't have any experience
[SPEAKER_00]: growing any OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time I grew those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I smoked that, I was with
Bam when we were going up to the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup and I just got completely ripped on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I got stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too stoned to be driving really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say I had the vice grip on the
steering wheel and I'm just concentrating
[SPEAKER_00]: on driving and focusing on the road and
Bam sitting next to me laughing and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: go, what the fuck are you laughing at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, you are so ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so yeah, I thought, well,
that's the one I mentioned to to Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross that headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombians that actually turned out really
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those you know the back under that
we can skip back into the doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hibiscus tie the Irene Colombian.
SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antiparook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run all those to see if we
can find some nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know I some a lot of people don't
want to pull with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean some like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love pulling with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not real keen on taking cuts nowadays
from elsewhere because of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virus that's going around that's
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, do you have it over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that because as far as I know
there aren't really any American cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: that have made their way to Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've been able to exclude it,
but you do hear reports about apparently
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds can carry the virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean gosh, it might just be a ticking
time bomb honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know, I mean I I from what I'm
read it's a small percent, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's a bad one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a lot of bad viruses out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I have to imagine it might just
get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean I I don't want to get
into any conspiracy theories or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's all this shit come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I worked up alpha seed
research in Woodland.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tobacco mosaic was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the Alpapa plants are real susceptible
to that, so you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody that smoked cigarettes could go in
my greenhouse where I was doing my
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then you know a lot of
people smoked out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that were doing the vegetable
seed, a lot of the the hard wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: the red wheat, triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys, some of those guys smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you smoke and you touch your plants
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a plant that's susceptible,
it's contaminated while you're.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're it's like there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had heard that and I and I
wouldn't and I wouldn't be surprised that
[SPEAKER_00]: people that smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affecting the weed too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I'd heard of tobacco mosaic
spreading from touching and in more
[SPEAKER_02]: importantly from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ashing a cigarette into I'd heard a story
about a guy who would walk around his
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse and would just, you know,
ash the cigarette into the pot thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you know, it's just it's whatever,
but I've heard it can pass through that
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll all have to keep our eyes on the
lookout.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a few last questions before we
get into the final ones and one thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to quickly ask you was you seem to
have hit a real successful formula
[SPEAKER_02]: combining New World genetics with Old
World genetics, like the ones we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, you know, some of the OGs
with the Colombians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this formula will continue
on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we expect to see some cool
continuations of the Old World meets New
[SPEAKER_02]: World?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't mind working with some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newer genetics and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, and then the ones that I have
now I'm going to probably keep working
[SPEAKER_00]: with those and doing selections with
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it seemed like they they did
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the few that I worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is, I mean, like the hibiscus
type, I wasn't real keen on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the smell on the structure was
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds were a little airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I mentioned earlier,
I was a little, I don't know if I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to release this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do wouldn't really have a real
good bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw some of my gear out at Hays
Valley and I went, wow, these look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to go out there and look for
them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to quickly ask you the Swazi.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one where, you know, you mentioned
it earlier, but we don't hear too much
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to know, is it similar to the
Durban at all or is it like totally
[SPEAKER_02]: different?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different than the Durban that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Durban land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds are, they're more of on a,
you know, they're a bigger bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like a Burmese bud or
anything, but they're, they're bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than, let's see, what would I compare it
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of what I compare it to
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not a real spindly,
skinny little sativa bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fairly nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not super dense, but they're
larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they're a Swazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm anxious to try that and see how they
do this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look a little different DF5s to the
F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still like the F2s and I'm probably
still going to work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so yeah, the Durban would be a
little denser flower than the Swazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Swazi is a real uplifting,
wiry daytime smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have a couple heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't do a whole joint anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'm not a heavy smoker,
but the times that I do try stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I, you know, I mean,
I'm trying to think, Snow High gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: some, a cut here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that last couple of years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a talk about smoking too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Acapulco gold cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that shit was like caffeine,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too wiry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was real wiry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not that life like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had told me he said,
Yeah, I can get like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if somebody inexperienced smokes
that you're going to get the heart rate
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to go up to hell,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a pleasant experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, you know, some of that
stuff, you have to do moderation on it
[SPEAKER_00]: like anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is incredible sounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to give that a go myself
on a similar, you know, racy uplifting
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that you had bred with the Cali
Mist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us a little bit of info about
what the female that you bred with was
[SPEAKER_02]: like in terms of smells and effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one that I'm going to be
germinating this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent that off to Hawaii to get evaluated
years ago after I first read it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get any response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of put it on hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get a good report.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was good, bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's been a while and I haven't,
you know, I had a chance to blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, you know, it just wasn't what I was
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to evaluate it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a I mean, it was such an iconic
strain that Cali Mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did hold some packs back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I'd like to get
more feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even if someone grows some of my
genetics and well, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't particularly like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what didn't you like about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all good with I like constructive
criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me makes me think on, you know,
what I need to do to improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I'm going to be growing that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a pretty good list going here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was about to say we keep adding to it,
don't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the last questions before we do our
quick final five questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: To wrap things up, what are some of your
favorite lines you offer?
[SPEAKER_02]: And more specifically, if there was a
listener out there who thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give coastal seeds a go,
but I don't really know what to pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are one or two lines you feel you
could recommend to just about anyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to have a good
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Kona Gold tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiroelectric tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irene Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Zee Wat Naho tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Sur Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have quite a few, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smuggler's Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kwaii Electric Outcome, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few that I'd recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that is a really diverse and cool
mixture of strains, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might need to do our final five
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question as we wrap things
up, what is the single most memorable
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with cannabis you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't necessarily need to be like
the strongest weed you've ever smoked,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just like something where it really
left the lasting memorable impact on you
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tie sticks, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's still right in the in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Vietnamese that I got that was looked
like shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he brought me I went over to his house
and I he says, Oh, I got the Vietnamese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Oh, let me look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, he had a gallon baggie there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: This man, I mean, he's really,
they took all the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're kidding me.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, he destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not I need to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I opened it up and smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, the pungent smell was
that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to Thai, any of the Asian ones
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the problem is it was just
that was 1960.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that eight or nine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that was memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as far as the high was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really remember that pathetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't remember the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very memorable, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: The the Nairit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Texas was real memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, some of the walk and was memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, actually, I grew one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a mazar Sharif one year and it
finished in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was real memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally can't grow that because it
molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a perfect year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got some more seeds of that from my
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd sure like to be able to finish one
of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's probably those are probably
the memorable ones, I guess, off the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going to say when you said,
you know, you forget the the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone's going to,
you know, hold you to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have likely forgotten more cannabis
strains than we've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that given the the vast
longitude of your relationship with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, no one's going to hold you to
blame there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other end of the spectrum,
I would love to ask you, what is a strain
[SPEAKER_02]: that you were really excited to try?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe your friends had hyped it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you finally tried it,
you were like, oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really didn't want to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was given these and they're all
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to probably get hacked on this
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people get what's wrong with that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never I didn't really like the runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never thought they ever didn't do much for
me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheetah piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: A neighbor of mine bred that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some that I wanted to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me got me on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good answer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it means you've always been pretty
happy with what you tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on to our next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone had to start a company with one
single pack of seeds from coastal,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you think would be a good starting
point?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's something that's got a lot to offer
from a breeding perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, you're giving me some toughies,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably off the top, my Colombian
probably would be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my Colombian red, maybe to start a
seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's a that's kind of a that
would be a problem for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can start a seed company was
kind of a multifaceted question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could start a seed company with land
race based, or you can start a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company with your flavors of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess it kind of depends on what
you're looking for in your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do what the masses want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to start a company that's
different and unique that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could, like I did on a couple of
mine, you could do a combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of depends on which way you want to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been asked that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's a real good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to think about that later
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad we could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: On to our final question for the
interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rock up to your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a time machine with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell you, you can go anywhere throughout
all of time, anywhere around the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: presumably to collect either a clone or
some seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: What period of time and where are you
going to go and what do you hope to
[SPEAKER_02]: collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: A few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some some of that early Afghanis
where the hash the hash came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Brotherhood stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I need to I mean, I don't even
really know where those came from if they
[SPEAKER_00]: were coming from getting anything from
Mazar Sharif or where Helmand province or
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think probably more unlikely
that wherever the hippie trail was going,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where they went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever that was some tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a really, really, really rare
Indonesian strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I don't know how to say that there's
a real rare strain over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a real strain over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you don't even want to mention
marijuana over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's it's hard to get that would
be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, you know, I'm glad I'm
Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there's a there's a many
places, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main main ones probably would be
probably Thai, Colombian, Afghani,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some incredible building blocks there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt you're going to have some success
going forward with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of this chat today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any general comments or shout
outs you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we could chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterwards, after we get done recording a
little bit, I got a couple of questions
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can talk after that,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't really have any questions,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, perfect.
