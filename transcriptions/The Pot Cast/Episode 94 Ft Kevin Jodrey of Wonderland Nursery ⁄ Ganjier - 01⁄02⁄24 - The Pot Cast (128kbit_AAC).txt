[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_00]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, you're joined here by your boy,
Heavy Days, here from the Upside Down
[SPEAKER_00]: Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as usual, we want to give a massive
shout out to our incredible sponsors who
[SPEAKER_00]: help make the show happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I know you love seats here now,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking it up yet another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a whole bunch of amazing
celebrations and promos coming up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: month of February.
[SPEAKER_00]: Celebrating Groundhog Day, Valentine's
Day, Presidential Day, and to kick it all
[SPEAKER_00]: off, for the whole month of February,
they're celebrating pineapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, a range of different
pineapple flavoured strains across the
[SPEAKER_00]: site, 20% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to get in on the fun at seats here
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the hottest breeders, the latest
drops, shout out seats here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate your support so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get your garden producing the
best crop to date, you've got to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: your room's dialled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that, check out our friends at Pulse
Sensors, number one sensors and integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: hubs in the game, measuring all of the
variables, PPD, VPD, temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, dew point, all the extra
variables you don't consciously track to
[SPEAKER_00]: help ensure your next crop is the best to
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're running a single tent,
a single room, or a multi-state operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulse Sensors are the number one in the
game, and they've just recently released
[SPEAKER_00]: the Pulse Hub, a central unit to integrate
all of their monitors to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: your rooms are the best they can possibly
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive thank you to Pulse Sensors,
we appreciate you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, you've got to keep your garden
pests and pathogens free, and to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to check out our friends at
Copit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are the world leaders in
sustainable biocontrol solutions for pests
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're battling spider mites,
check out their new Spidex Vital Plus
[SPEAKER_00]: sachets.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are new persimilus breeding sachets
that release predator mites into your crop
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently over a period of several
weeks, providing you with sustained spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mite control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't have to spread carry-on
material through your garden just to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce predator mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hang the sachets on your crop,
let the persimilus walk out and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me guys, you don't want to have to
go up against a spider mite infestation
[SPEAKER_00]: without Spidex Vital Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are truly the best predators in the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise once you use it, you'll see the
quality you'll never go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive shout out to Copit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, you've got to check out our
friends at Organics Alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing organic and want to use
high quality powdered organic fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you simply cannot go past Organics Alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys truly walk the walk and talk
the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been picking up cups left,
right and centre with growers all around
[SPEAKER_00]: the country sweeping categories using
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the ultimate testament in my
opinion if home growers are winning
[SPEAKER_00]: competitions using their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof is in the pudding guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what stage of the plant cycle
you're at, veg, transition, flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: in need of micronutrients or a very
specific sort of boost in late flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to check out Organics Alive
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly one of the best in the industry.

have on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, check them out Organics Alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive shout out for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, a massive shout out to the entire
crew at DynaVap.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys make some of the best
vaporizers on the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really passionate about this one
because they help me to get off combustion
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoking bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any concerns about your
respiratory health or heck, if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to try a different mode of ingestion,
maybe try to get a better flavour hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to check out the DynaVap.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys units are cheap, they're
incredibly well designed and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, they're very customizable.

level getting insane turps all while
[SPEAKER_00]: retaining the potency you'd expect of a
combustion or a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly, I was smoking bongs for over 10
years, I'm now vape only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive shout out to DynaVap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're one of the best in the industry
and we owe them a massive thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out again DynaVap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive thanks for supporting the show.

[SPEAKER_00]: The owner of Wonderland Nursery,
career hustler, well known face in the
[SPEAKER_00]: NorCal area, creator of Ganjie Air and
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: A massive welcome to Kevin Jodri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here today for an epic two-parter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk all things breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: His recent trip to Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty gang, we're back for another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on today, I want to give a big welcome
to one of the most well-known faces in
[SPEAKER_00]: NorCal in the Mendocino area.
[SPEAKER_00]: A local legend, the man behind Wonderland
Nursery, a career hustler and a true
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big thank you to Kevin Jodri for coming
on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really, I'm really stoked to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are stoked to have you on, a much
requested guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we've been asking
guests recently, what have you been
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking on lately?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm smoking on right now is
it's a, it's called like a, what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gazzo 41.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from Gandia's farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Gabe Ruth seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a London pound cake to an SFV
sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they took an SFV sour as the male,
laid it into a London pound cake cut and
[SPEAKER_02]: it produced a really beautiful gassy
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I, what I like is it did really
well outside and the shape of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: itself just landed itself to outdoor
cultivation, incredibly well, just
[SPEAKER_02]: everything exposed, almost no leafing
required.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little color came in at the end,
but just really good, clean, nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: crisp fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been smoking, I've been smoking
the shit out of that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sounds gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, shout out to Gabe,
I follow his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you mentioned in the mix there,
the SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask you, you know,
you've probably seen more OGs than just
[SPEAKER_00]: about anyone passed through, you know,
the nursery over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which OG is your favorite if you had to
just pick one or two?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it depends on what I was doing
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I wanted what I think was the best
effect of an OG, where it just caught me
[SPEAKER_02]: the best way, it would be that Topanga
Canyon OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also call it the Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, the quality of the effect was
just stellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, for me, that's the one that
resonated with me as a smoker best,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as a cultivator, probably the Larry
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Larry cut it, it's what the market
really wants as an OG and its production
[SPEAKER_02]: potential is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes in earlier outside and it's
just really a an excellent plant for
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial Kush cultivation and the
quality to fly was epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Hollywood Topanga for smoke,
Larry for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, um, the Topanga or the Hollywood,
you know, it's one that I feel like it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really get as much of a mention as
some of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, to me, it's got that gorgeous
marshmallow sort of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't see it too much elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd be interested to know,
why do you think it hasn't got quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: much traction as some of the other more
commonly referenced ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really short supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the end of the day, almost every
OG is really a self ghost cut Josh D cut
[SPEAKER_02]: original OG, you know, whatever we want to
define the name as, but all these
[SPEAKER_02]: variations come out and that Topanga cut
was just very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the people that had it
realized that the value of it and they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they held it in house a lot tighter than a
lot of the other cuts were the Louie to
[SPEAKER_02]: 13th is another rare one as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was held really close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you don't see the Louie to 13th cut
in any big circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the other OGs are floating around
every way you can get your hands on a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty quick, but the Topanga and the
Louie, both of those were, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: guarded so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got ahold of him and I shared
him into the system just so the jeans
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't be lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's farmers that still run both of
those, you know, in our area and out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the area, which is the main point of
genetic preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get the plants into multiple
people's hands so that at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, it's still alive somewhere in
colonial form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I sometimes I stay awake at night
and think to myself, how many chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent plants have we lost over the
years just through not taking cuttings or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a seed dying off before it could
fully show its potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, definitely emphasizes the
importance of keeping all the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: backups you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a little brains at when you
mentioned, you know, how certain cuts are
[SPEAKER_00]: held tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently on the show, we've been chatting
to people like Yo Sammy and even Shanty
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been talking about the C5 and
the A5 a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, I was cruising your
Instagram last night and I saw you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: post about the C5 many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess you're very familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about your thoughts
on the C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a bit of a haze resurgence.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what I liked about the C5 was that
it, it just had a really euphoric happy
[SPEAKER_02]: buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you consumed it, you kind of lost
track of time, but in a giddy way,
[SPEAKER_02]: you were just very lighthearted and life
just seemed to slow down and brighten.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it did have a really unique effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was fortunate that I got,
I got cuts of it shipped out from the crew
[SPEAKER_02]: out of England.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got access to the real plant to play
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got to experience it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like it actually more than I like
the A5.
[SPEAKER_02]: The A5 is a little more aggressive and
it's fun too, just in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something about that C5 gave me a
really good euphoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm digging that there's a resurgence
on these older works because they got
[SPEAKER_02]: removed from the system for a while,
mostly, you know, due to time constraints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the world of commercial herb is so
price driven, visual driven, that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very hard to show somebody a plant that
looks sparse and open, that doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily color, that has low numbers
when you measure them in the way that a
[SPEAKER_02]: lab measures a plant and has a flowering
time of, you know, 114 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that stuff just got wiped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the home grower world, you're
seeing this killer resurgence of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm digging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's been a notable
resurgence in haze and haze hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel like we're starting to see
some of, you know, the land races really
[SPEAKER_00]: start to solidify themselves back in the
mainstream conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your Vietnamese and Colombians
definitely seem to be more commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think these sort of genetics will
truly make a comeback on the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: market or is it still like a little bit
just catered for the heady scene and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of rose shade glasses about it
truly making a widespread comeback?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get some people who
discover that those profiles really
[SPEAKER_02]: resonate with them and they'll say,
Hey, you know, I found something that
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely does what I want and I'll hold
it and I'll grow it and I'll keep it and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll deal with the longer cyclical time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will, that's, that's my definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of mean that's, if you take a look at
like the PIF phenomenon in New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really, you know, haze that
groups stayed steady for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a really long time, you had enough
population base around an area that sold a
[SPEAKER_02]: product to sustain a specific cultivar
that was difficult to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it can happen in New York at the
level that it did, it can happen here as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, the issue is at the end of the
day, can you afford to cultivate it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: legal facility and then sell it for enough
money to offset the work?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I see is more of hybridization
where people will take the plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: attractive today and they'll weave in what
we would call land race work and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, indigenous work and try to bring
some of the profiles, try to bring some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the exotic, try to bring the concept of
scarcity and rarity into the marketing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what people are into too,
saying that, you know, never had it,
[SPEAKER_02]: never experienced it, very limited supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put those words out, it makes
people move.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that you're going to,
you're definitely seeing it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it's because people
are desiring to go back into the old gene
[SPEAKER_02]: pool or if we've just played the current
one out so badly that there's nothing left
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with because we intensified our
work so heavily and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in just a small genetic cluster that
there's not much left really for the
[SPEAKER_02]: average individual, the genetic world that
we're in, even though you can access genes
[SPEAKER_02]: better than you ever could, there's less
to access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I mean, I guess just to maybe
clarify the point you're touching on
[SPEAKER_00]: there, do you feel that there is much room
for, say, let's just use, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the current really, the RS11s and all
these really high, you know, power sherbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like there is much room to
make further or do you think it will just
[SPEAKER_00]: be a matter of time before all these
breeders realize like it is in fact a dead
[SPEAKER_00]: end?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're going to, you run down that
road until you hit the dead end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're still making sales and it
allows you to build off of the marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're still working off of the
concepts and ideas that the public has
[SPEAKER_02]: about what is good cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they expect it to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the world of visual cannabis
absolutely makes those varieties still
[SPEAKER_02]: unbelievably relevant because they're
aspects of visual beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't deny it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's we've steered and shaped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the thing is, when visual and price
are your two biggest indicators of a
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase and then in dispensary,
it's going to be potency and price because
[SPEAKER_02]: you really can't see the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it really difficult to get out of
those lanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that what will happen is someone
will come up with something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll discover something old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll see everyone pour into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that plant now becomes the base
for hybridization until they reach that
[SPEAKER_02]: pinnacle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've worked basically a cookie chassis
now for over a decade because everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're talking about is really a Girl
Scout cookie frame covered with a
[SPEAKER_02]: different paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even while you were talking about
that, click with me that in line with your
[SPEAKER_00]: prior answer as well, the MAC really fit
that mold you spoke about where it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Colombian injecting a little bit
of new, but it had the frost, it had it
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, I actually really enjoy
well-grown MAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people don't, but I guess I'd
love to ask you then, given the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars you see, what do you think is
going to be the front runner for 2024?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as one of our listeners put it,
do you think we're going to be stuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: purple candy gas?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to be stuck with
purple candy gas for a little while
[SPEAKER_02]: because the market's still absorbing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the market was turning its back on
it, then you would see people running out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that market and going somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it's still absorbing it,
it's still going to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to tell what's going to be
the next hot cut because it doesn't go the
[SPEAKER_02]: way you think it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hot cuts that hit the commercial
market and there's hot cuts that hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they get to touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The MAC is a good example of a plant
though, that if you look at it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it absolutely changed the game in terms of
visual and the numbers were insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it was a triploid,
it didn't produce seeds well, almost none.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, it saved the MAC's life from
being this base paint of every single
[SPEAKER_02]: plant around it because people couldn't
generate enough seed from it to
[SPEAKER_02]: financially make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't get the seed yield from the
MAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because the triploid potential in
it, it actually helped the plant remain as
[SPEAKER_02]: a clone only where to this day,
MAC still sells as a clone because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't deny that it's stunning and it's
raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it could use a little flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was a downfall to the MAC to me,
it could use some more flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in every other aspect, it pulls it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like the MAC, because it has a
genetic anomaly compared to other plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not a diploid, that allowed it to
kind of stand alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But any other plant that comes out that's
hot, that sells, people see it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets promoted by the right person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone with the big reach can push it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting it into the highlight with
a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: That moves things more than the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, the people that I see who have
the best grass, what I would define as the
[SPEAKER_02]: best grass, are the fall light tent
growers that I meet all over the US and
[SPEAKER_02]: around the world, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are absolutely looking for
freak herb that doesn't have commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're getting is the best
experience total with no, it didn't trim
[SPEAKER_02]: well under a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't hold well on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't like to be moved through distro
because it's fragile.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trikes, they break off too easy,
but it's meant to be consumed as flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of those things that make it
problematic, you won't see those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: move into a commercial system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so going to the regenerative
conferences, going to a lot of the events
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to go to, what I get to see is what
I think is the highest tier of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever seen across the board is the
production of 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's in the small operators because
they get to go do what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stores are limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like for big push plant numbers and big
push quantities, it better have numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It better have color and candy gas still
rules that world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is the solution to the
issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you just discussed,
a lot of the stuff commercially available,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really what we'd consider to be
the pinnacle of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often you need to experience that
ultra high quality to have that light bulb
[SPEAKER_00]: moment and really start to go down the
rabbit hole, at least in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think is the future for the
general consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it'll get to a point where
you just can't get this sort of herb
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about so fondly that comes
from the smaller batch production?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to get it from the
street.
[SPEAKER_02]: The small batch, the true small batch,
there's no place for you in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's so exciting even for the
bigger operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at any country that has
operations, it's in chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me a well-run system anywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not looking at any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the issue is that it completely creates
a ceiling that people can't penetrate to
[SPEAKER_02]: get into that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of it, you lock out diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to have diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have people who are obsessed
with a thing so much that they're willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to take a risk with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they know enough about what they're
doing that they produce the quantity that
[SPEAKER_02]: will sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't produce and they don't put
the plant into the market to produce a
[SPEAKER_02]: million pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only seven to 10,000 pounds of it
produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That now lets you really focus on the
group that has the money and the desire to
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows you now to be able to
justify why you're having to charge
[SPEAKER_02]: proportionately more to produce it because
it just allows you to be able to do that.
And so if you look at any country that has
operations, there's no place for you in
the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain places can do certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's indoor, you're just going
longer times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to really impact your
entire crop rotation cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nursery means the entire chain of
events that occur in an operation are
[SPEAKER_02]: dictated by that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you start to throw in rooms
that are running on 110 days versus 65s,
[SPEAKER_02]: it throws the rotation out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it becomes problematic for anybody
that's bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a small operator, I think as you
go forward and you start to see some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the markets like New York, I think is a
prime place because you have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers with enough affluence.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be the ability to sell X amount of
pounds of really exquisite flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got me thinking, you know,
we have fans all over the globe who live
[SPEAKER_00]: in these little epicenters of,
you know, cannabis growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know like the UK is a good
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you said, New York's having its
Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even in Australia, there's there's
a bunch of people who are really doing
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given your work over the years in the
NorCal area, what would be some advice for
[SPEAKER_00]: people living in these areas to help
foster a culture where it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where it helps the scene to
develop?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how can we help to let the
rising tide raise all boats?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is one of the toughest
parts about what we do is that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: culture is so much an independent one
because you have the ability to be
[SPEAKER_02]: autonomous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, for most, you're able to use your
own resources to generate a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows you to rely on you and
allows you to be in control of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for many people that,
you know, it's not that they're devoid of
[SPEAKER_02]: desire to be around others.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that being alone, working on a
project, or working with a person or so
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cripples you when you move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it cripples you because what you don't
understand is that the companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have to face and compete
with and deal with, and you will have to
[SPEAKER_02]: compete and deal with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're corporations and they're VC
driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just like I use the same example
with the police, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you when you run in back in the day
when you were running hot operations,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had to be smart because when you got
grabbed, your life changed 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the police who grabbed you went home
and had dinner and took the kid to play
[SPEAKER_02]: softball.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go home at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: The judge goes home at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prison guard goes home at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody goes home at night but you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just means that you have a
competition that you can't compete with
[SPEAKER_02]: because at the end of the day,
they can they can get rest and you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you find is that no matter how
clever you might be to go up against a
[SPEAKER_02]: really funded competitor, which is where
you're going to see them come in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost impossible because they have
the ability to throw money at a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what the smaller cultivators have
to do and which makes it so difficult for
[SPEAKER_02]: them is they have to first meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have to be able to say out
loud to each other, I'm a grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: which for many coming out of the green
closet is a terrifying thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it that alone is a huge struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have to get past that barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to get past the barrier of,
you know, do you trust anybody that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: just come clean to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now all these people know who you
really are and what will that impact?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the impact to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you start to create all these problems
just to create unity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to get the unity regardless
of the problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're able to team up as say
we're in a region, say we're we're just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to use Brisbane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to pull the word out of a
kind of a region with cultivators in
[SPEAKER_02]: Brisbane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we need to be able to do is
recognize how many of us are craft
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators in Brisbane, how many of us
have an actual chance to survive based off
[SPEAKER_02]: of what we see currently in Brisbane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would mean do we have enough
capital to acquire the licenses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have the real estate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have the means to move the product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have the relationships with the
distribution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a handle on the genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like there's all these things that have
to be developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can all get together in a
region and have that conversation,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're able to start to figure out
we're all growers, but you're a graphic
[SPEAKER_02]: designer when you're not growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm an electrician when I'm not
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this individual is a business manager
when they're not growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this other gal is an incredible
product developer when she's not growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what you have is a consortium of
talent clustered around the common hub of
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just going to say cultivation as
the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get everybody in the room
together like that, what you have now is a
[SPEAKER_02]: brain trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're able to understand that you
have to subjugate your ego to where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: only the smartest in the room in your
lane, then what it does is it allows you
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to team up and actually work
against the bigger companies that are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in because you're able to start to
figure out who of you aren't going to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if once you make that decision and
you can make it financially, then you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to say, okay, I can't create a license,
but perhaps I could work at a facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have to not be part of the industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: For people who have the money,
have the ability, they say, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us drive forward and get that secured
and let the people around us populate the
[SPEAKER_02]: operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be honest with this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard because each person
inherently believes that they're brilliant
[SPEAKER_02]: by virtue of the fact that you're not in
the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow an herb, you're having a great
life, you're making great money while
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing it at your house,
you're making coin in your fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: pajamas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for most people, that's only for
crypto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so crypto is the modern dope grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a real problem trying to get
people to see past their limitations and
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what they're going to have to
do to actually get to the place they want
[SPEAKER_02]: to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the legal industry is a meat
grinder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just because you get a license doesn't
mean you're going to succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's nothing in the path that makes
you have to feel safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm involved heavily in legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just one, every time you walk,
you feel like you're on crack and ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, on the other end of the
spectrum of that question, what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: advice for some of the people,
say stateside, who are sort of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy farmer type figures and feel like
they're getting pushed out of the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe because they're not a big brand,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think these sorts of veteran
growers are going to be able to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant and stay within the industry,
not have to find a new career?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on your other skill sets,
because in the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis might be 30% of your total
income.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have a small farm that you run
seasonally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have an operation that you have
your son and your daughter working at.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have an ability perhaps to utilize
your land in some manner, but without
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, it's very hard because the tax
rates are savage in every place we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, it's this honest,
and I've helped a lot of people with this
[SPEAKER_02]: too, because it's emotional and I don't
get emotional.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to save that when it's needed,
because otherwise it just dictates how you
[SPEAKER_02]: see every situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to look at it robotically as if I
was not connected to it in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that does is it lets you have a
conversation with somebody and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly ask them, do you want to take all
your savings and risk developing something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you better off keeping your savings
and finding some new avenue of employment,
[SPEAKER_02]: but still with your money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really about cultivating anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really want the farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have kids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your kids want the farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the questions you have to
ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we sell the assets that we've held for
time or do we keep them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we keep them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get into, for anybody legacy,
once you get into legal, you get into a
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky trap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the traps they put out to catch
mice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All it's going to do is touch your finger
and basically it sucks your whole hand
[SPEAKER_02]: into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're trapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so complex and in depth and it's such
a vacuous whole of money and you really
[SPEAKER_02]: never know how much it's going to cost you
when you get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There almost is no accurate cost
estimates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each district you work with, each
community has their own little private
[SPEAKER_02]: assault on your wallet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it comes down to like, is this
really where you want to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you see yourself coming out at the
end successfully?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to define what successful
means.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, like the example is I didn't
expect to ever get wealthy from my family
[SPEAKER_02]: farm because I knew that it was only going
to be 18,000 foot of canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a little less than half an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a lot of canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of canopy in agriculture
is 10,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when cannabis starts to be produced at
a level that's astronomical, then how do
[SPEAKER_02]: we compete at 18K?
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured we compete at 18K by having a
small enough canopy of something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: exquisite that can actually support the
farm itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the land stays solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, a success as the farmer was I
have to go do other work to have an
[SPEAKER_02]: existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I can succeed, I get to keep my
farm as an asset in my, in my family's
[SPEAKER_02]: life, which is weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're taking your lucrative weed
farm and you're saying you're probably not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make any money on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to make enough to keep
it alive because that's what you love is
[SPEAKER_02]: the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I have a love affair with that
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're on that topic, I wanted to
ask, you know, you're talking about your
[SPEAKER_00]: farm and the passion behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What genetics have got you excited at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you keen to pop yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've been working on is I've been
working on, I got enthralled with this
[SPEAKER_02]: Lebanese puck frost from crickets and
cicada seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he had done a bunch of work with
this old Skelly hash plant, these old 88
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plants out of the old Senziera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was alive then growing indoor
heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, it was like a trip back in
time to go back into those musky,
[SPEAKER_02]: funky, skunky type varieties that you just
don't really see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Lebanese female that he used just
really brought some crazy profiles into
[SPEAKER_02]: the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I smoked some with them,
there was a flavor in it that just blew my
[SPEAKER_02]: mind and I went digging for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found it was recessive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go through like a couple hundred
plants to mine what I was seeking,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was that profile in the female and
then the male that matched it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm loving it just because it's got a
different type of high where the high
[SPEAKER_02]: feels balanced more than a steered high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're doing plant development,
you're using a COA to drive shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just throw that away and you just
drive it off of how you feel from the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, what you're doing is you're
seeking the best experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no constraint from COA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really matter what it's telling
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What matters is what I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I found was that as I went
through those populations that Lebanese
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant side with a little bit of that
punk back tone just gave me this really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I felt relaxed and my head was clear
and the flavor was rich and interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: and cinnamon and rose oil and cedar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nothing against gelato or skittle
or cookie or Hennies or OG or Tam.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not against any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have any of that in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just the direction that hasn't
been explored.
[SPEAKER_02]: By many ever because it's from a time
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it was something I explored
heavily and I was able to go back into it
[SPEAKER_02]: and find something that I really liked,
which was that Lebanese side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been digging it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been doing a ton of work with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would, I would love to be able to
produce that at the farm as a product,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think it would make an A plus
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds absolutely incredible and got
to give a massive shout out to both Bob
[SPEAKER_00]: and Hanna Bob making some killer genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coincidentally, I'm fortunate enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me some unreleased seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash plant 13 crossed to the puck Mao that
he made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, really lucky to be smoking
on a sampler that got the hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, but more of the puck turps,
you know, that steak, leathery sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe, really, really beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know what's your long-term
plans with those seeds that you're making?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our listeners wanted to know,
would you ever consider making those
[SPEAKER_00]: available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that Mr. Bob is a big
advocate with people making stuff with the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing with me with like I do,
I work with a lot of companies helping
[SPEAKER_02]: them do breeding, but I'm not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I say that is because I
produce seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm really good at is selecting
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But breeders have a different strategy and
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom was the research geneticist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have a pretty clear idea of what
that looks like when you're laying out a
[SPEAKER_02]: project from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm fortunate that I get to work
with some brilliant breeders that they
[SPEAKER_02]: help you really understand how to refine
your practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I get to do really is I get
for me and my personal stuff, I get to
[SPEAKER_02]: work directions that I dig because I'm not
constrained.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not worrying about does it
mechanically trim?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have the ability to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm focusing on is does it do what I
want it to do as a drug product?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ability to do that then kind of
frees you up to be able to just look
[SPEAKER_02]: through populations and start to put
together parental combinations to find out
[SPEAKER_02]: what works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, when I'm working with
anybody's work, I've never taken someone's
[SPEAKER_02]: work and use their work to make money off
that work quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do is I take people's work and then
I contact you, say you made the work and I
[SPEAKER_02]: say, hey, you did a limited release.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did an F2 on it so that I could have a
population to hunt through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be cool if I gave out the F2 at
conferences so people could get access to
[SPEAKER_02]: your work because you only sold a thousand
packs and there's really desire for 5,000
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead of me knocking off your work
as an F2, let me just give them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done that for years because it's
a way that you get really good genes into
[SPEAKER_02]: many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I gave the F2 out all over the
globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I made a shitload.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did an open population F2 out of 56
plants, so 30 females, 26 males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put them all together at once so I could
get a good gene collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I gave those out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave out thousands of those seeds
because the quality of that hybrid was
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I wanted to do, too, was me and
Bob are friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to bring attention back to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though he was sold out of that
work, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets people to say, hey, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are good breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to mess with your company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a really good way to do
marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows me to share things with
people that I think are cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to do the first release on seed
that I'll put onto the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll do that F3 from the male and the
female that I did that big selection from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I just think they're stellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll lay that same male into my
LAPK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the LAPK, because that's super
rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it has some of the best
qualities of cannabis that you can ask
[SPEAKER_02]: for, where it has really like no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you smoke it every day,
no tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get equally as high every day and
you get equally as high every time you
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it after one after another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just has these penetrating,
resonating impacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that that plant with that
really sexy coffee chocolate earth back
[SPEAKER_02]: with that level of potency mixed in with
that cedar rose oil cinnamon from the male
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm throwing is just going to produce
some heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bet by, let's see, we're into the veg
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So springtime, springtime, I'll be
throwing some seed out to the public from
[SPEAKER_02]: that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I just think that it got me
excited because I've been playing with so
[SPEAKER_02]: many things for so long that I got bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing against any of the breeders
or any of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're all epic in their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is you start smoking the
same hybrids for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all feel the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very little difference in how it
impacts me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you become kind of bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just loses its luster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can all relate to something
that initially was really interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly becomes quite bland, especially if
you over-indulge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really exciting to hear that
there's some genetics in the woodworks and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone needs to keep their eyes and ears
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trawling through your Instagram and
I knew I had to ask you about,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like, I wouldn't call it
necessarily a sister line, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another sort of line in that realm that
caught my eye from you, which was the
[SPEAKER_00]: SensiStar lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix with the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a bit about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went into the SensiStar work that he did
too, because I still like SensiStar a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ran it outside first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny because it took me right
back to the 90s because everything we ran
[SPEAKER_02]: in the 90s was indoor built.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you took it outdoor, it rotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just didn't have the resistance,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found one of them, number 18,
that resisted really well and was just the
[SPEAKER_02]: stellar plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I took it indoor and I had my
partner run it in a steered system so I
[SPEAKER_02]: could see what it looked like in
crop-steered rockwool underleds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't have that metallic,
lemony, bitey flavor that I wanted from
[SPEAKER_02]: the SensiStar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more puck dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't really find any that had
that, though I was seeking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoke was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every single thing about it was an A.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it lacked a little flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I took a redlebpuck male
because I just wanted to bring some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: redlebpuck profile in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I took a redlebpuck male into a lemon
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did a hunt through that for a
male that would give me a combination of
[SPEAKER_02]: traits where it wasn't all lemon and it
wasn't all puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had enough of the redleb to add
some nuance to the lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I took that male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then went into that Sensi18.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, I was able to give
what I would say like an improved flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just have to go through a little more
of the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the 18 was visually a little
better than the one that I was playing
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just have to go open up the
population to 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll let me see something that had
what I wanted from the 18 mother,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with the traits of that lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem when you play with
lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon can dominate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just becomes too much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, when it comes to
consumer preference, human preference,
[SPEAKER_02]: we like things that we like, but we like
some complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we feel interested when we play with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never fully understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always like, ooh, ooh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it's just lemon or just green,
grape or just orange or just lime or just
[SPEAKER_02]: apple or just peach or just pear or just
watermelon, you get bored quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you lay some of these profiles
together, if you look at enough
[SPEAKER_02]: populations, you just realize that it
comes down to numbers where you're hunting
[SPEAKER_02]: through populations to find the ones that
have the traits you want with those
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors that mesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some in the other room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew a bush of it outdoor and it's
killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that one maybe going to be offered as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that more a personal project?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was more personal project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, you know, you just chase things
because you want to explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you if you get to work with a line
like, say, we're using puck is the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So puck is the base for all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like, I got to look at some of the
Nepalese into the puck, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Nepalese, I knew well because I
provided it to Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Nepalese was a cut I got out of
Grass Valley and it was just this
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave it to him to use in the
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I so I knew what that plant
looked like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I got to see what his puck male
did against it, it let me kind of better
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what the male's impact was on
anything else I'm using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see the impact of the puck on the
Nepalese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the impact of the male on the Sensi
star.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the impact on the male on the red
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just helps me kind of understand
better how deep am I going to have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to find what I'm seeking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes it's just you're just
hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the red lab, the problem was I
had smoked some with Bob and the sample
[SPEAKER_02]: that he had brought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he cursed me because once he once he
exposed me to that shit, I was on a
[SPEAKER_02]: tirade, man, I was going for that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took me a minute to find it because
it was really a recessive trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, one out of 100 frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if, you know, you're not going
through 100 plants, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find five in a single pack,
but like we're talking, I had to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through 100 of the F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't find it in the F1 at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to the same degree I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is that when I went into
that F2 work, I took the nine females that
[SPEAKER_02]: had the most close to what I wanted trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used that nine female pollination
from the from the 26 males into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least it started bringing down my
selection traits from the female side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, I was able to go,
OK, now what do we have and what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to come from it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I started to open up the
populations, I could find the males that
[SPEAKER_02]: took the traits that I was seeking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start to if you're not using lab
analysis, you're having to go through your
[SPEAKER_02]: intuition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having to take a look at what are
the traits that the plants are displaying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got to lay it into them and
figure out what's coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to kind of steer first to at
least neck it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to take the plants
you're working with to full fruition to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure there's no intersex,
because a lot of the plants in the past
[SPEAKER_02]: had intersex, so that you see it pop up,
male and female.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you have this beautiful
female and you're at the end of the cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: it starts to it starts to come apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that propensity for
intersexing at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want the male to suddenly reverse
at the end of its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want the female to display
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want is as much sexual stability as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from here now, we're able to
create some stable work.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're working with companies like if
I get brought into a scientific company,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's different because I'm helping them
understand the traits of desire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm helping them understand that this
smell right here smells like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody would buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the person that's saying they like it,
they're not a person to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're somebody who's an anomaly and they
shouldn't choose things for the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of helps companies fine tune
the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with scientific companies meaning that
they have the ability to utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific resources, their toolbox is
massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're able to do this all through
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me and for people who do,
you know, breeding at home in their own
[SPEAKER_02]: world, you have to be able to utilize
conventional breeding methodology and just
[SPEAKER_02]: be kind of really diligent about what it
is you're trying to get and make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: the work you're doing is the direction you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely can appreciate the sentiment
of, as you said, that distinction between
[SPEAKER_00]: like doing stuff at home versus say
working with a big company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely two different approaches there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that line of thinking, just for our
listeners at home who for the most part
[SPEAKER_00]: are not working with companies,
what sort of traits do you look for in
[SPEAKER_00]: males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any tips for our listeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow up, do you think it's an
art or more of a science or a mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: both?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a roll of the dice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about population numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, the males that
you choose sometimes really weren't the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that push the traits that you desired
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like, I always use myself as an
example where the children that I have
[SPEAKER_02]: take five are after their mother side than
me, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just means that I'm a male that
lets the female traits pass through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would be a good breeder male if you
were trying to allow the female to come
[SPEAKER_02]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I look at populations,
if I can go play with it for a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the play with it for a while part
that matters is to figure out what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: see in coming out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you put together the plants,
what seems to come out in traits in
[SPEAKER_02]: clusters?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the most number of traits you see
consistently and which males are producing
[SPEAKER_02]: that many of them at one time so that you
know that you're able to start steering
[SPEAKER_02]: and necking a population down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Outliers are tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really know how many you're
going to have to go through to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I want is I want males that I
would say are not the first flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily or the last flowering,
but in the medium cycle plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not looking for the outliers on
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for normal mid-range flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm seeking is and it's rare and I
only play with a couple of males ever
[SPEAKER_02]: because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll do open pop work to get
populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once I go and dig for a male,
it's a dig because what I want is I want
[SPEAKER_02]: some really freaky resin development.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see a male that's absolutely
covered in trikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to see it with a very powerful
pungent odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to feel natural
essential oil production on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be as impressed by the male in
its traits more than its structure than
[SPEAKER_02]: the female.
[SPEAKER_02]: The female is we can see what we have
because we can consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the male doesn't always tell us this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I can get the profile in the male,
which is rare, if I can get the resin
[SPEAKER_02]: content in the male, which is rare,
if I can get the oil production in the
[SPEAKER_02]: male, which is rare, and I get it in a
good frame that I like in a medium finish,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a male that I can play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I run it, it lets me see
what comes out of the progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I know it's good, then what I can
do now is I can take a collection of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and run it into it and preserve
them in that manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, what's a good example?
[SPEAKER_02]: I went maybe 10, 11 years ago,
we were at the what I would call like the
[SPEAKER_02]: peak of the medical world in cannabis in
California, the zenith of the industry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it fuel was taking over everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuel was just wreaking havoc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another couple of years, we were going
to go into candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just I've been doing this for so
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I took everything that we
would consider more uplifting,
[SPEAKER_02]: like so stuff like, you know, green crap,
and different haze cuts, blue dream,
[SPEAKER_02]: all these other plants of that era that
fit into that narrow leaf of ethereal type
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that I was going to have to sit on
them for a decade because it was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be no market for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I took all of those
plants that had those characteristics that
[SPEAKER_02]: were so valuable in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, this is before tissue
culture, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not banking shit, you're having
to hold a living plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I went through a
population I'd worked on that I got from
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodhi, which was a sensei star Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took that and went into it another
generation or two hunting for a male that
[SPEAKER_02]: I could use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me that that ethereal Malawi
edge, that nasty, sharp, ripping high,
[SPEAKER_02]: that loud, super loud, sharp odor,
but brought down a little bit in stature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was more workable because where I
live in Humboldt County, it has to be some
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Halloween is pretty much the
limit of what I want to play with out
[SPEAKER_02]: here, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a traditional Humboldt wet winter,
by the time you get into early November,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to be able to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to bring the African down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: His sensei star was choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I selected a male from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I used it against all those
plants and then banked the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just broke them out like six months
ago and pulled out a Blue Dream Malawi
[SPEAKER_02]: sensei star so that I can use as something
that fits the need of today, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: something ethereal, something clear
headed, but sharpened up from Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the high is similar, but the the odor
profile is a little edgier, not as soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the resin contents increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you know you have a male that you
can use, what people do is they bang it
[SPEAKER_02]: into everything they can touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, what you want to do is put it
into plants that you think will combine
[SPEAKER_02]: ideally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it lets you at least know that you
know the mother plant well, the father
[SPEAKER_02]: you've selected and developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll allow you now to be able to go
through the population and you're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: say, look, I can't hold it in pure form
unless I self it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I go this route, what it'll do is
it'll allow me to start combining the
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to do few males for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would build few males.
[SPEAKER_02]: That when you put it on a plant,
it would increase the gas and increase the
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would give that male to people
I knew that were breeders that wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: do their own breeding and say,
look, this is a male that when we put it
[SPEAKER_02]: on other plants, these are the results
from the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what it's given us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's given us good resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's given us a good a good finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning the flower is pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you when you go and put the work
in a male is priceless.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why everybody sells because it
allows you to lock the genes into an
[SPEAKER_02]: internal pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, man, a good breeder male is
priceless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a there's a lot of great knowledge
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll all have to listen to that little
bit again and extract some ideas out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, you know,
while we're sort of on this topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: what will your advice be for someone who
is maybe, say, an aspiring breeder and
[SPEAKER_00]: they feel like, you know, the market's
saturated, you know, they probably I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: the sentiment I sort of put forward is
there's no point doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: gastropop cross kushmints.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone else has probably
already done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice would you give to someone
about how they could try to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: carve their own path out without further
going down the genetic dead end we've
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to, you know, do it easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a lot of nice plants to work
with today that provide like your base
[SPEAKER_02]: chassis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say Oreo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Oreos is a plant that is an A plus in
every category, except the I would say the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor smells a little off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like in terms of resistance and I
mean, it's bulletproof, gorgeous,
[SPEAKER_02]: gorgeous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could take that as the chassis and
then put a better paint job on it and
[SPEAKER_02]: throw some flavor in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what you have now is is something
that's pretty, pretty workable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that the advice for anybody
that wants to do something is first,
[SPEAKER_02]: do it because you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it, do it because you're into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you like gastropop, you know,
Z-crosses, then that's what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter where you begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What matters is you begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that when you go to work with
lines that are extremely clustered where
[SPEAKER_02]: you have many poly hybrids that got put
together to create the hybrid,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you have is this wicked population
that pops out and it makes it very
[SPEAKER_02]: unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that if you're trying to
really understand, you know, better
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, you work with things that are a
little more necked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, that's why you got to see so much
skunk one and northern lights type work,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they were pretty consistent in
what came out from seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it allows you to play around and say,
okay, what happens when I do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it lets you find subtleties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're taking a poly hybrid and
you're hitting with another poly hybrid,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might have to open up the pop ulation
to a couple hundred to really find the one
[SPEAKER_02]: you were hoping to get because there's so
many genetic combinations possible due to
[SPEAKER_02]: the incredible heterozygosity of the gene
pool present.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much shit going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think for anybody that was starting,
just make it easy on yourself and just do
[SPEAKER_02]: it because you like it, you know,
chase the flavor profile or chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some people, it's finishing time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need something to finish in your
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some people, they need it very short
because they have low ceilings in their
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it doesn't have to be profound why
you're choosing and working with
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let that be the constraint so that
you learn how to breed towards a
[SPEAKER_02]: constraint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it intentional breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're conscious of what you're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I use use the same analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I both have dogs and we're
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not a dog breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two dogs have sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no intention to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, my female is going to produce puppies
now, but does that mean that I had any
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do I have any idea of the outcome?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think for people who are getting into
breeding, you can play with anything and
[SPEAKER_02]: open it up because it's always good to see
diverse gene pool because it lets you
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the issue in cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then work with things that you know
have been worked repetitively enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: where if you use it, you can expect some
form of consistent result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a ton of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no shortage of it online.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to go to craft readers and
look for the words F4, F5, F6,
[SPEAKER_02]: like coffee from Kaia, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody uses coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not everybody, but it's pretty
popular as a base because Kaia did a
[SPEAKER_02]: really good job stabilizing that work
initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the people who got it from
them, they took it their own route
[SPEAKER_02]: individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at like F9, F10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're in your 10th generation of
refinement breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant should give you some stability
in the outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predictability is the word really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that the small
breeder needs to see too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you work with something that's
extremely predictable and then you work
[SPEAKER_02]: with some shit that's out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get to experience the two realms
and you'll find who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for some people experiencing the
unpredictable is really what they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their hunt, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What a brilliant and practical answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like that example you gave
about the chassis and making it your own
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you spoke about, you know,
maybe flavors your thing, chase that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to chase that up because I
know that you probably know the backstory
[SPEAKER_00]: and the history on a lot of strains from
grass valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to think I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, what I know is
like what I touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes there's many of us that can
agree, okay, this seems to be the most
[SPEAKER_02]: possible story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, with cannabis, because of
the nature of it illicitly, there was
[SPEAKER_02]: always secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you get into the game of
whatever's hot, it becomes that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So DNA analysis lets us really take a look
at this picture a lot differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start to realize, like,
wow, do we really know what we have at
[SPEAKER_02]: all?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why, like, when you keep a clone
or you keep something that really
[SPEAKER_02]: resonates with you, it's best to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If at all possible, keep the plant that
resonated with you, because you do not
[SPEAKER_02]: know if you can actually get back there
because someone told you it was granddaddy
[SPEAKER_02]: perp and really it was a Nepalese Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you go buy granddaddy perp seeds
to go find that plant that you love so
[SPEAKER_02]: much, you'll never find it because you
don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that family at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, that's a valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you're reading my mind
because you know exactly where I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first thing I wanted to ask you
is, do you know or do you have any idea on
[SPEAKER_00]: the backstory of Skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like for a strain that's
made such an impact in the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: the backstory is still relatively unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering, do you know anything about
the infamous gas station Bob?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, this is a controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get exposed to Skittles from Fields
at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to call it Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, holy shit, this shit's
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, me and the boys,
we got this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I didn't get a story from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just knew that it was cracking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the moment it came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't called Skittle yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That name appeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they created it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did an incredible job marketing and
branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one day I'm at my shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this dude comes in to buy some clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, you want to smoke a joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I'll burn one with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you get that from Fieldsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, fuck him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm his father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I provided the cut to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so his story was that he went down to
Visalia to get a tray of clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that clone was a mistake in the tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I ended up grabbing the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get the cut from Fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grabbed a copy of the Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had it the whole time, too,
from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I got was I got to hang out with
Jigga.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking about, he said,
hey, I got a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I saw that you DNA'd your green
sherbet and the Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I had the green sherbet before the
Skittle, or around that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got a hold of it, I said,
these things have to be related.
[SPEAKER_02]: This flavor's too unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I DNA'd them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were related.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that relationship just was posted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when Jigga, and I hook up,
he has the same plant's DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's talking to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, what's the story?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, look, I got it from a guy that
got it from someone down in Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, that's what we figured.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had an employee that worked for him
that he believed stole plants and went
[SPEAKER_02]: down to his mom's spot, which was in
Visalia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that mean all these stories are
real?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Bob could be telling me a bullshit
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so too could Jigga.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that what I know is I'm
acquiring plants from groups that are
[SPEAKER_02]: related.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm getting the green sherbet out
of the Bay Area sherbet crew, that's in
[SPEAKER_02]: that cluster, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would that plant from them have
Skittles in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the DNA doesn't lie that they're
connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean we know how it happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we know is that there's genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that green sherbet that I kicked out
is still doing really well in the
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction circuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: People still killing it with that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, that's why I'm
saying, do you ever really know the real
[SPEAKER_02]: story?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I know is that the Skittle and
that green sherbet are most definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: related.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I know is that it's not what the
lineage says it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a grapefruit or whatever the fuck
it is that's listed on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is it's almost like we're
going to get into cookie, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So years before cookie gets released,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like before the public gets to touch it,
Alan Atkinson out of Mendo says to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: a cherry pie pollinated a Pakistani citral
Kush, the herb goes down to the Bay Area
[SPEAKER_02]: and Jigga gets that weed and gets a seed
out of it and grows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, and when the day DNA comes
out, it'll, it'll back that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I laughed and said, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And years later, when we got a DNA,
we're like, whoa, it's cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of go, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: These accidental pollinations that occur,
and then someone's fortuitous enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize what they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the, the, it isn't that you,
the problem is people claim to breed it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which then fucks them because they can't
go back on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't say, I didn't create this
because they have to say I created it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it allows there to be exclusiveness,
which lets the public believe they're the
[SPEAKER_02]: only ones that are going to get it from
that source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But down the road, when the truth comes
out, you can't back up from it because
[SPEAKER_02]: you've already said out loud 10,000 times
I made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it would be better if you just
said, I found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my skill was in recognizing its value.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that when you really go through
and start to look at a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation work that people have done,
a lot of the stories that go along,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I get into the world of Hayes and
you're talking to Neville's crew,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're talking to Sam's crew,
like each crew has their own unique story
[SPEAKER_02]: on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't jive at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking fucking not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who do you believe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to kind of choose who you
believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, no, he's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all right in their own regard,
but the problem is they're all,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all legendary figures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, I've talked to
all of them and no story ever really
[SPEAKER_02]: balances itself evenly throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I just know is that it's
incredible herb and we have a great story
[SPEAKER_02]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way, what it does, it lets you,
it lets you get away from where it came
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause at the end of the day, it's opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you bred that shit yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you fucking went to Columbia and
returned with those seeds in your pocket,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can tell me that that shit's
Colombian, that from this region and it
[SPEAKER_02]: did this, but otherwise it could,
it could, you could have bought those
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds off of any land race group and sold
them to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I collected these myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got them in a mixed pack
from somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really interesting talking points you
touched on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, sometimes you just got to
take all the stories and just take them
[SPEAKER_00]: all on board instead of committing hard to
one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what a great answer about
the Skittles, you know, so much info
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'd love to ask two quick follow
ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, do you think that the
green Sherb and the Skittles are like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe sisters from the same seed stock or
more likely to be like ones and S1 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a quick follow up to that,
does this not speak huge volumes about
[SPEAKER_00]: like the monolith that is cookies in the
sense of what they've been able to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: to the industry, both cookies and possibly
Skittles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're definitely related and we
can't, you can't tell if it's parent or
[SPEAKER_02]: child.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, you just know that they're,
they're definitely linked.
[SPEAKER_02]: No cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: What cookies was able to do was cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies was able to take the cannabis
lifestyle of the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: They recognize the people in the Bay area
wanted their own vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they build this machine of culture
that, and it's funny because people from
[SPEAKER_02]: the past in cannabis culture, you know,
they don't like the culture, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: that culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a culture for people that are 22
years old, which just like us at one point
[SPEAKER_02]: in time, that was our culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they were able to do was capture
that lifestyle imagery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got some crazy circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got, you got, you got Jigga
who digs up the cookie cut, approaches
[SPEAKER_02]: Berner, who's a musician who moves packs
that they're able to create this pipeline
[SPEAKER_02]: of this really beautiful plant that is
absolutely polar to OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OG had owned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Bay is a purple region,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Bay area has always been really
perp dominant and perp more than a color
[SPEAKER_02]: is a flavor too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's a feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's more complicated than
what people give it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a mental connection to a
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple is the color of royalty.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these little things that just
people go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was able to take this radically
different thing than OG and highlight it
[SPEAKER_02]: and pushed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet takes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet's blown up at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're like, you've had,
you had forums before, but the marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: on the internet for cookies was
supernatural.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff was flying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, who is Berner's next
door neighbor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Scherbinski.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Scherbinski lives next door to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Scherbinski is like, Hey, I got this
mail I want to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me use your cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next thing you know, you got,
you got Sherbert coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they go back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got, you got gelato coming
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're just swirling some plants
around, but what they're doing is they're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting together some really incredible
work because you can't deny the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: billions and billions and billions of
dollars of that flower sold and still
[SPEAKER_02]: sell, which means people must have liked
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They must have liked the appearance and
they must have liked the flavor and the
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Scherb hits, you know, he hits a ball
clear out of the planet with his first
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just this coincidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in the Bay area at the right time
with the right guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Scherb's a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew how to brand and push.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to do the hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at Skittles, I think,
pace the strain, bro, is about as funny as
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like their whole, the whole Z thing and
the, I mean, they just basically stole the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole brand from, from, was it Wrigley,
but they did such a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just excellent imagery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at Skittle, you know,
anything that's that has Skittle in it is
[SPEAKER_02]: worth 18% more in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was data that the company that
sued him dug up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read the whole lawsuit, so I was just so
fascinated with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the claims on financial damage were
there because they said, Hey, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles and weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sells for an average of 18% more than
herb that doesn't have Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Skittles has a flavor that's absolutely
hyper addictive to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me something right now that's not,
that's hot, that doesn't have it in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's gotta be 50% of the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you add gelato, now you're up to
80% of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you add triangle cushion,
you finished the fucking job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're basically covering the fucking
whole thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just some brilliant marketing,
but you can't deny that people must have
[SPEAKER_02]: loved it or they wouldn't buy it and use
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, cookies, cookies,
brilliance was that they just,
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at, I look at cookies, like I look
at like DC shoes, like I look at other
[SPEAKER_02]: like skate brands, lifestyle brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at them like Red Bull, where Red
Bull is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're an energy drink, but really
they're a media company that what they
[SPEAKER_02]: market is adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what, what cookies markets is,
is this, you know, urban lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you're wearing flashy shit and you
got cool trendy clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every store has it, my shit, I have a
cookie store, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So every, every store has its own clothing
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to get something from the
one log, you got to buy it from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with some really brilliant shit,
when it comes down to addressing how
[SPEAKER_02]: people behave in the, in the current
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the issue so many have is
it's so contrary to the way we behave
[SPEAKER_02]: prior because we weren't flashy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were far more subdued.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lived in much more obscurity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying not to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying not to yell loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would, we were moving our herb because
the market had not enough herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was sucking out of your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he did was created a marketing
machine that's absolutely unparalleled in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see anybody in any country.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really doing what he's doing in
promoting the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's bigger brands, but I don't think
anybody is, is, is he's done a better job.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no celebrity brands that work that
don't connect to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's definitely paved the way for a
lot of people, a lot of jobs, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: put food on table for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I always think about
whenever I read criticisms of burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, it's kind of undeniable,
the, uh, the success and the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the influence he's had on the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to, to quickly loop back though,
to the, the Skittles we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, it was, it was the phylos testing,
which revealed that link initially between
[SPEAKER_00]: the green shove and the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously a few years ago,
the whole catastrophic burn down of phylos
[SPEAKER_00]: was, was quite a sort of prominent
discussion point when some of their future
[SPEAKER_00]: plans came to light and some of the issues
around the storage and selling of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about it all now that the
dust has settled and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how, how do you feel in the context of how
the story all unfolded?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fuck, I feel, I feel the same now as
I did then.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the, the truth of it is, is what I'm,
I'm, I'm, I'm the work with phylos for a
[SPEAKER_02]: decade, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I met them when they were in a laboratory
in the basement of a university in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they asked me to come in to speak to
them about, um, the world of, of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked them, what do you guys do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, what we want to do is we
want to be able to do the research for
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, you don't, you don't want to
get involved in breeding yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, no, what we want is we want the
ability to just do the research because
[SPEAKER_02]: then we don't have to go raise the money
for infrastructure for cultivation and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the other associated pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all, um, PhD level geneticists.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we want to be able to do is take the
information from the farmers, go through
[SPEAKER_02]: it, and then go to their farms and help
them do the actual project.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're from the science end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the cultivation end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Hey, I said, I like that
because what I was trying to do at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time was when we did it, we were able
to put the Appalachians into Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even though they're not technically
true Appalachians because cannabis is an
[SPEAKER_02]: indigenous to Humboldt County,
we were able to take the ideas of
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachians and then how they modified
them for American grape is amended
[SPEAKER_02]: viticultural agreements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, what the point
of it is, is that I wanted to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: start having a relationship with a genetic
company that would allow us to start
[SPEAKER_02]: developing and building things that fit
our farms optimally, that we would then be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to license or protect and have the
ability to operate in a scarce model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that the small farms that were getting
the Appalachian, that's a distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the Appalachian is really in effect,
it means that the genes and the place
[SPEAKER_02]: merge and create a very unique impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ability to have a gene company and to
develop these plants that you own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the only person that has this
product is your farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me allows small operators to be able to
fight in the future because it's only way
[SPEAKER_02]: you can, you have to have better plants
and you have to have unique plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get together and work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this shit started going south for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because I don't talk about
it too much, but what took place was the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry wasn't at the level it needed to
be to work with scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what happened was they made an
assumption, which was wrong, that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers were going to be able to operate
on a very consistent level that a
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific project requires.
[SPEAKER_02]: And science requires a lot more than you
think it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're talking multi-year projects,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I'm not a scientist, so I don't
pretend to be one either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just work with shit loads of them for
decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I know is that it's attention to
fucking detail that really separates good
[SPEAKER_02]: science where you are absolutely myopic on
the fucking data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there can be no deviation or there's
chance that it won't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was putting them in contact with
farms, large farms, large operations to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was failing because the growers
didn't want to show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't need to show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was still making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not making the 4,000 a pound you
made, but you're making 2,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't really realize you're about to
make 300 a pound, but in your mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're still balling out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're showing up when you should want
to show up and you're not really having
[SPEAKER_02]: any kind of inspections from the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're still using all kinds of crazy
shit secretly in your facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not following protocol in any way,
shape or form because you didn't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: because herb had always been like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herb wasn't a well-oiled machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bunch of clanky fucking gears
that worked because there was a market
[SPEAKER_02]: that wanted so much herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't possibly fill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a shortage of product that made all
of us feel like we were smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, once the fucking products filled in,
does everybody feel so smart now?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be smarmy about it like,
my pot's better than the big person,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're having to work at the fucking
coffee shop just to pay your rent because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting the shit kicked out of you
and your weed game.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us knew this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a feeling, I did, I had a
premonition that this shit was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was trying to develop all my
relationships so that when the dust
[SPEAKER_02]: settled, we would still be able to
function in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would still be able to have an ability
to create a value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it was land pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew we were going to get butchered,
but I didn't want to have to sell my
[SPEAKER_02]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something I wanted to give to my
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got this, like this, that,
that's an emotional piece of me,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm hanging onto this land.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get involved with them to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tied them into all these people and I'm
not going to name who they work with,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Jesus Christ, these are people that
are fucking big today and absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, Hey, this isn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to go raise money
because we can't, and they already raised
[SPEAKER_02]: money to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They already had to buy all the
sequencers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to go buy all the tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had hired the scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they got this entire fucking company
they're building with, with expectation of
[SPEAKER_02]: payment of that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody fucking loaned them the cash and
now they can't pay it back because they
[SPEAKER_02]: can't actually do the job that they set
out to do because the people they were
[SPEAKER_02]: working with weren't ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it isn't that cannabis people are too
stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they weren't ready for the
realization that they were going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: to get the fuck up in the morning early
and be there on time in a facility that's
[SPEAKER_02]: clean and normal, because that's not what
the norm was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I mean, I've been to a million,
I've been the million, but I've been as
[SPEAKER_02]: many grows as anybody I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen grows all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look radically different now than
they did in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cleanliness, the, just the,
just the overall, like the improvement of
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation practices has improved
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to go raise the money,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, they send the CEO out there to
go raise the loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes to a conference, somebody films it
and they say, Oh, look at this fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying we have all the data,
which doesn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have all the data you wanted,
but until you go run it through a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencer for 10 years, there's,
there's very little value.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for people who are investment,
it's sexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he says, you know, cannabis
people can't breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of like, scientific breeding,
they can't because they don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not corn breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they took it personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would too, because, you know,
the words coming out of his mouth are bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you got to remember the guy was
pitching for money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always use the same analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You went out on a date and somebody filmed
you talking to this girl that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they filmed all your words and no one
knew, but, but the fucking cameraman that
[SPEAKER_02]: you were speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so therefore your honest shit was
coming out your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: How fucking well do you paint yourself
when you're trying to pitch for a date,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're pitching for an investor,
that shit's even worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were trying to make it look like you
are just absolutely are the greatest,
[SPEAKER_02]: sure as bet in human history, because
you're asking them to give us money to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my, and it's funny, I never really
hung out with Mowgli much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mowgli was the CEO.
[SPEAKER_02]: My connections were the COO and one of the
founders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ralph and the Sean were the guys I
dealt with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all their scientists and I knew
Mowgli, but we really never spent much
[SPEAKER_02]: time together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was always hella nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was definitely a brilliant dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in, in terms of like intellectual
capacity for being a breeder, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: holy shit, he was absolutely razor sharp,
but Mowgli made the mistake of insulting
[SPEAKER_02]: an industry that was on their hands and
knees, getting the shit kicked out of them
[SPEAKER_02]: by the money already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would just get shelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what they said was the only thing
we have is our genetics and that we know
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant better than these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he says, Hey, I already have your
data and I don't need you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone felt invalidated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because I, and it's funny cause I
get jammed into it too, because I had the
[SPEAKER_02]: largest data collection on the,
on the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I was doing, and that was through
the future cannabis, what was that called
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not future cannabis project, but it was
with Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a bunch of them, they came to me and
said, Hey, there's a group that's putting
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics into a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put your genes in, it'll open
source it in a sense that nobody can claim
[SPEAKER_02]: it as theirs because you've stated that
it's been in prior use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I took the entire
collection I had amassed and I put it into
[SPEAKER_02]: public domain so that anybody that I'd
ever sold a clone to that was making money
[SPEAKER_02]: with it would be able to make money
forever using it because nobody owned it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but them or me or anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had no ownership because I'm the one
that put it on the galaxy and I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: claiming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the funny thing is, is I start
getting hit by people screaming at me
[SPEAKER_02]: about how I fucked them on the data and
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm laughing and I'm like,
I'm the one that gave you the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't steal your genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saying that the SFV cut that that's
on the galaxy that they have the data
[SPEAKER_02]: from, and that's stamped is somehow
directly fucking you and you're mad at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm part of it, but I'm the one
that gave you the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you don't have an ability to
own it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took my whole collection and opened
it up to the public in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was like from Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then Rob and then half fallen out
with Mowgli.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even know the story on that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that when you put plants that
are sequenced into the open air,
[SPEAKER_02]: it means that there's a prior knowledge of
that plan existed, which means that for
[SPEAKER_02]: the rest of my career, I can roll G Kush
and never have to listen to one fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me I can't or anyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew what I was trying to do because
those are the plants that, and it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was the idea that these plants are the
ones that I had used to build my world,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we had collected and held and stored
and moved and bred and created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, this, this population of plants
was our lifeline that we had all worked
[SPEAKER_02]: years with people I had received them
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them people were dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's like, I'm somebody who's been
holding plants in quantity for decades,
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly moving plants, millions of
fucking plants through my hands for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, what I wanted was that base
population to be everybody's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from this point forward,
you would go and develop your own work and
[SPEAKER_02]: license it because that's the only way
you're going to compete as a small
[SPEAKER_02]: operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot run the same plant that a big
brand has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane because they're going to kick
your ass and price.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to drop the price seven
bucks and you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to buy you a better
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to buy $7 cheaper weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people argue with me,
I laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, and you own a store and have a
cash register.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me on this one, drop the price seven
bucks and watch that shit walk out the
[SPEAKER_02]: door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's got three legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this whole thing was this war over what
took place and the idea that filing laws
[SPEAKER_02]: had a gene gun that they could use to
shoot the DNA code from the sample that
[SPEAKER_02]: was sent and recreate new material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, so let me get this straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's got a fucking gene gun that
they can recreate shit from the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're using it to create your
fucking plant of all the things in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world that I could restore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need your weed cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shit got nuts and it got so out of
control because it became this witch hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody who had ever worked with the
company had to basically tell them to fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: off so that they didn't get attacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as they did, the public had
crucified them anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm involved in this shit and I'm
watching it go down and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what a fucking debacle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the company hits me up and says,
Hey, you're getting hammered on this shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like losing their mind over
this because you're not, you're not saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that we lied to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm saying, no, you didn't lie to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not trying to steal anyone's
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know how it panned out, but what
you're saying to me is that if I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: throw you onto the bus, you're okay with
that to save my neck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, we would rather
you say that like we lied to you and
[SPEAKER_02]: screwed you because we feel bad that
you're getting so attacked in the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, listen, I said, anytime
anybody says that they'll take the beating
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's who I stick with because the
public, who the fuck is the public?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like honestly, like where is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a fucking entity that floats around
in the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: It varies day to day, minute by minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I know is I'm not an internet
entity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the net a lot because I spend time
doing stuff like this, but my whole world
[SPEAKER_02]: was built off of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know me, you know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't like me, you don't like
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But over the years, it's been pretty
stable and solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to stick with the group
that knows me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the internet world decides that
they just can't deal with me, then so be
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go into purgatory on in the web,
but I'm not going to dump you as a,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a, as a friend, because you're telling
me, Hey, you can make, you can make it
[SPEAKER_02]: look like we screwed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, it all dies
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they end up doing is they end up
spending, you know, the next six,
[SPEAKER_02]: seven years developing incredible CBD
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all these seed lines,
and they went into the almost 20% THCV
[SPEAKER_02]: gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're seeing a 20% THCV release
from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the stuff that they wanted to do,
which was create seed lines, do plant
[SPEAKER_02]: development, all of that had to happen in
a way they never intended it to happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: which really cost them a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to raise and get dilution because
at the end of the day, what they wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: do was just be data scientists and play
with your toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a good lesson because at the
end of the day, a team of brilliant people
[SPEAKER_02]: that could gather money still went down
the wrong road because of the assumption
[SPEAKER_02]: that the people they were going to work
with would be able to play at that level
[SPEAKER_02]: currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you're seeing this shit
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's, there's no shortage of
DNA people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no shortage of this and
everybody's screaming and yelling about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but they were the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you film that raise and you get
them on, tape saying cannabis people don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a, it was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you really spend time around
breeders, real breeders, then you realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, you're, you're a hobbyist
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend time with someone who invented like,
you know, GMO corn where they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, no, what I did is I modified a
genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can produce enough corn to feed
1.2 billion people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's levels to the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start to play with these
people at that level, you understand,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not, I'm not a real breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, my mom was a research
geneticist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in a house with a woman doing
fruit fly experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I know is that if you're not that
you're not the, that title.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I never call myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get called constantly, but I'm not,
I'm a selector.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with breeders, helping them
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is the market wants and needs and
what the cultivator wants and needs and
[SPEAKER_02]: what the processing manufacturing supply
chain wants and needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it lets me come in and work with
them in huge populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can say, okay, let's look for the
outliers and mark them and now look for
[SPEAKER_02]: those traits on the, on the tree and start
to figure out how do we identify those
[SPEAKER_02]: traits in the progeny so that we can do
more selective work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the end of the day, you know,
it's, it's, it's was probably the most
[SPEAKER_02]: controversial thing I've ever been
involved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this idea that I was like
nefarious where I had sold all these genes
[SPEAKER_02]: to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't, they were all genes that I
open sourced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that never in history, could anybody
take your OG Cush cut a sour cut,
[SPEAKER_02]: any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't own it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And say to someone else, they can't have
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what pissed people off
is because people started to think that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, how can it be yours if I
gave it to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that's, that's a really awesome
recount of the whole series of events from
[SPEAKER_00]: your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I certainly, certainly can
appreciate it from your point of view much
[SPEAKER_00]: more than before hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm, I'm in your school of
thought, you know, I, um, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone was really expecting it in that
sense, but it's cool to hear they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: producing some work as a, as a quick
follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know, um, do you think we will
get to the point where the genomic testing
[SPEAKER_00]: does what everyone dreams of it doing,
where you can test any random plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll tell you exactly where it's all
coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, no, it can't because you have to
have something to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't have, uh, if I don't have a DNA
tree, it's frail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it just, you get to sequence
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there's nothing that you can
compare it to from that place,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you don't know that it came from that
place until you go to that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And find something that you can mark and
say, Oh, look, this is indicative of
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is indicative to the Milana Valley in
India.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll never give us that info,
but it doesn't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what it's really for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's to allow you to use a tool that
helps really speed up populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to get to, uh,
a result speed is kind of important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without using genomics, this kind of
like AI, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, what's a good example?
[SPEAKER_02]: An AI group speaks to me and where we've
been talking about a project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they, they're not cannabis AI.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just big ag AI, which is what they
provide is they provide the AI to big ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they reach out to me and say,
Hey, we want to talk to you about using AI
[SPEAKER_02]: in the development of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, how do you, and how do we
speak to the computer?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the questions we ask?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started to do my own research on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could kind of better understand the
tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I sat down with some of their
lead breeders, it was that an individual
[SPEAKER_02]: can look at maybe 2000 things using
genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at 900,000 things using AI on
top of genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at 900 million different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you start, when you start to get
up into this idea that we can like explode
[SPEAKER_02]: this, we can start to look for things that
are patterns that we just can't look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the computer says, Hey, this is some
interesting shit over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's explore it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the computer allows you to choose
plants you would have a million years
[SPEAKER_02]: chose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you put them together,
what you get is unbelievably unique
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations that we just don't have the
ability to understand at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, that's why I've always been
involved in all these different operations
[SPEAKER_02]: of this, of this type is that I need to
understand where I'm going to land.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not worrying about where I am today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always worried about where I'm going
to end up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I know is that I have to look
down the road and say, okay, if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go and get heavy into something,
when does it coincide?
[SPEAKER_02]: When does it connect, tie and intersect
with someone who has better resources?
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the genes, it's critical to
understand it because the minute you have
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule three, you, what you have in the
United States now is the ability for real
[SPEAKER_02]: companies to come in that can take
financial risk because it is because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the schedule one, if a real company,
one that's global was to put an operation
[SPEAKER_02]: in the U S they could theoretically lose
it to the federal government because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the state, so there's a state law and
there's a defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had this conversation with,
with enough of these people to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're at a level financially that
they don't really care if they're in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis right now, the day they get in
cannabis is when it's right for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the minute they're here, they will
change it at a pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be frightening because they can
spend $2 million a day on R and D only.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I know is that that combined with
marketing combined with license combined
[SPEAKER_02]: with, with what happens when you put
enough money into political systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden, like where do we exist?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the, the existence is really as a
small craft operator to me is to go and
[SPEAKER_02]: find the inability to, to, to find a lane
where this profile is attractive and you
[SPEAKER_02]: only sell 1100 pounds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that the world can accept
1100 pounds of your unique profile and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're able to stay within a very specific
situation, that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, and if the plant's lucrative
enough, you can be approached by a larger
[SPEAKER_02]: brand to say, Hey, we want to produce
another 5,000 pounds of it under these
[SPEAKER_02]: constraints, meaning we'll do it and live
in soil as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll, we'll do it as how you say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's like the cotton candy
grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got a grape in the U S that's just,
it took me a year to find a batch of that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care where I went.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got there, I finally caught it from
a great dealer who had a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different grapes on a stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to experience it firsthand
because it's so hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't hold it in the store and it
sells for twice the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the individual that bred it,
they produce it, but they also licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: that grape to other individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's, that's how this world
will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just have to understand that,
that when we get into the future,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it'll be like every other industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Samsonite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Samsonite makes a lot more luggage than
Louis Vuitton, but Louis holds a really
[SPEAKER_02]: good place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but Louis was real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louis, Louis sold, you know, luggage to
the Zarina.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sold it to the elite.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was an incredible sewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did something unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't just hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he launched a reputation that they
maintained with meticulous quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why can't, why can't we copy those
luxury brand models the same way and allow
[SPEAKER_02]: the larger corporate corporations to do
what they do because you don't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: control of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really tell them what they can
and can't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually an idea I've been
really trying to push for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years now, because there are some people
in the community who get quite upset when
[SPEAKER_00]: someone tries to produce a really high end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to point out at the same time
that a lot of these people probably aspire
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a nice Mercedes or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, why can't we have luxury
items within our field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't people be allowed to strive to
produce a really high end product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, without, without doubt, what we have
now is high end branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some, and there's some farms
that produce some good herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No question.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really good grass floating
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that the, the cost of pushing
the marketing, the cost of getting all
[SPEAKER_02]: that hype, how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to give up a chunk of your
company when you give up a chunk of your
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're having to satisfy someone
else's desires and needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you start to lose control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, it's,
it's, it's a frightening thing for many
[SPEAKER_02]: people because they got into cannabis
because they were in control.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lets you have control of your basic
day-to-day function, where when you went
[SPEAKER_02]: to work, it was under your direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made the choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to work around the clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had operations all over the place,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I'm running operations that,
that it made sense for me to go there at
[SPEAKER_02]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made sense to me to pull in the
driveway at six in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every spot I created and built and lit up,
I would enter and exit that place at the
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate times because I could,
because I didn't have a normal life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I'm a career dope grower,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm jumping from scene to scene,
lighten these things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allowed me to be me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I had, when I wanted, when I
realized this world was going to change,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to take a job at a dispensary and
mind you it was running it, but I hadn't
[SPEAKER_02]: had a job until like 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go take a job so that I could
learn how to be normal again and show up
[SPEAKER_02]: on a schedule that wasn't the one that I
lived on, which was 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like there's a period of time it takes
you to acclimate from what we used to do
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you're going to be currently
doing and you got to practice before you
[SPEAKER_02]: get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's just a shock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't just transition like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like for me, I'm white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I, I go out in the sun, I get a bad
burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to condition myself and I work
outside in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm not wearing that and putting on
some shit, I'm looking like a barbecue
[SPEAKER_02]: potato chip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care how many years I've been
doing this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So every season I have to acclimate slowly
to the intensity of the sun or I just get
[SPEAKER_02]: horrifically burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's the same process you
have to go through to go from where we
[SPEAKER_02]: were, who we were to where we want to be
and who we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to give up the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely appreciate the point
you're making about people who are being
[SPEAKER_00]: so used to the autonomy and having to just
relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think being a good grower sort of makes
you a bit of a control freak in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in your last answer, you know,
you're talking about defining your own
[SPEAKER_00]: path with unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask you about a plant that
I saw from your Instagram page that seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the post basically spoke about
how you have a skunk plant that is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the same skunk that Sam the
skunk man had used to genetically map it
[SPEAKER_00]: or something somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, did I read that correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from Salmon Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was in the Salmon Creek area since
the early 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got it when Lawrence passed
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So me and Lawrence Ringo were friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he passed away, there was just
any time you lose the patriarch of a
[SPEAKER_02]: family, there's some chaos and some plants
started dying off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the person that was the librarian
said, hey, could you could you take this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and and hang on to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was and I said, what's the story on
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it's an old skunk out from 1981
out of Salmon Creek, which is a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a production watershed directly
across from my hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Miranda, Salmon Creek's across the
river.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I I have a DNA and it matches up with
the one that Sam had entered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for whatever reason, it ties in
genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was it was stunning in the sense
that it was the old it wasn't the skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was seeking, which is what we're
all seeking like that, the urine skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this musky, floral, rich,
but I mean, to the level that when you cut
[SPEAKER_02]: some clones from it, it would fill a
building like you didn't have to flower
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant to release the volatile sulfurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just cut the plant as a plant
and it literally filled the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was incredibly, incredibly volatile and
pungent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it it was I was fascinated because it
it started really making me want to go
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the the times prior when I had a
lot of these type of plants and it kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: lit a spark to go on that skunk hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dove into that pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up getting an 88 cut out of Spain
shipped in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a company in Spain had held it
since 88 and they had used it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation line in a lot of their work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had these two cuts that were really
pretty unique in their own regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even when I went into them and I went
into other populations, I never pulled up
[SPEAKER_02]: what I found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I know I know it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no there's no mystery or miracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of when you you're
going to see it with the OGs right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: where right now everybody's starting to
release gas seeds again and everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to buy gas seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aficionado just did a nice release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did the Larry to the sky,
which they got for me back in 2010 from
[SPEAKER_02]: the HPRC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those things that were just being sold
normally, you can't find it all anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he he releases gas into the world
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because nobody kept the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody went candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you give it 10 years, I'd like to
see how many gelato 40 ones are floating
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the same thing, once it gets out
of vogue, you don't keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years from now, where will the gelato
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very circular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things come and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quick follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That old skunk cutting, the one that's the
same as Sam's.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the effect like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think it's got one of those old
world highs where it doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it had a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good feel weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the Dutch skunks, you know,
the only skunks that had like a really
[SPEAKER_02]: brutal, grisly effect were the super acrid
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were almost a little rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for people who, you know, they didn't
want that beating, they didn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went for the more lighter profiled
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, you know, I didn't mind the
fact that it made my eyes bloodshot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't mind that it made my tongue
feel like it was coated and that I had,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, swamp breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mind that it just it took control
of me like, wow, like you're reeling under
[SPEAKER_02]: the weight of the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, many didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that 81 and the 88, the 88 was
more like a burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that had a sharper edged high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say almost reminds me more like
of a Mexican effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the 81 was more like a warm blanket,
enveloping, relaxing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: big, thick, full smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be tough to sell that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't sell that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to rename it completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd have to rely on the odor because
the numbers, the numbers never lined up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, you know, maybe 16, maybe 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the numbers came out at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put that on a label.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit's not going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, you know, really hairy and
kind of fluffy red, you know, beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: herb, but not the not the the nuggie hand
grenade that people want to see today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely wasn't purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's tough, you know, and you put skunk
one, it's a bequeath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they you need to say, you know,
the piss skunk or something that and then
[SPEAKER_02]: prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the issue with some of those is
that they don't have a place except in
[SPEAKER_02]: your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they they they have a place in terms
of they let you mark things in a timeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you touch that, you get to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, when I look at plants, what I look
at is the world that you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shapes what's sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're so your sociological conditions
influence what people consume and why they
[SPEAKER_02]: consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The world around you shaping your desire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I can look at 30, 40 years worth
of plants, it lets me look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: populations that consumed it differently
because these plants were unbelievably
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold a tremendous amount of flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means many, many, many people enjoyed
consuming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lets me get a window into what the
people of the world were doing at that
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you get into our era,
it'll be easy to say, hey, look at these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and look at how focus went to
visual, because what do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: We spend most of our time looking at
visuals on phones.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the next one?
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we get past this one, what's the
next technical sociological revolution
[SPEAKER_02]: that occurs?
[SPEAKER_02]: That absolutely impacts how we see a
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, that's the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one I really can't answer
because what's going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: breakthrough that changes it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can't smell herb in the stores
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't look at the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can look at it, it means it's
getting light degradation through the
[SPEAKER_02]: package.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're damaging the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to seal the weed so you can't
see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't open it and smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have no idea what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you sell it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're selling it off of the bud tenders,
steering people into choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea that somebody, and it's not a
knock to bud tenders because I've met some
[SPEAKER_02]: brilliant ones, it's just that for so
many, it's an introductory level job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they haven't had enough time to be
able to really work with a population or
[SPEAKER_02]: many populations long enough to kind of
see patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it makes it kind of hard to get
accurate assistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the whole point of the Gangier,
where to develop a common language,
[SPEAKER_02]: common rating systems, common terminology,
so that when someone went into a store,
[SPEAKER_02]: they could say the same thing in every
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost every person that worked at a
store could say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go to a butcher shop,
they don't call hamburger filet mignon.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it hamburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to go, I need the meat
that's run through the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go hamburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody says the same thing,
hamburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows you to go, I need hamburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's our issue is that we're so
confused in terminology that no one has an
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the statistics are something like
85% of the people that come out of a store
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't tell you the name of the brand
when they get home.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know the name of the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: 85%, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 15% are going, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why does cookies work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you go into a cookie store.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you go into any, and cookie sells
other products as well, but you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: a cookie collection of products,
which then lets them monitor the velocity
[SPEAKER_02]: of those products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it lets them know, are the sales
declining in a thing or increasing or
[SPEAKER_02]: staying the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that lets us at the R&D facility know,
do we need to produce more things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to create more things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have enough things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something that should be run for
another six months?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something that should be retired?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're able to monitor the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're able to understand the
consumer's buying patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's miserable for small operators
because you're competing against bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: brands that can come in and kind of
overwhelm the storefront, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: with choices and selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it becomes a huge amount of effort
for the small operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to basically go to every
dispensary that sells their product and
[SPEAKER_02]: spend some time with the sales team.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a perfect world, they'd actually bring
them out to the farm so they could see
[SPEAKER_02]: what products were being created and then
understand why you choose it and what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this way, when the tender has someone
come in and says, hey, what I really like
[SPEAKER_02]: is organic sun-grown herb just seems to
vibe with me better as a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like it to have a great
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the person says, oh, I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some organic sun-grown farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of them have some flavors that
we sell from the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they can quickly look and say,
OK, there's a couple here that have some
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor profiles that say grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole thing took us 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you need is these quick,
quick transitions of customer to purchase
[SPEAKER_02]: to leave because no customer wants to
spend three hours in the store trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy a bag of grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a social thing for some.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's say 95% just want to go in and
buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go buy milk, I don't want to spend
three hours getting a back story on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cow that they squeeze the milk from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want the damn milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's so true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are really sort of going
in with limited background knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, 80% of the time,
that's a staggering statistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Gunjia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely wanted to chat about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you're credited as the
co-founder slash founder of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to talk about,
what was the genesis of it like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this idea come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, originally, the genesis was I was in
the kitchen at my house with my son,
[SPEAKER_02]: my teenage son.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my son, he's 20, 20, 28, 29.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was probably, you know,
like 15, 16 at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're hanging out and I'm talking
to him and I'm like, what do I call
[SPEAKER_02]: myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'd always been a dope grower,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was running a nursery and I was
doing storefront work and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing so much different stuff that I
didn't really know my job title.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, it was like, I'm like,
who am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when someone says to you and you have
to answer it in a one word, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: or one sentence answer, how do you give
someone one sentence when you're doing 10
[SPEAKER_02]: different jobs at scale?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was hitting it at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, who am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my son looked at me and he goes,
dad, you're a ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a cannabis culturalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, whoa, that's heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, you do all things herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was just this killer name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went back to my business with my
team and said, Hey, my son came up with a
[SPEAKER_02]: cool name.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do like a blog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, no, let's create an
entertainment company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we created a platform called the ganja
when it was a website and it was the first
[SPEAKER_02]: place that a lot of different individuals
got to write on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what we did, we got to see people
that I thought were, were competent in
[SPEAKER_02]: their respective craft and allowed them a
place to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, it was meant so that when
individuals that were looking in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis for answers, there was a place
where the people that were on a platform
[SPEAKER_02]: actually should be answering the
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we turned it into the golden tarp
awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was the cannabis competition I
created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we used it for all our spring
seat events.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use it as this, this incredible
entertainment education platform locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just killed it for what we did with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, we were absolutely
bringing bodies into seats at all these
[SPEAKER_02]: venues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cannabis cup we created was the
second largest in America to this day
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of Tim Blake's Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, we were bigger than any high
times cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were bigger than any dope cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like we nailed it right out the
gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was because we were trying to
really build an awareness of the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I wasn't trying to pay homage to
the past continuously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm living it real time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, we need to focus on the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise we're going to be living in the
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not where you really live.
[SPEAKER_02]: You live in the past when you're 90,
but you young and you're living in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past, you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we used it to drive a momentum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really a successful situation,
but the world of cannabis cups came to a
[SPEAKER_02]: close just because it becomes such a
unbelievably financially burdensome type
[SPEAKER_02]: venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like most of these are basically your ride
and sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the world ended for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just said, it doesn't make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had been doing a bunch of education
for Green Flower and they approached me
[SPEAKER_02]: and said, hey, we'd like to buy the name
and the brand from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had this idea about taking
what you're doing and creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had been asked to do one prior,
but I didn't think that I was smart enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to do one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think that, I didn't think
anybody was, I didn't think any one person
[SPEAKER_02]: was bright enough to cover the world of
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, to me, weed was so huge that
just to say you think you had your hand
[SPEAKER_02]: around it meant you didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said to them, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, no, no, Kev, we were,
we, we, we reached out and created a team
[SPEAKER_02]: and we want to let you see who the team
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took a look at the team and it was
such a well-rounded group.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, 17 other people from
every facet of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that was enough people to have
a pretty good perspective on this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Hey, I can support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let, let me, let me, I'll become a
partner in Green Flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can take the gunshot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come in and help do whatever I can to
steer and build this hundred year vision
[SPEAKER_02]: you have, which is standardizing language
and creating an ability for the customer,
[SPEAKER_02]: any customer consumer, to have a full
awareness and understanding on how to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at a very complex topic in a manner that
benefits them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't meant for the sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really at the end of the day,
how do people who were coming into weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do they get an education that allows
them to actually maximize their value and
[SPEAKER_02]: their experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that it had like such a long
standing organic development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really awesome to hear the way it
progressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my first question is,
do you like, you know, hope that one day
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes the cannabis equivalent of like
the W set wine and spirit qualification,
[SPEAKER_00]: like something like that, where it's maybe
going to get people like certain jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: might open up with that, or what sort of
your long-term vision with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: My long-term vision is the ability to be
able to create an awareness of product
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two points on the data line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know what's the absolute best,
regardless of price and what's the best
[SPEAKER_02]: for the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those two points give us the two
places we need to exist in the world of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% of the people are going to want what's
best at a price.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% want what's best at any price.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we differentiate them?
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to be through a grading system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to be a defensible system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be one, just like with wine,
you have to be able to say, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I evaluated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the things that I noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the things I liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the things I did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to be able to communicate it
to somebody in a way that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: believe, both producer and consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we spent, I swear to God,
we spent something like 7,000 man hours
[SPEAKER_02]: over two years developing that program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the fights were unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until you're brawling it out with Frenchie
and he's yelling at you in that accent,
[SPEAKER_02]: you haven't had a good time because we're
all fighting over not who's right,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what's best, what matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first time I think I'd ever
been involved in a cannabis endeavor where
[SPEAKER_02]: the participants really, for the absolute
most part, were really trying to work
[SPEAKER_02]: together collaboratively to figure out
what is a well-rounded education and then
[SPEAKER_02]: what is an assessment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was nice was that Derek Gilman's
desire was really, he had an affinity for
[SPEAKER_02]: small farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he wanted it to be able to really
highlight the fact that these small farms
[SPEAKER_02]: had private farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had small products that were rating
in the high 90s, but they had low 30s on
[SPEAKER_02]: their marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high 90 on the package should really
help with the marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Derek, which was awesome because
I'm a small farmer, but you need to have
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that are managing partners also
have that same vision or it just isn't the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having Derek as the managing partner
was excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Derek is a really, really talented
cultivator and he's an extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledgeable person in the history of
cannabis consumption, all the devices and
[SPEAKER_02]: the gear and the details and the history.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a fucking true cannabis aficionado.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a ganjie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so getting to work with him as the
managing partner was killer because it
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed there to be a genuine nature of we
want to help the small person out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it has to be fair because at the end
of the day, you can't favor them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But typically when you create programs,
the small farmer is actually excluded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case he was the focus and the
bigger farmer wasn't excluded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it changed the focus on quality,
not scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it did is it allowed a lot of the
people that came through.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I say is the impact of the ganjie is
there's over $2 billion in cannabis sold
[SPEAKER_02]: around the world under ganjie graduates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people that have come through the
program, I mean, name a big business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their lead buyers have come through,
their teams have come through,
[SPEAKER_02]: international teams, because at the end of
the day, they started to really understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that they needed a more in-depth education
on what is the quality of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: they weren't getting it from inside their
own business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having it focused in Humboldt County
allows us to be able to showcase many
[SPEAKER_02]: small farms, many craft operators,
and it allows people to be able to see
[SPEAKER_02]: different levels of production and the
quality that results from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the byproduct of that is it started to
create the desire for some of these larger
[SPEAKER_02]: companies to create better relationships
with the small farmers around them because
[SPEAKER_02]: they started to understand that when
you're constrained by investment on a
[SPEAKER_02]: brand, the only way you can bring in new
product outside of your line that fits
[SPEAKER_02]: your 62-day cycle, your mandate,
it to follow is to do it in collaboration
[SPEAKER_02]: with the small farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you do is you get to work on these
projects and every project that was set up
[SPEAKER_02]: worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that we helped them understand
functioned for the business and the
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farmer got paid, the business got
paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you start getting people to make
money, they'll listen to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to like me, but if I
steered you into a wealth, you'll listen
[SPEAKER_02]: to me pretty much when the phone rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we try to do here was we
try to help the people that came through
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that this is the world of
cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because you have so many diverse
people that you can function with within
[SPEAKER_02]: the Gange, it should help you really be
able to refine your direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people are, I noticed burned out
in their jobs and they're brilliant and
[SPEAKER_02]: successful, but they really don't feel
positive about their day-to-day job and
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to get into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gange helps them get an education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it also lets them get part of a
group and start to understand better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I fit in?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I make the best choices?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just, I think it's the best
part of the Gange is the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't expect it to be so kind and
supportive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I figured that we put this
program together, we're going to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: cool people coming through and the end
result will be really positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't expect to see how many
people wanted to come in and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain the relationships between the
students, the support groups, the help
[SPEAKER_02]: groups, the study groups, the networking,
the affiliations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a woman named Elizabeth Sage who
put together a student group that in life,
[SPEAKER_02]: if one could have a student like Liz Sage
come through your world, you'd be grateful
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're masters of connection and
coordination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come through and they become very
impressed with the program and they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I feel so good about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to bring my talent into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next thing you know, you're having
rivers of people getting together to work
[SPEAKER_02]: together, practice, refine and develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then that's, it's really a beautiful
program for me as an instructor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's humbling to be able to be in the
presence of so many beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not some corny shit,
but it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just never, I never get tired of the
students.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's a gift to be able to
have them come through Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a incredible experience because
so many of them are so incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: intelligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're getting people that are
brilliant in their respective worlds and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're coming in, if your game's not on
point, it won't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, it forces us as the instructors to
stay on top of what's taking place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to always make sure that we're
refining what we're doing and developing
[SPEAKER_02]: along with the program and acknowledging
that, you know, we're only us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way, what people understand is
that there really is no top to this
[SPEAKER_02]: ladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't even scratched the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us know where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, that humility allows
people to be able to approach it from a
[SPEAKER_02]: much, much more, like say gentle
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome that you feel such a deep
connection to it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And great to hear some of the inner
workings behind how it all goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, this is like a sort
of a personal curiosity, but I think your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with the program will help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that I was personally able to get
really deeply passionate about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started to develop a bit of a
palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as time's gone by, I've started
to wonder, sometimes I feel like I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure whether you develop a palette over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whether some people are just inclined
to sort of have it and others,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may never really come into the same
degree as certain other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel that you can get better at
picking up on the nuance of things over
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it sort of a bit more random and
universal, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you have to have the olfactory
senses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, like my father, for example,
has no sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my dad, you know, you could smoke weed
in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: My father wouldn't know because he
couldn't smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could see the smoke, but he couldn't
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people like that, well,
they'll never be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it also impacted his taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: So food didn't have the same flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things just were very bland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone like that, well, you're kind of
stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with most, it's about exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I did is I really took a look
at people who use their olfactory
[SPEAKER_02]: abilities to a high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would say, people from perfume,
people from wine, and the people who were
[SPEAKER_02]: best at it, the ones that they really
consider like prodigies, all of them have
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing in common.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all came from an area where there was
an incredible amount of diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: scent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they weren't from urban environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were from the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were able to pick up all the
nuances that impact the thing that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you do is you start to teach
yourself how to identify odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a good way to highlight this is that
when gas was red hot, there was a fuel
[SPEAKER_02]: depot near my shop and my friend was the
manager of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would go over there after work
and I could go and sniff all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: types of petroleum products, gear,
oil, kerosene, diesel, gasoline cut with
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol, race fuel, JP5 if they had jet
fuel barrels coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what it did is it let me develop this
incredible knowledge of petroleum odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that when I was looking at plants,
I would be able to say, okay, it's gas,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what kind of gas?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started to notice certain
preferences in the public for certain
[SPEAKER_02]: types of gas in certain places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you start to see these patterns of
consumption and what people choose and
[SPEAKER_02]: what they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by me spending time at the fuel depot,
sniffing fuel, I was able to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I needed to get a development in
fruit and floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go into fruit stands and I go into
spice shops and I just go through and
[SPEAKER_02]: spend an hour just smelling and looking at
the product and sniffing it and just
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to start to understand the
differences between some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I have an ability to recognize it
and at least say, hey, this has an odor of
[SPEAKER_02]: cardamom.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more like cedar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that when someone smells it,
you can say to them, what do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say, I like woody things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, woody like oak or woody
like cedar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like cedar better than oak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what we're doing is we're steering
people into their desires by using readily
[SPEAKER_02]: available terms that we can produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the only way that you can really
develop this is through practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you start to be able to pick
up is their terroir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the terroir is different than the
French because theirs is so much,
[SPEAKER_02]: or Italians in grape form because the
grape was developed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us in Humboldt County,
our air quality and our water quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbiome that's floating around the
plant itself because of the forest,
[SPEAKER_02]: impacts a flavor that when people come
from out of the area and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: evaluating, we've just noticed over a
thousand people, the flavor of Humboldt is
[SPEAKER_02]: what comes out all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know this plant, but this flavor is
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they describe it, we realize,
wow, that's the flavor of Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the impact of the air, the biology
and the water shaping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the ability for them to come
and see that allows them to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that they can also have regional impact in
their locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we were in Pakistan, Afghanistan,
India, we'd be able to say, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have true terroir because the plant was
here before we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we showed up 1500 years ago in the
Valley, the plants were already here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now that plant expresses itself
fully in that environment because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the natural relationship that occurred
that now allows you to be able to take
[SPEAKER_02]: that and market it correctly so that
people say, oh, I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked it, but the only place I
can get that is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the ability for you to say,
these are the flavors that you should
[SPEAKER_02]: find.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the odors that we noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the high, you describe how it
affects you, but that's one that's pretty,
[SPEAKER_02]: I say we're not snowflakes, but we would
say that everyone has their own edge on
[SPEAKER_02]: how things affect, but we can at least
talk about the delivery and how it
[SPEAKER_02]: affected you and then the drop off
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: But being able to do that is just,
it's an incredible feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it gets, it's kind of fun to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to go to your friend's house and
smell the spice drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool to go to a, I like to look in
the solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to like earthy related stuff where I
want to go smell different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: leather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go to the leather shop and then you
go and you go through the backyard and you
[SPEAKER_02]: look for all the decaying wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: You move the leaves and you smell the
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go into tobacco and you start to,
you start to get an idea of different
[SPEAKER_02]: aging of tobacco, kind of like tea,
the fermentation of it changes the scent
[SPEAKER_02]: profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those things impact what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think those are the things that
they're the most fun with cannabis because
[SPEAKER_02]: you can do them with people that don't
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely, hugely the most fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, as you just ran through,
you know, the, the myriad of different
[SPEAKER_00]: smells that I just had so many memories
come to mind and you, you get taken back
[SPEAKER_00]: with certain smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're on the topic of smells and
flavors, one of our listeners wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask specifically, can you give us a bit of
your breakdown on your different flavors?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they'd heard that you've got
your fuel fruit, floral earth sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you, can you give us some more info?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, what I noticed was I had just noticed
a pattern that when I was quantifying
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and libraries, like where do you
place them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you know, I can basically put any
plant I find in one of four categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was earth, fruit, fuel,
and floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuel at the time was chemical because
chemicals solvent and fuel go together to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I used to call it chemical until gas
really came on heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It let me have like very different
profiles in my libraries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, it allowed me to build nerves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allowed me to build adversaries for
people that gave them diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started to notice who consumed those
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started to see patterns of
consumption based off of those odor
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the years go by, it's a tool that I
use frequently and we get into the golden
[SPEAKER_02]: tarp era.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I create the golden tarp judging,
I said, Hey, let's use a lab to do our
[SPEAKER_02]: analytics so that we can neck down the cup
to 16 instead of 250.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we don't put it in categories,
it'll be a numbers cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me use the categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that'll do is that'll let us have
the, the four best of each category go
[SPEAKER_02]: against each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each one of those categories will be
combined metabolites and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what it did is it allowed us to
have 32% THC fuels going head to head with
[SPEAKER_02]: 11% earths.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it allowed me to get a really good
diversified numbers cup in a way that the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators could understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what allowed that cup to be so
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I create the judging criteria before
I actually start the cup and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but what it did was it gave me this
massive data set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the, like the fourth year of the
cup, I have a scientist from UCLA come and
[SPEAKER_02]: speak to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and there's, there's some other work
I'm doing simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we'll say that in the fourth year
of the cup, I have a scientist come and
[SPEAKER_02]: speak to me about my data sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was happening in the interim was DNA
hadn't come out yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you didn't really have,
when I first came up with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't have an ability to map from
DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I did is I said, can I map by
secondary metabolite profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I map by the volatile profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and hired some scientists and
PhD scientists from the local university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went on a project to figure out,
could we map cannabis by its secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolite profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: And after diving down that rabbit hole and
spending the money as the person funding
[SPEAKER_02]: the project, I realized that we couldn't
because they were too variable and that
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes were only a very small portion of
how we perceive the total.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was these styols and these esters
and these volatile sulfurs and ketones and
[SPEAKER_02]: all these other components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the scientist said, you're,
you're, you're the way you're doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: right now works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just perception by odor in the four
categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I already had scientists from the
university I'm working with trying to map.
[SPEAKER_02]: We failed in the mapping, but it
substantiated better why my system worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I felt comfortable with it as a tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when, when a scientist named John
Abrams approached me, he was a,
[SPEAKER_02]: he still is, he's a brilliant scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, at the time he was involved with
UCLA university of California,
[SPEAKER_02]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he approaches me and he says,
Hey, I'd love to look at the data on your
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to, you know, take a look at your
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know that he was working on
his own scent categorization as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was coming to look at mine and
he was challenging mine because I'm not a
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I come up with this at the time was
revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one, no one broke, can't still have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's broken down to this degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, well, check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I feel pretty comfortable with it
as a tool, but I don't have any real proof
[SPEAKER_02]: that everything fits into this because we
really don't have the tools, but I'll give
[SPEAKER_02]: you all the data from four years of
competitions and you can take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can take a look at it back at
the university with your team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then he drives down and meets me at
an event in Carpinteria that I'm working
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, Kev, he goes, you got to see
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He drove all the way to Carpinteria to
talk to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he unrolled the documents and he's
like, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, we've been working on this for
years and we couldn't figure this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they didn't understand was they,
they were able to say that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly see a floral cluster.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could clearly see a fuel cluster.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could see clearly see a fruit
cluster, but earth to them was degraded
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because the numbers were low and
the measurable metabolites were low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they didn't understand because
they weren't growers was that those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: produce less metabolites that we measure,
not in total, because we're not measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: the total package, but in measurable
under, under the current level of lab
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the plants produce those because they
don't need to produce anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The metabolites are produced as a stress
response.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're produced either track to repel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea that something like gorilla
glue, which we would call earthy or Bubba
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush as faulty is completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that they couldn't mentally wrap
their heads around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to say, Hey, this is how
you have to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what I had really discovered was
that if we look at the earth, the earth,
[SPEAKER_02]: the latitude is dictating these profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so zero to 25, you're really into the
floral fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 25 to 40, you start going into earth
and gases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And gas is a primary earth to subset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Floral is a primary fruit to subset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it's based off of is location on
the latitude that said these plants can
[SPEAKER_02]: only exist here if they have these
profiles due to, due to necessity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people steered the outcome by
selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started to be able to say,
look, if we look at floral profiles,
[SPEAKER_02]: we should be able to say, that people who
want uplifting cannabis will buy that
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started doing the data analysis,
what was the number one seller in any tech
[SPEAKER_02]: area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Floral varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you start to be able to quickly
say, okay, people on the equator to 25 had
[SPEAKER_02]: abundant food, abundant water,
plenty of plenty of living conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does all the thought provoking drugs
come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: There.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not worrying about trying
to survive a brutal winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do the narcotics come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 to 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is that for those individuals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're having to deal with very
hard life, less water, less food,
[SPEAKER_02]: high mountain deserts, you know,
10 inches of rain, freezing cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to be able to be narcotically
the dated through the cold winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the very thing you do is difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the region latitude dictates the
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people steer the populations to fit
what they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what it does, it allows us to be
able to say, where do gas profiles sell
[SPEAKER_02]: most?
[SPEAKER_02]: People who want to get most high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about fruit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lighter, brighter, high, newer users.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruit was never that popular really until
vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once vape comes in, everybody wants fruit
because they're hitting the vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did a shitload of tobacco
research so I could understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns of consumption that the tobacco
company is had figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just overlaid all of this over
all my own research and my own intuition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out comes this, this four categories
of perception that just kill it because
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually really do work well because
I didn't really invent anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw the patterns and I put all the
pieces together in synthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So invention to me is, you know,
came out of thin air with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had seen the pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recognized that these things from these
places had these effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it couldn't be random.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew that if I looked at as many
plants as I had seen over the course of my
[SPEAKER_02]: life, there wasn't any of them that I
couldn't put in one of those categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just created this really
powerful, simple tool that when we started
[SPEAKER_02]: using with a data collection, it worked
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the data from the
United States, specifically California,
[SPEAKER_02]: California goes into medical data from
2000 to 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from 96 to say 2018, you got 22 years,
22 years of data from the largest medical
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation provider in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can imagine the size of that data set.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you find is 95% of the people came in
to those offices to get a recommendation
[SPEAKER_02]: for one of four issues, sleep,
pain, appetite, or mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can lay each one of those into a
category cleanly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's these weird anomalies where
you just see these clusters of patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you really start to step back and
look at it, you go, wow, it's that simple
[SPEAKER_02]: because cannabis isn't multiple species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a single species that was dispersed
around the earth and spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know from what we know the history
that we know is that cannabis comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mongolia, plains of the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: It moves down into Asia, sits around for a
couple thousand years, shifts into Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: shifts down, goes into Africa,
goes into the Americas five or 600 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, moves up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the last ones really to have it,
North Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're the least familiar with the
product, but we're 80% of the world's herb
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really take a look at the
pattern, it lays out really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the scientists started to really
attack it, and then prove it right,
[SPEAKER_02]: they adopted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Abrams adopts it as a tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brings it forth through the Emerald
Scientific Conference, which he's the
[SPEAKER_02]: chair of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get introduced as the person who found
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What really kind of laid it in place was
there was a guy named Dr. Nasha who's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing brainwave analysis of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, if you consume different
types of cannabis, we should get a
[SPEAKER_02]: different brainwave readout.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was his hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he goes and buys different kinds of
cannabis, has people smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have the same exact result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, wow, all herb is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Abrams reads the study and says,
no, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did the experiment wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nasha's like, no, I did everything
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the store and I bought four
different kinds of cannabis, different
[SPEAKER_02]: names, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, no, no, let me provide the
cannabis based off of these categories and
[SPEAKER_02]: let's redo the experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they did, bam, four radically
different brainwaves appeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been substantiated enough times
and then it's been used over and over and
[SPEAKER_02]: over again by companies all over the world
that reached out to me privately and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, we heard about the categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we use them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tool that I'd love to see people
use because it makes it easy to really
[SPEAKER_02]: neck down these massive populations and
understand the demographics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who buys earth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Older people typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's buying floral?
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are in tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's buying fuel?
[SPEAKER_02]: People who want to get really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: People who want pain relief, appetite,
and people who are on a budget because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can consume less fuel and be high longer,
more because of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't get higher, but you have more
cannabinoids circulating in your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should stay high longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a price function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people that are poorer almost always go
to fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare that you go into a store with
less money and say, I want to enjoy the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, no, I want to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really sort of keen observation I
hadn't heard sort of articulated before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about it sort of makes sense
as far as I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go, guys.
