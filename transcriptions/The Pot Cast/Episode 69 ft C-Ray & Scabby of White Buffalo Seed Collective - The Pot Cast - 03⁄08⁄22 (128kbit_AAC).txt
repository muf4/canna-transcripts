[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much to C-Ray and Scabby of
White Buffalo Seeds for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, hey everyone, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question we love to ask all our
guests, what are you guys been smoking on
[SPEAKER_02]: today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're just generally smoking some
stuff that we just grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just testing out some of our new
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is Irene Cross Original Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another one is the Congolese Cross
Iraqi Pilgrim.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some other stuff that we just
harvested, like Angola Red.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else have you been smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just rolled up Angola Red and Irene Haze
and I was peeking a little bit there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're coming into the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're flying in the land raid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am thoroughly jealous right now because
as someone who loves sativas, but like
[SPEAKER_02]: most people doesn't have a ton of them
hanging around to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like exactly where I want to
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm probably going to ask you a
bunch of questions about all those
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties because they all sound great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the first one would be the Irene
Cushion Cross the Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's more leaning to the
haze side, is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's pretty balanced, I would say,
because apparently the Irene is a
[SPEAKER_03]: self-progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So self-progenies in crosses tend to be
reasonably consistent in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that one actually turned out
really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as far as uniformity from plant to
plant to plant, we grew about 16 females,
[SPEAKER_03]: so pretty good sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we ended up keeping about probably a
dozen of them to check out again,
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to ask you some more
questions about your feno hunting,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just to confirm for everyone
listening, are we talking about the Irene
[SPEAKER_02]: OG or a different Irene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if it's an OG per se,
but it's a OG-ish plant, but it's like a
[SPEAKER_03]: Cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have the weird buds growing from
the internode?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only grown it once, like twice,
and I didn't experience that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you mean like little budlets that grow
off the stem, the stem or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just heard people saying that you get
like these weird little buds growing at
[SPEAKER_02]: the internodes on Irene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious if you'd experienced
that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's like a phosphorus thing,
if I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, like potassium, high potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow buds right off the stalk if
you hit them with the right type of
[SPEAKER_03]: potassium at the right time, apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some cool info I wasn't aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it about the Irene that drew it
to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think if we look at your work,
there's often sort of an older world
[SPEAKER_02]: strain and sometimes a newer world strain,
and I'd be interested in hearing like what
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of characteristics of the modern
strain attract you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I haven't seen you grow a
cookies hybrid, but the Irene is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: modern.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's, I mean, we've only grown it a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those things you grow it
and you like, you taste it and it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely the turf beans are what
is most interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got a good high, like for being
we're kind of critical about more of the
[SPEAKER_03]: indica, commercial indica type stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that we're, because we're really like,
we're really sativa connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want, we want to, we expect all our
plants to have like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: some, some sort of profound, profundity in
the, in the stone, you know, like that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're, that's what our goal is,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this, the Irene's actually got a little
bit of a got a decent, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy, heavy effect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an easy man high, you know,
after you get up the little rocket boost
[SPEAKER_00]: there for a minute or two, and then it's
nice and easy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're grooving down the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the sounds of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, just based on hearing
that I'm confident it's the, the Irene cut
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of, because that's what
everyone says though, like above all,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the high on this plant is exquisite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the bud, bud shape is like,
not very like alluring to most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Iraqi kind of step,
or sorry, the Hayes kind of step that up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit across for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, beautiful stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, while we're on the topic of
Hayes, I had a few different questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'd be interested in asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you guys have worked with many
different Hayes over the years,
[SPEAKER_02]: both, you know, some of Neville's work
with like the Hayes A and Hayes C progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you guys have even worked with
some of the original stuff from Sam
[SPEAKER_02]: himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be interested to hear, like,
does that all check out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there one sort of stock of Hayes
that you think is better to the other,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's all just like a family?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as far as I'm concerned,
it all came from a Skunkman stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, what everyone's growing,
you know, there's obviously stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: people say predates that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, what everyone refers to as
original Hayes came through the Seedsman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think he sold a bunch, like
privately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunkman sold a bunch of seeds privately
before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of this stuff came through the
Seedsman, Seedsman company, seed company,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you look, if you go into archive
.org and look up Seedsman.com,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then go back to, it's like,
I don't know, it's like a couple of years
[SPEAKER_03]: after the earliest entries, you'll see the
original release of the seed, like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunkman's, you know, breed that he did at
that time, which is like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: original Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was some, a few land races,
and then there was a bunch of crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was, I think, some Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Indian, Afghani, Durban,
Kerala.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's probably more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, you'll find it on archive.org.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty interesting to go back and
look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you say Seedsman, are you talking
about like the generic label that the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank offers or like Sam's?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, I'm talking, the original,
like the seed bank, Seedsman, I believe,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I don't know the story, but I've
heard, you know, bits of the story that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was like a collab between, either it was a
collab or it was started with,
[SPEAKER_03]: basically it was started with Skunkman
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's what got it going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had like a kilo, he had like,
that guy bought like a kilo of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: different varieties, I think is the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think it lasted very long,
because if you look at archive.org,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can kind of see where like,
it was like a couple of years of Skunkman
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, and then it kind of transitioned to
Dutch, a bunch of Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think I remembered hearing that story
from Todd.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that all sort of checks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be interested to hear, in terms of
your experience with the Hayes,
[SPEAKER_02]: have you seen stuff come out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is similar to some of the well-known
stuff, like, you know, the, the black
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuban Hayes, you know, really famous NL5
Hayes cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever see any of the characteristics
in the Hayes you've worked with that seems
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to the other famous Hayes work,
or it all seems like quite unique?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, every, like we've grown the original
Hayes stock from a few different sources
[SPEAKER_03]: now, like four or five different sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every one you dip into is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all depends on, because everyone
started with a little, a small sub,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a sub selection of original
Hayes, you know, they got 10 seeds or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So based on luck of the draw, you know,
everyone got a little bit, and then they
[SPEAKER_03]: selected, you know, certain things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there, there's quite a bit of variation
in our experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like most of them are, most of them
are not worth growing in our opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you really have to find the right bag
of seeds and to get the, to get the really
[SPEAKER_03]: good ones that are worth growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most of them, like 99% of them,
most people would not want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it sort of parlays into the next
part of the question that I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask, which was that the impression I
always got from the work that came from
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville's Hayes stuff was that although he
got like a small number of seeds or males
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever it was from Sam, it seemed
like the males he got ended up being
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty bloody good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like your perspective on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, I mean, I haven't grown,
I've grown a few of Neville's things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, I mean, obviously they were
good because they stood the test of time
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're, and we grow, we grow some of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we have some NL Hayes seeds that are
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't, I don't know if like,
like I don't really know, um, the
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference between the A and the C
males is because we've grown a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we haven't grown the C5 or the A5
cutting, but we've grown C5 F2s and we've
[SPEAKER_03]: grown the A5.
[SPEAKER_03]: BX from Karma, BX1, I guess it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, we have a rough idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's definitely, uh, they're
definitely very different males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the A5 is really savory, um,
and kind of charcoal-y.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I get out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like charcoal and like, uh, woody incense,
whereas the, uh, the C5 side is,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, sweet, um, flowery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like perfumey or pencil shavings on the
C5.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That checks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, I've been lucky enough to try both
of those and your descriptions fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly fit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've smoked, I smoked a bunch of the stuff
without, uh, of like a bunch of Hayes,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what they call Hayes in, um,
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I probably have smoked both of
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was there, because I was smoking
stuff from like, uh, uh, Neville's buddy,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, uh, Steve, um, he had some,
something, something, uh, and a bunch and
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of dispensaries at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume some of them had the real deal,
you know, like real deal, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, that they were just marketing as NL
Hayes at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't confirm without going back in a
time machine, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, out of curiosity, I've always
found that people tend to fall on one side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're either like, I love the Hayes C or
I love the Hayes A and notably a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the breeders I speak to, they all say the
Hayes A they're like, yeah, that Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I myself, I love the Hayes C that
more Thai floral sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have one you fall more preference
wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm in the C side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like both qualities, but yeah,
C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, you know, the, the BC,
uh, sweet scum cutting the breeder Steve
[SPEAKER_03]: cut, um, that one is very C five dominant,
very C five dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like after growing those C five F twos and
then like revisiting that cutting,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really obvious that like originally
when the sweet skunk was sold,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, by Mark Henry, um, he marketed as SMC
seeds, big skunk cross grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, the original story was that he,
uh, Steve got, uh, a tray of cuttings and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a male and they weren't like,
yeah, it ended up being males instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where that male came.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, they figured out, uh,
later on it was an anal Hayes male that
[SPEAKER_03]: made the sweet scum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's definitely the story
he told me and it checks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I sadly haven't been able to try sweet
skunk, but it looks like anal five Hayes,
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, it's very, uh, and all five
based on like, you'll like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have way better ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now as we've worked down the
lines, uh, in terms of qualities that are
[SPEAKER_00]: better for growing, like hardiness,
a powdery middle do ease of growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, it's definitely a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut your teeth on another, uh,
another plant we grew that was what I
[SPEAKER_03]: would, I think would be like the A5 is the
bandaid Hayes, uh, number seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your thoughts on that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's all right, but it's,
um, like we have better stuff in our
[SPEAKER_03]: collection that we like personally more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's, it's a good plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a newer Feno that I tried
that I liked way better, uh, to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bandaid Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friend, uh, down the road here,
he got a pack of 10 original bandaid
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: F1s I believe they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just grew that, like, he just grew
them out and, uh, he, he must've got two
[SPEAKER_03]: packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, maybe there was, it must've been
like more than a pack there or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, the number 12, uh, was really
nice, like better than for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was better than the number seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it was two, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it on a jar back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, that makes sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it must've been, um, two packs if it
was number 12 there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I've seen people posting,
did you know, did he give that out at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a, like a cutting that gets
passed around now.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he just, he just, uh, popped those,
uh, recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was more recent kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high on the new one is like very,
uh, you smoke it and then it's like very
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate up and you're like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it comes into a better
relaxed high, but I find it's a much
[SPEAKER_00]: better high than, than the 11 people junk
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be interested to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you mentioned that, uh, you said,
yeah, look, it's good, but we've got some
[SPEAKER_02]: better stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually looking at some Band-Aid
Hayes crosses going, is this the sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been searching for?
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you guys have got other
ones that might be more up my lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm looking for that racy sativa sort
of thing, what might be some
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations from your catalog for
someone like me who wants that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we really tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we really sample everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really go by the highs and the smells,
you know, that sort of, those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we really go by and we smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, that's something that we
really try to, you know, involve in
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, personally, I enjoy the Columbia or
the Angola red, uh, Columbia and black
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those were really awesome,
but you find it in lots of different stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have, you know, various pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything we have is, uh, been well
tested and, uh, like we've gone through
[SPEAKER_03]: and made sure that it was, um,
up to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's basically what we're looking
for in, in a smoke and, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I know our listeners are going to
heckle me if I don't get some more sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor friendly ones out of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, like for someone who's, cause that's
the complaint I hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm, I'm like you guys, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm trying to get people to grow
sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they always say, you know,
it's, I'm growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have something that's like quite
indoor friendly or manageable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, we have a Congolese cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Iraqi is actually a sativa Dom,
but, uh, it's very manageable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our, um, Iraqi pilgrim, we grew out three
packs, so like 36 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, there was two males in there that
were semi-auto.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, uh, there's a few more that were
semi-auto, but there was two good
[SPEAKER_03]: semi-auto males that I specifically used
in the pollination of those crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're very, uh, like they're a lot
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I kicked down on everything for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, passed on Uber good qualities to
everything it touches a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Congo clone is really easy for a
sativa, you know, nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it satisfies most of the guys who are,
you know, looking for something newer to
[SPEAKER_00]: try.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not so, so low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The count, the Congolese is a very good,
um, commercial plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the, most of the guys that
grow it commercially, they cut it at nine
[SPEAKER_03]: or 10 weeks, even though you can like,
there's a whole range of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can cut it early, uh, or you can let
it go a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it is, it's actually better turp
wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the early part, like most people would
prefer it as nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it has, uh, as more of the,
uh, lemon peel turps at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to the Congo later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, uh, I love that cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I just want to loop back quickly
to the hierarchy pilgrim stuff you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, you mentioned, um, that it was
semi-auto flowering is, do you mean that
[SPEAKER_02]: in sort of the way that some, like,
I know that for example, blueberry is a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit like that, where it's like,
once it gets root bound, it just tries to
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that sort of what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you mean like in a true sense,
it's a bit auto flowery?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I have a very basic definition of
semi-auto.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's semi-auto is something that,
that triggers and that it'll start
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering, but you can re-veg it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's auto, basically you can't
re-veg it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, you can re-veg auto stuff like
with a bunch of techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but semi-auto like semi-auto,
you can re-veg with, uh, like pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: normal techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time and size of bucket, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, or just take cuttings,
re-veg cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like sort of what I was
thinking, like just, I guess some strains
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm familiar with fall under that
category.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just call them a bit temperamental,
but worth keeping around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, the, uh, that the Iraqi pilgrim
is, uh, it's what I would call a pseudo
[SPEAKER_03]: land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not even really a pseudo land
race, but it could be a pseudo land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause if you look at the description for
it on seed heaven, um, the, the guy that
[SPEAKER_03]: collected the seeds, he just, he went on a
tour of Iraq and, uh, he just collected
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from everywhere that, that was,
that were good and put them in a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, it's got a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, when we grew them, um,
most of them weren't, they were,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're okay, but most of them were not
things we would grow again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, unfortunately we found a good female
and a good male and, and the rest is
[SPEAKER_03]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we made F2s out of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got what we needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to specifically ask,
I noticed on the website that you did F2
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was wondering, was that just to have
like a bigger pool to select from,
[SPEAKER_02]: or was there like a specific reason you
did that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was because it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the main reason to make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you come across something good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, maybe I should be more specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there, was there a reason you didn't
just use like an F1 male and you went for
[SPEAKER_02]: the F2 male instead?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the more inbred something is,
the more, uh, you're able to predict what
[SPEAKER_03]: the outcome is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm always trying to, you know,
increase the predictability in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the hybridization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my goal is always to, um, if I have a
choice between a inbred male and a not
[SPEAKER_03]: inbred male, I'm always going to choose
the inbred male, unless there's some
[SPEAKER_03]: specific reason that, uh, you know,
want to choose the other one, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's always preferable to, um,
the male side of, of your hybrid equation
[SPEAKER_03]: is always the one that has the most
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I like to use something that's
inbred cause then we have like,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can you know, if we have something
that's inbred, if we've grown it before,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, and it's relatively consistent from
plant to plant, then we have like an idea
[SPEAKER_03]: of what that male is going to be like more
of an idea basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess one of the sentiments you hear
commonly expressed when people are talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about using inbred males is that the more
inbred a line is, the more it tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: dominate the cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that to be the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more like what you just said
before where it's just more predictable,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not necessarily dominating?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it depends on what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends on what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like some things that are like that
are a blueberry blueberries super dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: in hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry vision was very,
when we grew that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the dominance like kicking
down halfway or more all the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: something I didn't like preferably,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a dumb one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, um, some things are, are not
non-dominant and actually, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: for breeding, sometimes you want a
non-dominant male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because like, let's say you're doing,
uh, a shotgun breed where you have a male
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're bringing in, you're loading
your room up with, uh, everything that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can get your hands on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, uh, by having a non-dominant male,
then you, you're allowing all those other
[SPEAKER_03]: things to express themselves in the
hybrids and you're not ending up with a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, really similar or more
similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's such a valid and valuable
point because I always try to say to
[SPEAKER_02]: people, I think probably upwards of 90% of
the time when the average person buys a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed, they're buying it for the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they want that clone only sort of
mother, like most of the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course there's some variation,
but that's, and that's why what you just
[SPEAKER_02]: said is perfect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you've got a father that just
allows the mom to shine through,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can give people sort of the clone
only that they can't get their hands on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's, that's a tricky question
because clone onlys are often like poly
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just weird things that are not
going to ever pop up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like sweet skunk, the plant we were
talking about, for instance, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've tried breeding with that so many
times and, uh, what comes out of it is
[SPEAKER_03]: never as good as the original cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've just eliminated that from our
breeding program at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, completely a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's really interesting to
hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that ultimately you,
you refine your females you work with over
[SPEAKER_02]: the years to be ones that work well in the
breeding sense, not just like it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: popular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's where we're always looking
for stuff that, um, works well as
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, like in hybridization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like a good trait in a hybrid,
in a, you know, in hybridization is a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that the hybrids are better than the
original.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one plant that, uh, is like that is
very reliable like that for us is the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the grapefruit cutting, the BC grapefruit
cutting, pretty much anything that you put
[SPEAKER_03]: onto it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if it's, you know, half decent,
you'll end up with something cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be more fun to grow than,
than the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you find the grapefruit is in
general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously it's like this popular
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you think that the smoke itself is
good or it's more what you said that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it's a good tool for the next step?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, uh, like it's not, uh, super,
um, potent or anything, but it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's the kind of weed that a lot of
people like to smoke because it's just,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like savor weed, you know,
weed that you just smoke to savor it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like super potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, from what there's a lot of
people that they don't want to get whacked
[SPEAKER_03]: out of their head.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they just want to smoke
something that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a bit of a relaxing high to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it yields well to use the other
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really big yelder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they, they used to harvest it at six
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I used to be skeptical of the
49 day Cindy 99, but you got that beat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wasn't, it wasn't necessarily,
you know, our South Asian brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's the same in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, out of curiosity, I, I've spoken to
Steve in the past and I said, what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think grapefruit was?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, I think it's just an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and are you friends with Steve?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I noticed you had the grapefruit cut
and I was like, I don't think even he has
[SPEAKER_02]: it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, my opinion is it's an NL hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known Steve a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a real good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but he's brought lots to the table
over the years and, uh, he loves to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that big boom in boys and people
like to listen to, you know, that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: best description of his voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it very booming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the grandfathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like in the grandfather category for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to link back for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about the hierarchy
Pilgrim and you answered this in the
[SPEAKER_02]: question that I think you sort of said you
got it off a website, but our listeners
[SPEAKER_02]: are always curious to know where do you
source your land race seed from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it always sort of just haphazard or is
it, do you have like a go-to method of
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get new stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, or is it just sort of opportunistic?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is just random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very random.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, some of the, like, I, I actually like,
uh, buying seeds personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I see a land races on,
on, um, uh, the real seed company,
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to buy a lot of stuff from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, like everything I buy,
I'll buy three packs minimum, because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's so much variation in that stuff,
um, that you really need.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really need to dig through multiple
packs to find stuff that, uh, like to get
[SPEAKER_03]: a really good idea of what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and to figure out what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or you either that, or you're really
lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I like the real seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big fan of those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, like all the guys in India,
the Indian land race guys, I was just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to ask you beat me to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've got some stuff from them through
other people that other people have sent
[SPEAKER_03]: us, um, that we're going to be dipping
into at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and a lot of people like random
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, contact us and, uh, uh, trade us
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people from Angola, you know,
that have lived there just get ahold of
[SPEAKER_00]: us, see our stuff, you know, send us a
bunch of seeds to try and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, like lots of sharing back in the CW
days, you know, lots of sharing back then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lots, and some of our friends,
uh, have been traveling around and they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: bring back seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one of our friends was in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kenya.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, he took the last plane out before
they shut down, uh, like for COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had a bunch of seeds from,
he said, yeah, I got some seeds from some
[SPEAKER_03]: Rasta, um, in Kenya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's sort of the way
most breeders I speak to get their seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's sort of just like where you
can, you mentioned the Angola and we
[SPEAKER_02]: actually had a listener submitted question
and they were just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, what's the difference between
the two different Angolas you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one's the number 13, one's the
number 18 from memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, uh, well, smell and high for one
and, uh, varying rate of intersex traits,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you want to explain how they,
how, how, where they came from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, they, they came from,
they were sent to me from, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: La Mano Negro's collection, his wife,
Katarina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it was given to him from a guy
who, uh, sailed ships up the coast to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what was the name of that island?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Capo Verde.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capo Verde, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a sea captain from Capo Verde,
I guess, gave them the seeds and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: sent out to us after he passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and that guy was like,
uh, getting seeds at, uh, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, um, places where they were,
uh, like oil refineries going up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coast, you know, and just collecting
things that he had liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't like, he was just buying,
he'd buy weed and get the seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: coastal ports, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So he wasn't like, uh, you know,
in the bush sampling all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, most of it was like garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of it was garbage, very,
uh, heavily intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the 13 was more earthy pee kind
of smells I liked and very little intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, the 18 was more of a citrus
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had a higher citrus, like you get
that citrus out of the 13 too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like muted a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it stands out a little more in the
18.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just decided to keep both of
those smells around for future,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, is there a certain variety that
the, like the strength, the effect is
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to, like, you know, if you were to
say like, Oh, I feel like super silver
[SPEAKER_02]: haze, you'll like this obviously super
silver haze bad example, but you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, like I put it in a category
called the spiritual high, I guess not to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to like wavy gravy or anything,
but, uh, uh, different people have
[SPEAKER_00]: different experiences with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is definitely spiritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say in the way you can connect to
yourself, to that inner voice,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say that, that those, uh,
Angola's and like the Malawi's and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to have that really,
uh, up high that's introspective and
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly, you know, not too racy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always, we're looking for stuff
that's not necessarily racy, but more like
[SPEAKER_03]: a creative high, uh, a creative and like
positive, you know, opens up your heart
[SPEAKER_03]: chakra kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your heart chakra and your throat
chakra and your third eye chakra,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always felt like they're really
underrepresented sort of sativa most often
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I like, I think I probably haven't
thought about this enough, really,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I always sort of would tell my
friends, like, I feel like there's two
[SPEAKER_02]: types of sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like the, the one that annihilates
you and makes you paranoid and just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's like the real clear
headed one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of more like what you're
talking about where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not riddled with anxiety and you're
like actually upbeat and having a good
[SPEAKER_02]: time and feeling like, Hey, I'm really
connecting with this actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, definitely an underserved strain
in a sort of a type of strain in our
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think take terms of music up in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those are the kinds of things I look
forward to, you know, the beat that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to kind of takes it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to, um, I like to count the,
the number of different, uh, ringing
[SPEAKER_03]: sounds in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get more like more than two or
three different sounds, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're onto a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, I think scabby just mentioned
the Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I did want to ask you about that
quickly, just because you don't really see
[SPEAKER_02]: people outside of say like yourself and
maybe like ACE or cannobiogen really
[SPEAKER_02]: playing around with the Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd you get yours from?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would you describe it to people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like a haze or more like a different
sort of sativa?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it earthy African?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Africans, they're not like long
flowering sativa types.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like in the shorter, like 10,
12 range, you know, uh, so it's a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: manageable in terms of, uh, the timely
and, uh, yeah, you can find some really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting things in there,
but you've got to look through a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and make some F2s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, to further answer your question,
we got the seed from, uh, the Mano Negra.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same stock is what those guys use.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would send a big package when after he
passed that his wife made up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was, there, there still is a
bunch of, uh, his old stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've grown through quite a bit
of it, but, uh, yeah, he, he had a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good touch, you know, and he had with
plants and, uh, yeah, I definitely respect
[SPEAKER_00]: this collection and I'm glad that we can
share some things, you know, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's up there with that same
proven sort of stock that the other guys
[SPEAKER_02]: have played with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's, um, uh, what was that guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that was selling African seeds out
of the UK that passed away like seven
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago, um, Afro peps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Afro peps.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a Malawi as well, but I haven't
experienced that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, it's like all things,
um, when you get into those, those types
[SPEAKER_03]: of seeds, you have to grow a bunch of them
or be lucky to get the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to get the really experience what,
what it is you want to experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to get to find the really good
Malawi or, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're like a cash proper,
this is, that's not the kind of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're going to want to like,
uh, enjoy it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you're someone who loves
cannabis, these are important lessons to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn and important things to share and
pass on, you know, or do you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me back guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was, we might have to get two
independent stories here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, my first experience of wondering
what cannabis was, was, um, in the late
[SPEAKER_03]: eighties, um, I was in something called
the Navy league cadets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which was like, uh, basically like Cub
Scouts with a Navy theme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, I was in, uh, the band and,
uh, one of the officers one day we're up
[SPEAKER_03]: there, the band, we're up there with the
band and he's, for some reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's talking about hemp rope and he's,
and he said, uh, yeah, this hemp rope is,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, it's made of, made from the same plant
as marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he had this really goofy smile on
his face when he said it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my, uh, I was, I'm, I think I was like
10 or 11 years old and, um, just the way,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the way he said, this is like,
this is from the same plant as marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: and had this big smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I knew there was something,
something about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it wasn't, it wasn't until,
uh, I was in my, uh, like I w I'm,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of late to the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, basically when I was around,
uh, 19 or 20 is when I, is when I finally
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and actually the first few times I
smoked it, I was, it was, um, it was
[SPEAKER_03]: probably just the particular type of weed
that it just was not, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't, that wasn't for me,
but, um, uh, once I, once I, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: found like, I made a new friend,
um, who was a big pothead and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, he properly introduced it,
introduced me to it when I was about 21
[SPEAKER_03]: in, uh, in Vancouver, when I, when I moved
there for, uh, the second time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I was younger, I lived in a
fishing village on the East coast and we
[SPEAKER_00]: would get bricks of hash that would wash
up on the shore or out from the fishing
[SPEAKER_00]: book boats that from runners that would go
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would go up in our little camps in
the woods and get some hot knives going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, we do these saltwater hash dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, they were pretty gross now that I
look back on it and they used to call us
[SPEAKER_00]: animals and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, no, it was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, one of the first weeds I ever
really loved was, um, the guy that was on
[SPEAKER_00]: my Island had been growing for a long time
and he had been in breeding this Maui Waui
[SPEAKER_00]: that was finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would just get you fucking licked,
you know, and, uh, unfortunately he died
[SPEAKER_00]: in a car accident and I never got to,
as I got older, I never got to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from him, but, uh, I grew with them
a year or two and learned some things and
[SPEAKER_00]: he, he put me on my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was maybe 14 or 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, I knew that weed would be a
part of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, uh, you have the drinkers
and the weeders and as soon as you
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, um, some of those,
uh, awesome highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it would be a part of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got that sort of mentoring so early
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when you phrase is going to be
like, don't tell me you're heady unless
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done a hot water, hot knife.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those ones where it's
like, people will hear that and find it
[SPEAKER_02]: funny, but it's like, it would have given
you this type of high that you just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: experience anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like as well as the set and
setting, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were really close to Montreal too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you'd have a lot of different
hashes coming like the East coast of
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all hash, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys would go to work in the factories
and they buy their quarter ounce or half
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce of hash for the week and mix it with
their tobacco or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, weed wasn't really a big thing
on the East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came to the West coast,
you know, that's changed over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but that's just the smuggling routes,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like hash is hash was traditionally not
very popular in Western Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: except for places that you couldn't get
good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I grew up in the prairies and,
uh, there was like, I never saw weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I grew up, I only saw people doing
hot knives.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my only experience of like,
or I would, sometimes I would smell people
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking really rough, uh, joints on the
street, like, and wondering what,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I was, I would smell that stuff
and wondering what the heck was going on
[SPEAKER_03]: there because I didn't quite smell like a
cigarette, but I never really like where I
[SPEAKER_03]: grew up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I grew up with, uh, the, uh,
motor, like the, um, muscle car crowd.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't really big into smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were into, uh, heavy metal and,
uh, drinking booze more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd be interested to hear C Ray,
what was the moment that you realized
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it sounds like it wasn't till a bit
later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was the, the Eureka light bulb
turning on moment for you where you were
[SPEAKER_02]: like, this is what I got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, initially it was just,
I was working as a machinist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it was for me, initially it was
just the curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, I just started growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my first grow was under some step
under some stair, like a stairwell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made my own, uh, fluorescent,
uh, fixture with like six little two foot
[SPEAKER_03]: long fluorescent bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like two foot by two foot
square and maybe like two foot tall,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just hardly any space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, I was just more, I was more
curious with, uh, like I, I come from a
[SPEAKER_03]: line of farmers, um, on my mom's side of
the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm, I'm kind of like a gardener farmer
by nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just curious about growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that you can grow your own
was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it wasn't really until,
uh, until maybe like 90, 1998,
[SPEAKER_03]: I met a friend of mine who was,
I was going to, um, school learning
[SPEAKER_03]: machine, like, uh, tool and die.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was learning tool and die, uh,
the trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I ran like, uh, I was at the
school and they had this, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental kind of like, uh,
uh, one day environmental conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one guy was, uh, they're talking
about hemp and, uh, he just said,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, he had all sorts of
different things that you could make out
[SPEAKER_03]: of hemp and things that were made out of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, this kind of blew my mind at that
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Whoa, this is pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was, that was a, that was a
point where I was, I started, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, thinking about how it could be a
part of my life basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, that's like quite a unique
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think most people, including
myself, it's like after a really good hit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're at like a fair or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we were getting, we were getting high
the whole time too, but okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that adds to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That adds to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were some of the first strains you
guys were growing when you started
[SPEAKER_02]: growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And was this at the time when strains had
names or it was like just the kind or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super sativa seed club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like lots of that stuff was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Friesland, uh, the old, old Friesland
was some of the first stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my buddies, Maui, Waui,
and like, we would just order whatever we
[SPEAKER_00]: could off Mark Emery's site or whoever's,
you know, the Dutch scene, the gray area,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever, you know, uh, yeah, grew
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lots of different stuff, but that
Friesland really finished outdoor in the
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd see that a lot around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scabby grew up on the East coast and I
grew up on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our experiences are a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I got, I actually got to be,
I actually got to go into, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Emery's, uh, little grow shop and buy
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I knew all the varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a bit of a seed nerd at that time,
but the first seeds that I grew were sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk from Reader's Seed, uh, Spice of
Life seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were very, very different from
the select cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were, uh, very, a lot similar to a
lot more similar to Grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like Indica hybrids more or
less.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, um, I think the male that
got used in that cross, looking back was
[SPEAKER_03]: probably enough, possibly an F1 or it had
variation in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it was probably selected for
Indica traits, but it's spat out a little
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa phenol every so often because like
what I experienced, what I got out of it
[SPEAKER_03]: was, uh, very, um, thick kind of NL,
uh, like NL, uh, flavors, um, mixed with
[SPEAKER_03]: like savory thick NL flavors mixed with
the very citrusy Grapefruit flavors,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is pretty different than what the,
the, uh, Reader's Seed cutters like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did, did you get the cutting like
around that time or it was much later you
[SPEAKER_02]: got it and you were like, Oh, this is
pretty different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't grow it until the cutting until
the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't think that that cutting
didn't, uh, merge till later, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a later thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think the, I don't know if he told
the story, Reader's Seed told the story,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think, uh, something along the lines
of, they, they, it's like they,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, older, like it was some leftover
stocks that they, uh, Mark Henry had that
[SPEAKER_03]: they grew and found that particular
cutting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a story like one in 500 or
something, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a couple of things that's best
for Steve to like fill you in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I can't remember specifically,
but, um, um, I'm sure it was a special
[SPEAKER_02]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the cowboy, maybe something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a follow-up for you, Scabby,
I'd be interested to hear out of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: SSSC you grew, which was the one you
missed the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, honestly, that Friesland, uh,
was some of my favorite stuff ever because
[SPEAKER_00]: there was, uh, Fennels, like I've tried
Fennels now in the future, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and, uh, they, they just hit harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like something, I don't know
what the fuck happened, but something
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the stuff I'm getting nowadays,
the pink, uh, pink freeze and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, all the other cuts that are around,
they don't hit quite as hard as that old
[SPEAKER_00]: Friesland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was a very narcotic, uh,
buzz, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weed was, uh, so potent,
like it'd be drying in your house and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd like, I'm out of here, you know,
you can't even see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make you sick.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't know why it changed,
but something definitely happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you grew a bunch of that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew it in the future too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like in the future, like around two,
2003 and stuff, we got a bunch of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and 39 and 36, uh, and 38,
uh, and, uh, it was a reproduction stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I bet, but it was all very uniform and
the same, but no real punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original was probably an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's probably what was
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, like, yeah, that, that same time,
uh, when we first grew the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was that one by Steve?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first seed lot he had out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, uh, Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first seeds of Shishkeberry that we
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really powerful and beautiful
and everything I ever tried after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just didn't, didn't, uh, stand up to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I look back, that's probably what
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the F1.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you have certainly nailed
that Shishkeberry one on the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was either Steve or DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember which one, cause we've
spoken to them both in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said that it was like the mail
they use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone down and he like, they're like
fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who can quote this mail to it's like B one
five zero something, but it's got like a
[SPEAKER_02]: label and people know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, it made some
incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like that first Shishkeberry as
well as the other stuff when they were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that, when DJ and Steve were doing
that work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, uh, it's kind of impressive,
I guess that like your palette picked up
[SPEAKER_02]: on that on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that's one of the fun things
about weed is we're, uh, bioessaying all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff and we're building a little
computer in our brains, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, that's the real fun thing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have all these, uh, THC limits and
you know, this terpene and that terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to me, and I think the funnest thing
is just building your own library in your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, you know, and the, the smells,
the memories that the smells kick out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, that take you back or in
your atheric brain in my atheric brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving forward, what was the first
cross you guys made individually or
[SPEAKER_02]: together?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also want to know, tell me about the
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it intentional or was it like a happy
accident?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I, my original seeds that I ever made
were actually just sweet scone captus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the only reason I did it was to see
if I could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually, I don't, and I grew,
I grew actually grew some out,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like, I don't even, I don't even know
because I was so inexperienced at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of the stuff I was doing,
I was just, I would laugh and I would
[SPEAKER_03]: laugh my ass off at some of the shit I was
doing back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I was only, uh, 20 years old
or whatever, 21 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I, I was, uh, I kept to myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wasn't, um, like I wasn't in the
scene learning, uh, cannabis, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation techniques from other guys
that could have taught me some good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, uh, just reading gardening
books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I wasn't, I wasn't that serious
about it at that point, but I was,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, yeah, it was just a curiosity for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some of the first ones for me,
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would be like, uh, unintentional stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost we were doing a lot of gorilla
growing at the time I was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wilderness and, uh, like, uh, it was very
cold back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would come back in the springtime and
oh my God, I had some seeds that were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up, you know, from the old holes
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were some of the first crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were like inbred Maui,
Maui things that had been inbred for
[SPEAKER_00]: shortness over and over and over again in
the, in that season to get something to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a followup, what was the first
cross you did where as like, I guess it's
[SPEAKER_02]: what was the cross you did where you
looked at the end results and you were
[SPEAKER_02]: like, this is really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I need to sell this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, was that the first cross you
brought to market or was it just what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we came through a weird time,
like with prohibition and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we, it was like a war zone,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people were getting arrested
everywhere and going to jail and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it was just fun to make seeds and
share seeds and get it out there and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stick one up to the man kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I think it just grows into a
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you do it in your aptitude,
the more you get used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, he's really into gardening
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just, it's kind of a natural thing
that comes about I think for both of us
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't even honestly answer that
question to be honest, because I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was young and I was just so,
uh, so stoned from like anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that I can think about related to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just so stoned at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, there's such a difference
between, um, the reasons I was smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: weed for back then and like my experiences
of it back then and, uh, and now I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, in the present era.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, I was just, uh, I mean,
just doing like, just making a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: random stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, when, um, when I started
working with, uh, when I worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: Reefer Man, that's when, uh, like I made a
whole bunch of crosses and invariably some
[SPEAKER_03]: of that stuff worked out, even though I
was, you know, still not really fully
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding what I was doing,
learning on the job kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard many a people get such work
experience and I'd be interested to delve
[SPEAKER_02]: into that a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know that you got your start with a
sort of the Prairie Fire and Reefer Man
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what sort of genetics were you
working with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, as you sort of just alluded to,
were you aware of sort of the popularity
[SPEAKER_02]: the work was going to go on to receive,
or was it all quite a surprise to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, I didn't, like, I didn't really
know like Reefer Man or Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just met him randomly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was living on the sunshine coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just met him one day and he just,
we clicked and, uh, he said, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: come work with me and, uh, the rest is
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, uh, I was just a guy and I
knew a little bit about growing weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: making seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, enough to get by.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, he basically, you know,
set the agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, you know, like I, you know,
I, I hadn't, I was not part of that world
[SPEAKER_03]: of, of, uh, making seeds and selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I just, uh, just learned about
all that stuff on the job and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, figured things out,
uh, just through trial and error.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and eventually I'm, you know,
we would get feedback, uh, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: from the seeds and I'm somewhat,
somewhat of a good idea of what worked and
[SPEAKER_03]: what didn't work, but, uh, I didn't get to
grow out, you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know exactly what worked and
what didn't, but you can, uh, like get an
[SPEAKER_03]: idea of some stuff that works because
people are still growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, some things I know are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what sort of parents were you working
with and did any of them leave a lasting
[SPEAKER_02]: impression on you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you were like, oh, you know,
that tie was really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he had, uh, he had his own seeds and
he had some seeds from Steve Tuck,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, the heroin guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He traded a bunch of seeds with Steve
Tuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had some cool things from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got like Nepalese and, uh, a bunch of
random, he had a bunch of random IVLs.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had like cash plants, uh, Steve Tuck
that he traded with us, um, to Jackie
[SPEAKER_03]: Stoney.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uzbekistan, there's like four of those,
uh, Middle Eastern hash plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to grow some of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, a lot of it was, uh,
he was, uh, more commercially oriented,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, uh, like hash plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that era for me, the, like the
early BC days was, uh, it was all about
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial plants, like wood plants look
good in a bag, uh, smell good in a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yield really big.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, that was basically the,
like a lot of the plants that were mass
[SPEAKER_03]: produced at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was a plant called Romulan that
are like, uh, Joe Romulan that people are
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar with that, um, that, uh,
it, uh, it's not around anymore because it
[SPEAKER_03]: was not a fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, it made a lot of small buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was like a sit, like a sativa
frame, uh, with Indica little Indica buds
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it probably was pain in the ass to
trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and probably not, they probably just
not a good sea of green plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine based on the description that
I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, it wasn't like, like you see
a lot of, uh, Romulan stuff around and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, her friends that grew Romulan say
that, uh, like none of that stuff looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like the original Romulan, like the
original Romulan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original Romulan that they grew back
then was, um, little rock, rock hard buds
[SPEAKER_03]: that didn't get, uh, any bigger than a,
than a, like a jawbreaker, like really
[SPEAKER_03]: small round buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember getting the, uh,
like we bought some, some jars from Joe
[SPEAKER_03]: when he was bringing them into Vancouver
and they came in half size jars,
[SPEAKER_03]: what we call salmon jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ounces came in half size jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was super dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, uh, form form cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get it pretty dense too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it all fit in a smaller jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, it was really rock hard
stuff, but, um, where am I going with
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell like pine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pine and, and, uh, uh, meat really meaty
and kind of like, uh, curry, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: lemon, lemon curry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little bit jealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm there with you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to try it either,
but there's so many things we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to loop back on, but seeing as we're
talking about Romulan, let's, let's smash
[SPEAKER_02]: a few out of the park.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any idea or just any general
guesses as to what the genetics are?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's one that's so up in the air
and I just, I don't think, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of things we don't know
about, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like chem dog and OG, but like a lot of
those things, we have an idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with Romulan, I'm like, I just don't
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one that, uh, the story
went to bed with the last, like the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that have passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it seems like there's a lot,
like we've seen a lot of weird stories,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, come out of stuff that we know the
real story of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of those things where the
story is so ridiculous that I just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I don't, I'm highly
skeptical of the different stories out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Leafley says that Romulan is derived from
a Korean land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it could be, but, uh, like big,
big, uh, big skunk, big Korean skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was like Korean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they, they added in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way back in the sixties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they added in, well, that's the
story that started off with Korean and
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai and Colombian or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every so often they would add in some
stuff that was coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they added in, uh, uh,
Afghani in the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then they didn't, no, no,
that's not the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they added in more Colombian or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, apparently it came from Romulan.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the story we heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brace yourself came from a hydro store.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came from the original hydro store on
Vancouver Island in, uh, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was one of the original early hydro
stores in, uh, Port Albany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't know who called it Romulan,
but it was a plant that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Circulating in that, that community,
which is, uh, it's on the West coast of
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the population of Vancouver
Island lives on the East coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess it's a little bit off the
beaten track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe would have been working at this hydro
shop at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think the people who had Romulan
back in the day did have the real Romulan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Robbie about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a vision creator, uh, he grew lots of
it when he was living down there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city in the early days, you know,
he had a couple houses of it and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, they had cut houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the major cuts at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the era of pink cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's disappearing in front of our feet
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get bored and move on with stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Better stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was, uh, in back in those days,
there was eras based on the predominant
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings that were circulating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the cuttings that the cutting,
uh, houses were choosing to propagate and
[SPEAKER_03]: sell that determine what was ultimately
ending up in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause yeah, the cutting, those cutting
houses were rocking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I mean, you often hear a lot of
people talk about the cuts in the
[SPEAKER_02]: circulation at the moment, not being real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess let's put that aside for the
moment and instead talk about how there's
[SPEAKER_02]: like these alternative lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think like famously there was
Federation seeds, which crossed like white
[SPEAKER_02]: rhino and then did like this whole BX
thing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tried those alternative
Romulan cuts that like aren't the real
[SPEAKER_02]: ones, but are still out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, do you think they're good or
they're not like, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're okay, but it's not, it's totally
not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're okay, but totally not the same for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Romulan, I mean, what I could
believe about the Romulan story is that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was, there was a crew of guys that were
that had seeds like back in those days,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you got to imagine that just to
be able to get seeds that were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: were something worth, you know,
possibly worth growing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those would have been like hugely valuable
at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there was seeds that would have
come from Oregon and California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it up to Vancouver Island and it
was a lot of Americans in BC back in those
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could see.
[SPEAKER_03]: That part of the story where there was
guys mixing up genetics, trying to find
[SPEAKER_03]: some stuff that would work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't know about the validity
of, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: To, to elaborate more on those new
Romulans.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a cutting that's circulating as a
70, 79 Romulan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kind of figured out just by looking
back and you can look at on archive dot
[SPEAKER_03]: org at Emory seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go back into next generation in
whatever, whatever year, like 2000,
[SPEAKER_03]: early 2000s, they had a Romulan seven of
nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was, I think it was like,
I can't remember the description,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was like a seven times back cross
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just an example of how like
stories can kind of get out of whack.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like there is this cutting being
circulated as a 79 Romulan, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually seven of nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it got misplayed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden now it's pre 98,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just, it was seven of nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the word play in telephone,
how it works.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, it sounds quite plausible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be interested to hear, have you tried
any of the other related cuts to sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these are just some fans submitted
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the Albany pine bud or the
Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they stand up to Romulan or not really?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we're always like looking for
that fucking whacker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there's a, there's a cutting I
got from an old timer friend of mine that
[SPEAKER_03]: came from Salt Spring Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it turns out it was one of those next
generation or Federation seed line
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings that they just selected out that
they'd been growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: For years and years, but it wasn't the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this, the cutting eye, the Salt
Spring Romulan cut that I grew,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was very, uh, single Cola dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas like the original pond is
supposedly, uh, yeah, like a big mess of
[SPEAKER_03]: branches and buds, little buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop corny maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that word?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're not really popcorn cause
they're real hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking earlier about some hash
plants and we, we got a number of really
[SPEAKER_02]: good questions from some of our listeners
and one of them sort of asked,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that specifically there's like a
number of the BC hash plants and cushions
[SPEAKER_02]: that were associated with facilities on
the Vancouver Island back in like the late
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties, uh, sorry, late eighties,
early nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rumor was that like they came from
seed that was brought in with hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: like maybe like King hash or queen or
champagne or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notably white Buffalo has worked with most
of, if not all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, do you know the backstory on any
of these cushions or hash plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and do you think they stand up to the
stuff we see today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, they're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, do I know the story about them?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know the story about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that they, uh, came out of
the, the, uh, motorcycle got motorcycle
[SPEAKER_03]: club breeding collective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like the Nanaimo, the Nanaimo
motorcycle club, they were the predominant
[SPEAKER_03]: importers of, of, uh, of central Asian
hash in Canada, probably in like possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: in North America at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there's probably more Afghani
coming through the West coast than the
[SPEAKER_03]: East coast, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those, I mean, I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like apparently they pulled seeds out of
blocks of hash was the story, but I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if I believe those
stories just cause I, um, some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: seem like poly hybrids to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't, I don't know if I believe the
story and they're just, they're pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would tend to like my, in my mind,
um, if I didn't know anything about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say they're probably like a lot of
stuff in like the early Canadian stuff was
[SPEAKER_03]: that, um, that early Canadian stuff came
out of was from Holland, Holland seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my favorite like cushy thing from
back then is like the special K that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of my favorites that stood
the test of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's, that's even later than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even later than that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those, when I was working with Reefer
man, he got three hash plant cuts and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, two of them are related.
[SPEAKER_03]: One was called, it was called purple King.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he, uh, like renamed it to pink
Kush cause it had nice pink stigmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other one was called, they just
called it the King.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like at that time, I just knew
they're, you know, they're related,
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly related because they're both
named King.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we we've done a bunch of breeding
with them over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get them with all sorts of things
and growing out the progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and actually just by, uh, like growing
out the stuff, I would tend to think that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not land racy things because the
stuff that comes out of them is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, it seemed like they're poly
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're less than of the whole,
some of the whole, a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're really, the, the thing about
them is they make really awesome,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, bubble hash, bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely, there's something special
about those two plants that they make a
[SPEAKER_03]: type of hash that you very rarely see in
commercial or like in any weed plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: when you go to push the hash together,
it doesn't stick together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It pushes apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like there's like static when you
apply pressure and it just pushes it apart
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, they're really hard to push
into, uh, when they're, when they're
[SPEAKER_03]: really fresh, like when you're,
um, you know, not cured or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they kind of like just the turps,
I guess, or whatever compounds are in
[SPEAKER_03]: there, but, um, they're really,
um, it's really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the, the flower is not like super
potent or anything, but the hash is really
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those two particular plants, the King and
the Pink Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, that's great because as you might've
imagined, we got a number of questions
[SPEAKER_02]: from the fans about the Pink Kush because,
you know, like it's so prevalent and
[SPEAKER_02]: popular over the past decade or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet there also is so much sort of
mystery around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to confirm, are you saying that um,
Pink Kush comes from a cutting that was
[SPEAKER_02]: originally called King and then he renamed
it to Pink Kush and then there was another
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting and he called that King
thereafter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, it's what they were,
they were called, they were already called
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple King and the King.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but my friend, I haven't, like,
I met another friend later on who was
[SPEAKER_03]: growing those and, uh, he called them
Purple King.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said the other one was White King
or Green King.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were just calling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, I mean, it was just, you know,
they were, I think they were probably
[SPEAKER_03]: selling most of it as King, you know,
whether it's Purple or Green, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd be like, Oh, I got a bag of King.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, Oh, did you get the Purple
King or the Green King?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's how it went down if I had
to guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, those, those particular cuttings
were really, um, tightly handled.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the longest time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when Reeferman got him,
he was probably one of the first guys
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of the circle to actually get
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like my friend that I met later,
he was also one of those guys that he said
[SPEAKER_03]: he would have gotten in trouble if
somebody, you know, the wrong person found
[SPEAKER_03]: out that he was growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very tightly held.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like tight, tighter than tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, if you had to guess the
genetics, you said, do you think it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: polyhybrid of some sort?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's hash plant cross
something or?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably like, uh, if I had to guess,
um, and like, like I said before,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea, but in my mind,
it would be a cross of, maybe it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: a old world, uh, hash plant that they
pull, that they pull out of bricks that
[SPEAKER_03]: they were hitting it with, um,
seeds that they were getting from home.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they got something like Afghani or
like, they may have gotten some hash plant
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from Holland and mixed it with,
you know, what they were getting out of
[SPEAKER_03]: bricks, or maybe they got a bunch of
different plants out of bricks,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, seeds out of bricks and we're hitting
like mixing them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I mean, I just can't say I,
but I do think that it was a poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically all I'm trying to say is
I think it's a poly hybrid or both of them
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, after, after doing a number of
different hybrids with those King
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings, um, it would, it seemed to us
that the green King is the mother of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: of the pink crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you hit the pink crush,
you get way more banos out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like way all over,
like all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's like a really good, um,
it's a really good plant for finding,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause, uh, like it spits out stuff that
you wouldn't predict.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come out of there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the other, like on the other side
of things, it's, I would think it would be
[SPEAKER_03]: a really hard plant to inbreed to try and
like, uh, capture, you know, what did it,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, with the cuttings, like, unless you
like, uh, feminized it to try and make a
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line out of it, I think would be
fairly challenging.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of curiosity, do you think it
stands up to the stuff today?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, why do you think it's sort of
falling off in popularity?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, it is the stuff for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is big and it's hard to grow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not the easiest shit to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pink crush is the number one plant,
uh, grown in Canada right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe GMO is probably, um, but yeah,
pink crush seems to be like, at least here
[SPEAKER_03]: where we are, where we are, it rules the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we are, it's just, it's all pink
crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally nine out of 10 people are
growing pink crush, uh, in the whole west
[SPEAKER_03]: coast of BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to clarify, you think like it's
sort of still on the uptrend or like,
[SPEAKER_02]: or at least it's not falling off at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, it's falling off the cliff and it's
like doing a 9,000 foot, uh, free fall
[SPEAKER_00]: into hell right now as we speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's errors done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like stick a fork in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hopefully this fall we'll see some
something pop up and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll see this kind of, yeah, there's
definitely like, uh, I think the next
[SPEAKER_03]: trend is going to be some, uh,
flavor, a bunch of flavor weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I think, uh, I think we're going
to see a bunch of different stuff instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of one, you know, instead of pink crush
dominating, I think we're going to see a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because like all the guys that are
growing it, uh, they now have a pink
[SPEAKER_03]: crush, a PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue dream of Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just been overgrown and they,
uh, the combination between the last six
[SPEAKER_03]: months, in the last six months,
the Canadian legal flower mart,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the Canadian legal cannabis market
has flatlined.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sales have not increased.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so those guys are dropping all their
prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're like, there's like a huge war
basically between commercial legal weed
[SPEAKER_03]: and commercial black market weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, uh, at the end of the day,
um, there's too much pink crush and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the price has, has to drop down to
nothing basically, cause there's no one,
[SPEAKER_03]: no one's buying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're like, yeah, I got like,
you know, the guys that are buying it
[SPEAKER_03]: already have what they have, you know,
they don't need anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guys that, and farmers being
farmers, um, when the price of a crop goes
[SPEAKER_03]: down, yeah, you got a double.
[SPEAKER_03]: Double your production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so we're, we're, uh, yeah,
we're going to have, obviously that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: that situation is not going to work out
too well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of curiosity, do you think the,
you mentioned like, you know, the next big
[SPEAKER_02]: push will be like fruity flavorful
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any predictions at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it'll be something that jumps
over from California or maybe something
[SPEAKER_02]: unique will come out of the woodworks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well in Canada, a lot of guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, pull stuff out of random seeds stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and a lot of it is just like,
uh, you know, BX, uh, whatever you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, a lot of it is name
cross name kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, that's just, uh,
it's got the right names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they'll pull stuff out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but definitely there's a ton of stuff
coming up from the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we actually have the amount of,
um, elite cuttings in Canada is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is pretty huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's pretty impressive actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'm just saying, like, I think,
uh, I think the fruity thing is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be the next thing just because,
uh, that's, you know, that's the big trend
[SPEAKER_03]: down south.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, and we're already seeing,
um, what guys are asking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, it's, uh, it's stuff
that has, uh, you know, like fruity,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I call it like flavor weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how else to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me take us back for a little bit to
those earlier days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we've got some really cool fan
submitted questions here again,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they just sort of asked, you know,
in the earlier days, there was like a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of seed companies that were all
operating out of the same post office on
[SPEAKER_02]: Nana Mayo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there like much collegiality,
like cooperation between the different
[SPEAKER_02]: groups or was everyone just like keeping
their head down, doing their own thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would say everyone was fairly
independent back in those days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, the fact they were using the same
mailbox just means that that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerant, uh, mailbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same thing in Vancouver, there's a
mailbox by Emery seeds that when the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: market in Vancouver opened up,
like they all got mailboxes at that,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, Money Mart, um, by Emery seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was thinking like, did the mail stuff
ever say anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like you get like these hordes of
mail from all over the world and like the
[SPEAKER_02]: volume of packages you're sending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, like I don't, I don't know,
you know, to be honest, I don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know they tolerated it and.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know, like you can't,
uh, there's so much privacy with mail laws
[SPEAKER_03]: that, uh, I don't think it's really up to
the staff, you know, to determine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think that's the jurisdiction
addiction of like the postal service to
[SPEAKER_03]: determine if there's something not,
you know, not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, another question we got sort of
around that time was did any of the DEA
[SPEAKER_02]: raids on Mark Emery or the general
crackdown around that time ever affect you
[SPEAKER_02]: or get you sort of concerned?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a follow-up, did it, did it affect
seed sales either going up or down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it definitely affected the seed
sales that he was generating.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, well, you know, like by the time
he was getting busted, there was,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a ton of other seed companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, the seed sales were just exploding
at that time, you know, whether you bought
[SPEAKER_03]: from Mark Emery or Kine seeds or a bunch
of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember them all, but yeah,
at that time there was, uh, there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: place called the pot block in Vancouver
and, uh, there was some buildings there
[SPEAKER_03]: that like, uh, landlords that were
tolerant landlords and they would rent out
[SPEAKER_03]: to, uh, various seed guys, uh,
like, uh, smoking Sean was one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kine seeds, uh, legend seeds, Emery seeds,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guy down around the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few others, uh, Canada seed,
seed bank of Canada was super sketchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, those were the original
seed, uh, Canadian seed bank pioneers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a few in, uh, the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the, uh, London seed bank,
Chris Clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, go back seed bank.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, of course, heaven's, uh, stairway,
uh, who else would be in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, those were the main,
those were the main.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it spook you at all?
Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, uh, like the main concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is, uh, just being rated at your personal,
you know, grow or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rated like three times and
through the, uh, through the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: rigmarole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, luckily we had excellent lawyers
like Kurt two saw who stood up for lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers around this, around the West coast
and, you know, helped pave the way for
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, MMAR program and then the ACMPR
on and on we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to, to chuck things over to an older
strain, I'd love to grab some perspective
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Texada time warp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably one of the most widely
dispersed outdoor genetics in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it originates from like, you know,
the VC Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is probably the oldest
Canadian clone going around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think it was, it comes from like
the seventies or something, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's some, uh, I mean,
there's questions about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that that's, that's that old.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's questions about, um, but I mean,
I've grown it since, uh, the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's at least 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, it's hard to say it like
some of these cuttings that people think,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people's, uh, memory, you know,
there's a little bit of memory loss,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, involved, you know, with a lot of
these cuttings, they, people think that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're a lot older than they actually
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, just cause, uh, you know,
maybe, you know, the people weren't,
[SPEAKER_03]: they weren't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, you know, they weren't,
they weren't there when it like emerged
[SPEAKER_03]: onto the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you don't really know,
you know, like just, uh, we'll go back a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys at that time on tech Seda,
uh, they were getting seats sent up from
[SPEAKER_00]: humble County, uh, as well, all over the
hippie hash trail, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you had a lot of people that were,
uh, you know, they weren't, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: rich, they, uh, barely had electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they had electricity, it was the
house down the road that they use once a
[SPEAKER_00]: week or something, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that, in that timeframe,
I think a lot of, um, those things were
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing and there was a fell on the Island
that made some seeds, Mr. Lambert and
[SPEAKER_00]: passed them out to, uh, the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kept looking for the fastest
finishers, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in four or five years that
something like the time warp came up is
[SPEAKER_00]: the story I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, in the late seventies,
in the late seventies around 79 and those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys didn't even have electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to their parents' house and put
a fluorescent light, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the closet and took a cutting and
revenge that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, they had to learn about,
uh, revenge and cloning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like all new and like light,
like what's the kind of light you use to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow a plant indoors to keep it alive over
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, you know, we've seen
it to really take a beating in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like how it grows, you know,
it's become powdery mildew susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing, powdery mildew wasn't even the
thing when we were like young,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you never saw it ever around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how the fuck would that plan even know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, it's an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy personally, I assume it's an
old plant just because back in the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: the old time, the old timers held it with,
you know, quite a bit of a reverence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I assume it was, I assume it's like
maybe 30 years old, at least maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know the guy that I got it from,
um, his son, he had had it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: His son was alive and his son died at the
age of 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's at least 20 years tagged
onto what we've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, theoretically it could,
um, could be from 1978, but I,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like maybe there's something
added on in the, in the early,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the eighties or whatever that we don't
know about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a lot of Camaro driving
people back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, like one thing they like to do is
they'll, uh, like I've been around here a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and they'll take genetics like
time warp, indica, a three, but they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just call it time warp and they'll give
you the cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this is my time warp,
you know, but, uh, when you go and sit
[SPEAKER_00]: down and smoke with them, they're like,
no, that's the mighty mighty Afghan time
[SPEAKER_00]: warp, indica, a five, a three,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's got all this shit in it
that they cross together every year to get
[SPEAKER_00]: something out of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, there's,
could be, a little bit of that play too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, there's so many, there's so
many, uh, cuts over the years that people
[SPEAKER_03]: have called time warp that have been
handed around that word time warp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing with Romulan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you there's like 50 Romulan cuts out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one we have is the original one
that all the old people grew and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, yeah, verifies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think it's, you know, it's,
it's good enough to keep around for
[SPEAKER_03]: however long it's been around for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's got really, cool qualities to
like the, uh, the way it flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: passes on those flowering genetics to
other plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got, uh, it's got auto flower in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it, it's, it has out of flower in its
genetics, but as a plant, it's a semi auto
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it gets root bound, it starts
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the genetics are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's obviously a sativa,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the closest thing I've seen is,
uh, something called Nigerian nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of reminds me of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, which is like a Nigerian hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, it kind of seems like it could
be something like there's some,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, African or Southeast Asian or,
you know, it's like some sativa that's
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonably fast, you know, in,
in there, that would be my guess that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's it's a mix of, uh, something semi
like something auto flowering that they
[SPEAKER_03]: mixed with something, um, with maybe a
little bit of Afghani, but maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a whole lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause, uh, like that was in those days,
Afghani wasn't even really like,
[SPEAKER_03]: not a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't even really a thing until the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, like when I grow it inside,
I see like a plant that's Southeast Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: and Thai like, you know, and when it gets
into the sun, it gets more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hashiness of like something you find in
the middle East come out kind of a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, we sent it into what the fuck
was that company called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing banged up on the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, did it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's there's nothing related,
nothing related to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you hear the guys who were running
around the hash trail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like, uh, you hear it could be like a
Nepalese cross or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something weird like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of the cuts that came out of
texedo was a three Indica and it came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people were throwing hemp seed
in their, in their yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a plant that came up that ended
up, you know, getting grown for years and
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, had a really nice grape smell,
big buds, but the weather was better back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think too, we had longer, longer
summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's we've gotten more rain in the falls
these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, uh, you got to keep up with
the breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think also, um, plants are used to
a specific time period is as crazy as it
[SPEAKER_03]: sounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they're used to their, the environment
they were born in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, obviously the earth is slightly,
it's more than slightly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The earth is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like the climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is different from when it was back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of different things that
have changed since those days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think like a plant is,
has evolved for a specific time period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like we're way past that time period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would make sense that that plant is,
is not, uh, uh, adapted for the conditions
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can get down with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as one final question to sort of
wrap up on the time warp questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed you guys work with a plant
called pine warp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that one that's just, in your opinion,
sort of like an all round improvement on
[SPEAKER_02]: the time warp, or is it different in sort
of its own thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's a commercial plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was during the time when there was a
lot of outdoor growing going on on the
[SPEAKER_00]: coast and they were looking for something
that was like, and, uh, just harder nugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that would, uh, bigger nugs that would
fill a bag faster, faster, faster
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was changing, easier trimming,
easier trimming for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: More weight totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it was across, uh, the tree frog
was its sister, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, uh, possibly a cream soda.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of the cream soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, times the time warp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody will tell you that, but that's what
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cream soda was one of the original
building blocks back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of ours, uh, on the island grew
some, uh, some, some of the mix that came
[SPEAKER_03]: from texeda, like from the texeda crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, um, definitely had some cream
soda in there in my, my guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my, my, uh, theory or whatever,
but yeah, um, the cream soda cup,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has like every, when you cross it with
something, it'll give you every single
[SPEAKER_03]: color combination possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of why, uh, um,
some of the stuff like a pine warp and
[SPEAKER_03]: tree frog has got some cool colors going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the original ones were like,
uh, baseball bats, you know, you can knock
[SPEAKER_00]: your friend out, you know, super thick and
hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, the pine warp was
definitely an improvement on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that sucks about the pine
warp is it has, uh, those terpenes that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't hang around a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get into a bag of it,
you know, two months down the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, Oh, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bad, it's got to go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way thing, you know,
it was early, so you get a higher price
[SPEAKER_00]: for your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if it was in, if like that three weeks
earlier than the market, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a little bit of a bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were always chasing that over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there'd be a drought in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wouldn't be any weed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be out and those days don't exist
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was part of like how they indoor,
um, thing evolved is because there was
[SPEAKER_03]: this drought in August and, uh,
to take advantage of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to run a indoor crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like the price was, you could sell
everything at the highest price and it
[SPEAKER_03]: could be wet and you'd get like 3,600 a
pound wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: American back then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another variety I wanted to quickly
ask a question about was I noticed that
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys use a plant you call the special
cush in the special cush haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the backstory on that cush?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that one is actually related to the
Kings.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mother of special cush is a plant
called queen, which is somehow related to
[SPEAKER_03]: the Kings, um, and crossed with,
uh, an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a queen Afghani and, uh, by vision
creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's a really good cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, I mean, we, we smoke all the
American things that come up and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: it is complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits hard and it always has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stands up to most anything in the car
that you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed on your site, you've also worked
with an X 18 plan, and I wanted to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: your thoughts on some of the various Tom
Hill lines you might've worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think you see a lot of DC like
deep chunk stuff around, but you really
[SPEAKER_02]: don't see much X 18 or like pine tar cush
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on him?
[SPEAKER_02]: His lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're very consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pine, I think the pine tar and the X
18 came from his father.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was those were his father's the
chemist and the deep chunk was from Tom
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I recall the deep chunk, I mean the X
18 out of those three, like I've grown all
[SPEAKER_03]: three, the X 18 seems to have the most,
um, the best flavors and, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: it seems to be the most commercial,
like the better yield out of all of them
[SPEAKER_03]: and more, um, vigorous, the most bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was the problem with the deep
chunk is it's the ones I grew anyways,
[SPEAKER_03]: were very, they're highly inbred.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're, uh, very slow, very slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the pink, I don't, I can't really
like, I can't remember the pine tar push,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was very, uh, inbred too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, but interestingly
enough, the pine tar cush, if you've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: grown it, it's one of the few plants that
reminds me of pink cush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your listeners that have grown pine tar
cush, it's fairly similar, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: grown it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I don't really, I can't really say
much about it, but I can say that,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the X, the X 18 is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's got a nice high, it's not like
super potent, um, but it's really like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got pretty good potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you ever see the, I always read
about this fabled green apple Fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever come across that in the X
18?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's lots of those green apple
and a parrot and, uh, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: gin, there's like gin in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty common actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a random curve ball question I've
got for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the more rare narrow leaf
varieties that you think the general
[SPEAKER_02]: public are not particularly aware of in
terms of like the quality of the effect or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the unique nature of the effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any things that you think are a
bit underrepresented?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, I think first to preface that
question, we need to, we need to like look
[SPEAKER_03]: at, um, the various land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they are is they've taken regional
seed stock and applied to, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: generic name to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in truth, there's like each one of
those has infinite variations of it with a
[SPEAKER_03]: general theme within a general theme.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, as far as answering the question,
what are some things that I think
[SPEAKER_03]: everything like, except for the,
like the real old timers, um, I think
[SPEAKER_03]: everything's been, you know, miss been
missing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, I mean, all that's, you can find
good stuff anywhere in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of finding the guys
that kept the, you know, that knew how to
[SPEAKER_03]: select, uh, good, the good shit from the
bad shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fucking, the good flower from the
hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it can cut the good shit can come
from anywhere in my, in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a land rave than a land
race in my mind, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that's the, that's the word I
like to use in my brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Land, uh, land race is kind of,
uh, it's kind of a controversial term to
[SPEAKER_03]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mean like in the sense that it's
just like so widely misused?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, it, to me, the word land race
means, uh, plants that are selected by
[SPEAKER_03]: the, by the land, um, without really
without human intervention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cause when they're like the breeders,
the old school breeders, when they're
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding wheat or whatever, they would go
out into the land and they would get,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would do their selections from the
land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would you call like a strain from
like that a certain Afghan village has
[SPEAKER_02]: worked for, you know, however many years
historically?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would call that a heirloom or a regional
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cultivar is meaning something that's
cultivated and they're like intentionally
[SPEAKER_03]: selecting seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it could, it could have, it could have
aspects of a land race, like the palms
[SPEAKER_03]: coming over from the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's basically heirloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you, I mean, yeah, in my mind
right now I'm thinking maybe that is a
[SPEAKER_03]: land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if it's got palm coming over
from the land, it's got the influence of a
[SPEAKER_03]: land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, but if they're like somehow
managing not to get cross pollinated,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, from the outside, um, like if you
were, let's say there was an area,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, of Afghanistan or Pakistan or
whatever, where it's only just farms where
[SPEAKER_03]: there it's like so dry that you can only
grow your, your weed plants in certain
[SPEAKER_03]: spots and it's all being farmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that's, that could be a bunch of
different heirlooms, um, with some slight
[SPEAKER_03]: cross pollination or maybe extreme amounts
of cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty interesting to talk about though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to like, to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far do you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like I, I find it interesting how,
uh, the change, the terminology is
[SPEAKER_03]: constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, you know, is this cannabis
sativa?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this, uh, is this a narrow leaf drug
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a lot of, uh, you know,
different changes in the nomenclature that
[SPEAKER_03]: have happened in the recent history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going to even say, like,
I, I agree with, um, many of the sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: ideas you just put forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've noticed is that people like to
use the term heirloom to, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: in all honesty, if I'm going to be very
reductive, it's probably just ultimately a
[SPEAKER_02]: sales thing, but people will use it to
describe like a clone that's been in a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain area for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I think when I asked someone
about it, I can't remember who they said,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, if you've been growing it in
that area for 10 plus years, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: acclimatized to that environment and it's
an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, heirloom is, uh, just means
something that's passed, passed along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it came from the heirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the loom that came from the heirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thread was woven by the loom that came
from the heirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you can call it whatever you
want to heirloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it came from someone else, I was
hanging onto it because it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, in my mind anyways,
that's what matters is that the people are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the things that they like and
keeping them from generation to generation
[SPEAKER_00]: and year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do believe that clones can
acclimatize because, uh, every time you
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it, um, the plant is always adapting
and where you select the actual,
[SPEAKER_03]: the particular part of the plant where you
select your cuttings from will actually
[SPEAKER_03]: have slight variations in genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, if you take a cut from the top of
the plant, it will be more, it'll have
[SPEAKER_03]: more silica, um, dominance.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the top and the outside of the branches
is more silica dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the bottom and the inside of the
branches is more calcium dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, like the north side of the plant
will be different from the south side of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant, for instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, there's slight, very slight,
uh, differences in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't hear that talked about very
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're talking about slight
variations in genetics, I, I, I forgot to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it up earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were talking about the Iraqi F2s
you did, did you see anything come out in
[SPEAKER_02]: the F2s that was like recessive and not in
the F1s or were they like, quote,
[SPEAKER_02]: land race enough that it was like,
largely speaking, homogenous because the
[SPEAKER_02]: lime was sort of pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no, it wasn't pure at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, uh, we only did, it was a
one-to-one selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would have been those two individual
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to think about as a,
uh, the F2s were kind of like a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably, it's like, probably more
like a hybrid, like I have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because it's just a shit mix,
you know, of Iraqi genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, we're still,
it's going to take, like, there was all
[SPEAKER_03]: sorts of variations of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it's going to take a few more
generations to, to, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: get it stabilized, looking consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some, um, some interesting terms that
are used in, uh, breeding terminology are,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, stability and consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, I like to think about these things
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, stability means a plant that
you can use for breeding that the progeny
[SPEAKER_03]: are not all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of you, a lot of people use the
word stability to mean plants that don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: don't, uh, get like herm flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you call a plant that doesn't
produce hermaphrodite flowers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, a true female?
[SPEAKER_03]: True female?
[SPEAKER_00]: An arrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like, I have this discussion in one
form or another with lots of guests
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's, it's not just in this
particular example, it's, it's replete
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout all of our nomenclature,
people misuse it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it sort of all boils down to
this issue of like, you know, cause some
[SPEAKER_02]: people like to be like, Oh, an Indica is
actually meant to mean Indian,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is Sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like they, they go through
that whole sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it sort of boils down to this
idea of, well, do, do I use the
[SPEAKER_02]: technically incorrect term because we both
know what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, we're, we're talking,
we're trying to represent that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about the same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, or do we like draw a line in the sand
and say, like, we have to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, really get on top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, one of those terms is an
academic term and the other one's like
[SPEAKER_03]: just a regular, regular day language.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most donors, they don't really care
about like narrow leaf drug cultivar,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, broad leaf drug cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want to know, does it have a
cerebral effect or does it have more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: relaxing body effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, so I think that,
uh, I mean, that's ultimately the
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a hard question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do you, uh, amplify those
qualities that are important enough to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, give it a name or give it a
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's, you know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what we come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people smoking weed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's definitely something that evolves
over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's probably those terms are probably
going to be thrown up like completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to just, uh, be extinct at
some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cause like it just, it won't make any
sense at some point, um, because
[SPEAKER_03]: everything's, you know, everything's
hybridized and, um, there's just so many
[SPEAKER_03]: variations that you kind of just like slop
a label.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this one's indica, this one's sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I think you can definitely say
like this one's got more cerebral
[SPEAKER_03]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I like to do it when I'm
bio essaying is like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the qualities that you like as a person,
how does that reflect out in a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, um, depends what kind of
person you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're creative, you're mathematic,
you're whatever, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: so like, uh, it's just, uh, yeah,
it'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking lost myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing about it is, um,
sorry, you fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, another thing about it is,
um, um, with the new, all these,
[SPEAKER_03]: like we bred out, not us per se,
but the community has bred out all the
[SPEAKER_03]: alternative cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we rediscover all those alternative
cannabinoids, we're going to have to come
[SPEAKER_03]: up with a new definitions for things like,
you know, what is, what does CBC bring to
[SPEAKER_03]: the table?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is, uh, um, THC V like, you know,
when, when we started having more complex,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, combinations, like THC V mixed with a
high THC with, you know, if you had like
[SPEAKER_03]: the, uh, relaxing the non cerebral
terpenes, uh, mixed with THC V and high
[SPEAKER_03]: THC, what's going to happen, you know,
like, um, and then throw in some CVC,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, uh, like a big shot of CVC or
something like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, we're, we're going to be moving into
uncharted territory, uncharted territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're only dealing with two
cannabinoids right now, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the most part, Yeah, look,
it's, it's going to be wild and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had a range of different,
uh, predictions in the past, including,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, people won't even be smoking weed in
the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be all produced by yeast and it'll
just be like cannabinoid infused beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all we'll do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some interesting, uh, ideas for the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to quickly bring us back
though, to the past for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's, it's the present, but it's
also the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that in the past, you guys had,
um, ran some ads in high times and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: interested to hear, like, what's your
thoughts on high times now versus in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past and specifically, do you think it has
any sort of real value at this point?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't think it had much value.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, other than, uh, it was
something for people to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: get stoned and look at, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just, it was just something in culture
to bring the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing that question into the mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, uh, to me, it's like,
uh, national, no, it's a national
[SPEAKER_03]: inquirer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The newspapers you see at the,
at the grocery store in the lineup,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, uh, with like,
uh, Kanye West did this and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's a, it's a, it was a
delivery vehicle for advertisement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like let's be, let's be straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was, uh, yeah, like it was
started by, uh, law, law types or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like, like they knew the laws
and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they knew what they could get away
with, but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was for, it's cool for what it,
what it did, like break ground and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like get the cannabis in the
general consciousness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as far as like the quality of what it
was, um, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you have it gang.
