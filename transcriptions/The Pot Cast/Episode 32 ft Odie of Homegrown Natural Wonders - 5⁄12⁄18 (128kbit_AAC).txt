[SPEAKER_02]: On this episode, we're joined by the one
and only Odie of Homegrown Natural
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking all things homegrown natural
wonders, breeding, time-wrecked males and
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, so a huge hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you and welcome to Odie of Homegrown
Natural Wonders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hello there.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first question, what are you currently
smoking on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right at the moment, I just loaded up a
bowl of Dr. Who from Geek Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mastercut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my faves to go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very relaxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Dr. Who is very high in
mercine, so I find it really relaxing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just jumped straight to one of my
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the biggest things I wanted to
ask you, I think a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: including myself, gained a lot of
familiarity with your brand through the
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure that Geek Mic gave you guys kind
of with that Dr. Who cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, how impactful has it
been to have something like that happen to
[SPEAKER_02]: your brand, to kind of have a really good
grower find this killer cut and run with
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Who is definitely one of our top
sellers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, everybody that grows it seems to
like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's quite a bit of it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I'm a huge fan of Geek Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're obviously really good friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I'm excited for all their
success and future success as well as I
[SPEAKER_03]: know he is for ours as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did the success of the Dr. Who kind of
immediately make it a candidate in your
[SPEAKER_02]: mind for like maybe a male in future
breeding crosses, or was it not the
[SPEAKER_02]: immediate thought?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was definitely an immediate
thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the one that came up,
the whole Dr. Who thing and did the
[SPEAKER_03]: original Dr. Who cross was my son Donnery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and his brother, my oldest son Ray,
they got together and did this whole thing
[SPEAKER_03]: and planned out all kinds of plants that
we had to make stuff multiple times before
[SPEAKER_03]: we got to their end game of what they
wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we started cruising through that,
yeah, we knew we'd always wanted Dr. Who
[SPEAKER_03]: male and we've picked one now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what type of females do you think
would pair well with Dr. Who?
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, we just recently did a bunch
of crosses with our Dr. Who male.
[SPEAKER_03]: 17 different strains, different moms we
crossed the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: SFV, Lemon G, just a whole slew of
standard old goodies, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: old cuts and whatnots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of them came out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dr. Who male that we picked was chosen
for specific structure and smell that it
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're wanting to do the Dr. Who down
to about an F5, F6 to get to where the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual what the Dr. Who is going to be
when it's completed, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like how it regenerates,
how the doctor regenerates all the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was picked for how close he was
resembled the great high two cut that we
[SPEAKER_03]: run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very sweet, very grapey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very dominant in the crosses that
we saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We even crossed him to a form cut cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my friends asked me if I would do
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just as a quick little side
question, out of all the cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: which one's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I'm not a big cookies fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not have, I've never grown
cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not have done the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend would not have asked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously he's a pretty good,
pretty close friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just as another little cookies
question, do you feel like at this point
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of been able to solidify itself
as one of those elite clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's still just kind of
like a hypey thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it's probably an elite
panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely is in certain circles,
especially here in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of, there's a lot of
places that are cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody likes the cookies and don't get
me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cookie dough flavor is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only kind of wish that some of them
produced better the different cuts,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So automatically you want to find a male
that's going to add your size and your
[SPEAKER_03]: weight and, you know, try to keep the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead of hitting them, yeah,
instead of, I'm just not a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was something that I was
offered at a very early age when it came
[SPEAKER_03]: out and turned it down and haven't grown
it since.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never grown it, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on that note, early age,
let's take us back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven, eight years old, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking cannabis with a cousin of mine,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our parents grew and it was it was all
over and all around, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're talking the 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was at that point in time in the,
in the family, the family that I was in
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was plenty abundant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't like my parents didn't know
that I was smoking, but my cousin and I
[SPEAKER_03]: sure were taking some smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you know what strains they were
back then, or it was just whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I just, it was just whatever,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had no clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're never really in on those
conversations really to know what was
[SPEAKER_03]: what.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found the hash stash every now and
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was always nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, normally just buds here and
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were definitely nothing like what we
smoke today, looking at these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what was the progression to you
becoming a grower yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lived with my mom for a while and then hit
teenage years.
[SPEAKER_03]: She couldn't handle me anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she sent me to my father's house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at the age of 14 who was living in
Northern Idaho and growing garage fulls of
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he kind of handed me a book and said,
get up in the, I didn't start doing this,
[SPEAKER_03]: start doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that pretty much started me growing
was when I was 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which book did he give you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right off the top of my head,
I don't remember, but it's one of the old
[SPEAKER_03]: clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an old classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember right at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like an RC Clark thing or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was Frank, Mel Frank and Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it was Rosenthal,
but Grower's Bible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a 1982 version or something like that
had a big old pot, had a big old bud cold
[SPEAKER_03]: on the front pitch on the front cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I had that book for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good, good mentor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually a refound it at pal pal's books
there in Portland and in the use book
[SPEAKER_03]: section and bought it for my father so he
could have it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's neat full circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during those early days when you were
growing, was there any notable strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that went around in your area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it just really, everything wasn't
having names at that point?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and we were, I was living in a
Northern Idaho at the point in time and
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk was king.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was, there were several
really good strains, not really any names
[SPEAKER_03]: with much of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, I was still in junior
high, so we weren't really that concerned
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were more concerned that five bags
later and you're still smelling it and
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty ridiculous to walk anywhere with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you have any recollections of the
roadkill skunk or what are your thoughts
[SPEAKER_02]: on it in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I love skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been searching for it ever since I've
left Idaho.
[SPEAKER_03]: The closest thing that I've seen is what
Duke is putting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that if anybody's going to
find the old school roadkill, it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be him.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of kind of discussion around
the whole idea and something which I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in is the idea that maybe there
was not necessarily one roadkill skunk,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was more of kind of like a profile
which maybe popped up in one or two
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's any maybe credence to
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think, no, it was very much just
one clone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I would totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself, I kind of look back to the popular
strains and go back a year or two and see
[SPEAKER_03]: what war was happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most likely that's where it came from,
is whatever region we were having a war
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what are your thoughts on the land
races in terms of like, would you consider
[SPEAKER_02]: working them or?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a good buddy, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing a bunch of work with some land
races right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all donated a bunch of land race
seed stock that we had so that he could
[SPEAKER_03]: start working with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, so I think that the plant
has used us to progress itself along as
[SPEAKER_03]: most things do, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we take it everywhere,
we've given it life and existence,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we've done a lot for the plant as far
as the plant also does a lot for us,
[SPEAKER_03]: don't get me wrong, at least a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's manipulated us to where we do all
this crazy stuff for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it progression the way that it
should be with us doing all the
[SPEAKER_03]: interbreeding and crossbreeding and
multi-quad polypeptide, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: polybreeding and all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's progressing away as long
as what you're making is better than what
[SPEAKER_03]: it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to work with land races, a lot of land
races run really long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's a reason why when
you look at a picture of the buds in the
[SPEAKER_03]: high times from the 70s, and you look at a
picture of the buds from the high times
[SPEAKER_03]: now, it's a huge difference, which would
you rather, you know, which would you
[SPEAKER_03]: rather smoke, first off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Negative land races are nice, they're very
unique highs, very unique flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nowadays, we're more about the strong
potencies and maybe even stronger or more
[SPEAKER_03]: isolated flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, to work with some land races,
I have a few IBLs in stock and we play
[SPEAKER_03]: with them every now and again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a long project because you need
to, you know, out-cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Land races are strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see those for, and IBLs are strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see those for generations down the
line, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what characteristics are you looking
for and what characteristics do you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to grab from it and get it to express?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess it begs the question,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you like to bring to the game?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think the modern criticism of
cannabis is that there's this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: same-same amongst everything and that
there's also like this ceiling where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can only get so high, whereas a lot of
people would argue that with certain land
[SPEAKER_02]: races, you would just, you know,
the more you smoke, the further you would
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are those the type of things you would be
looking to bring into modern crosses?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when people describe that,
and I remember, you know, I started
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking very young, so I started smoking
mid to late 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I remember everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I know all the names?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do remember a lot of the effects and
a lot of the ways that it made me feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm able to use that to kind of guide
me in what my memory is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I can find the land races from back
then that made me feel that way,
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to play with them because yeah,
they were, you know, but then again,
[SPEAKER_03]: was it my age?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it because I had nothing else to
compare it to?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that all comes into a factor as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I would like to definitely get
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some land races that I would
like to play with if I could find,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, true seeds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which ones are they?
[SPEAKER_03]: More of your Afganicas, more of your Hindu
mountains areas, more Indicas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more of an Indica guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not much into the Sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may or may not have heard about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of been on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got tagged in it a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's kind of been some talks about like
the origins of the triangle Kush having
[SPEAKER_02]: come in out recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, you know, to cut a long
story short, it's meant to be some old
[SPEAKER_02]: school Cali strand called Emerald triangle
crossed to Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't suppose you've heard about this
kind of little saga at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, if not, what do you think
about, you know, kind of that as a
[SPEAKER_02]: potential genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see any Hindu Kush in the triangle
Kush?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I actually, I have heard a
little bit, read a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: My kind of thoughts on that is that
they're just now coming out with that
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all of a sudden you just woke
up, oh yeah, we crossed that for this and
[SPEAKER_03]: created this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of hard to swallow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that are just saying it though,
you know, I know them and they have done a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of good strains
that they've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, but having, you know,
we just had Chrome over the garden here a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of days back, looking at some of
their genetics that we just germinated
[SPEAKER_03]: over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he's pretty infamous for
the TK and a lot of the TK crosses and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't talk with him about it,
but I do know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a couple of things that,
you know, come to question in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think people are going to be
wondering out of the Swamp Boys gear,
[SPEAKER_02]: which ones did you decide to germ?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good golly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the list with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did two different germinations of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one was 6,300 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next one was 2,800 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was several breeders and several
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I could not rattle them off
without having my list in front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell you some of the breeders,
but I couldn't definitely tell you all the
[SPEAKER_03]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone would expect you to
remember with a list that big,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the question which jumps to mind is
how many seeds of each strain would you
[SPEAKER_02]: like to run when you do a phenohunt of
that size?
[SPEAKER_03]: At least 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that way you're getting 50 to 60
females to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty harsh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they fall over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't stick them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gladiator school when you're a
seedling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't baby them in any way,
shape or form and survival if it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of all those seeds, we came back with
3,700 females that we looked through and
[SPEAKER_03]: have picked maybe 400 to bring back out to
Reeve Edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was going to be my next
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do a phenohunt of that size,
how long does it take you to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: discern the winner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you just kind of implied,
there's probably going to be a lot that
[SPEAKER_02]: are really neck and neck at that end
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you've got to do them again and
again type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several that are neck to neck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's the thing is you grow
them out to almost completion before you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to Reeve Edge them or clone them and
Reeve Edge them or however, so that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can see all of its final traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's really close on a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them might have just a little bit
better structure or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it got bent here or something or
restrained here, maybe it didn't perform
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as it could have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you think maybe it performed better
next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much three, within three runs will
be down to maybe 1% of the 400.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe 40 strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many end keepers would you ideally
like to keep at the end of it all?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's rough at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you're getting down to the
pretty nitty gritty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I mean, because we've got a
lot of Canorado, we've got a lot of Karma,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got a lot of Swamp Boys,
we've got Oni, we've got I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a whole bunch of the great
breeders out there that we're privileged
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to germinate a lot of seeds of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are all just so fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to pick one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would rather window it down to
maybe two or three per breeder than just
[SPEAKER_03]: two or three strains overall, kind of a
thing, just because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because a breeder is more of a more of an
artist and you know, they're they painted
[SPEAKER_03]: this picture for you to kind of color in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would definitely I think I'm shooting
for that rap.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't completely decided all that way
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's kind of where I'm
thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the end goal of doing this big
Feanor hunt, besides obviously having the
[SPEAKER_02]: clone, is it to kind of offer that to the
market or more so as a breeding queen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it's for market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's we're doing this at one of our
clients facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's totally for their market
for them to be able to bring to the market
[SPEAKER_03]: and have variety and diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things I'm thinking
about and I often hear is like a complex
[SPEAKER_02]: issue, so to speak, is the the idea of how
people want more sativa being offered and
[SPEAKER_02]: more variety along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a whole bunch of issues that
come along with that in regards to price
[SPEAKER_02]: points, flower times, all things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your stance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like people are asking for
something, but they're not willing to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: it on the other hand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, how do you feel about it
all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: People talk about land races, but most
land races, most land race sativas are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to take you 16 to 20 something weeks
to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, on a production scale type
of a model, that just really doesn't work
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's nobody out there in a
market that will pay two to three times
[SPEAKER_03]: the amount for the same eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're already complaining about paying
30 or 40 dollars for an eighth from the
[SPEAKER_03]: market and now all of a sudden it's 60 to,
you know, one hundred and twenty dollars
[SPEAKER_03]: for that same eight just because it's a
land race or something to that effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point in time, the market is not
there for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it is possible in the future
to definitely see a craft style market for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a big thing to come yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the whole craft thing is going to
stick around for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the big scale people,
it's hard for them to do craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in regards to the craft market,
do you think that that's like it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of to emerge?
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends on where you're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_03]: Craft market is king.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's I think I feel that that's,
you know, a price point, I feel kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: proves that most pounds in Oregon are
twelve to sixteen hundred for indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are considered craft and you have
the brand and you have the recognition of
[SPEAKER_03]: said craft, you're still getting twenty
four, twenty six hundred dollars a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't really changed that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't have that brand and if
you don't have something special,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you know, here in California,
this market here is a lot different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it depends on where you're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some parts of it, they want fruit,
some parts they want gas, the other parts
[SPEAKER_03]: they want cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to be able to appease all of
those on a larger scale market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as.
[SPEAKER_03]: Craft for many of the large guys,
yeah, you'll probably see some coming,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think that it'll take a little bit
for everybody to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, perfect segue on that issue of
craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you've heard about it,
about the infamous hundred dollar eights
[SPEAKER_02]: of Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spoke to aficionado Leo not long ago,
and he said he thinks that's the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that's happened in the cannabis
industry in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of maybe not getting the
recognition it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you feel about the whole issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe as an extension of that,
how do you feel about kind of Mac,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, CAP's kind of general unhappiness
with the pricing of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I look at it as anything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only worth as much as you get
somebody to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody is willing to pay it,
then why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, it's sad to look at it
that way, but that's kind of where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: at.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go buy a ten thousand dollar
bottle of wine or I can go buy a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: dollar bottle of wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both probably going to get me just
about as drunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about like the idea
of you wouldn't want, say, one of your
[SPEAKER_02]: strains reaching a certain price point
with the implication being it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like price gouging at that point?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that would be for the farm to
decide at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really, you know, we're a seed
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you buy the seeds, you do with it
what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You find something that people are willing
to pay that much for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, if you can get it,
why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see, I can see both sides of it because,
you know, it seems ridiculous a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars an eighth, but once again,
you don't have to buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel the same in a lot of
regards, like in terms of that pure
[SPEAKER_02]: capital is to be on things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it works in every other market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to wind up being the same in
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, look at how much we,
some Nikes go for, I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even just expensive cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mercedes or a Volvo?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the safest car out there,
but not everybody drives one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's rewind back for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to know what was your first
breeding project and how did you get into
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a friend of mine and I had a house in
Colorado in the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been growing hash plant and doing
quite well with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a hold of some seeds out of
California, of some California red hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we popped the seeds, chose between a
couple of different mouths and used those
[SPEAKER_03]: to pollinate a couple of the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so did you end up growing at the
offspring?
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only wound up getting a couple hundred
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we popped the majority of them,
but didn't necessarily really find
[SPEAKER_03]: anything all that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that maybe is because like
the genetics back then just weren't as
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of refined as they are these days?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I would think they were more,
more so refined.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then now they're a little bit more,
you know, for lack of a better word,
[SPEAKER_03]: bastardized out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, I think that it was, it was a
land race that we get it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the land race was just so dominant
that it overrode the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the hash plant, you know, back then it
was a super fast plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a hash plant that we could take
a clone within a week and have roots and
[SPEAKER_03]: it went right on the flood table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six weeks in the flower, chop it down a
week to dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, we're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in an eight week cycle from cloned to
done, we wanted to find something that
[SPEAKER_03]: would maybe, you know, add a little bit
more to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that wasn't the ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you say hash plant,
is it just like, it's just any old hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plan or is it like a specific one you're
referring to?
[SPEAKER_03]: It came to us as a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, shortly after that is when the
Arcata cut came to us, train rank.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Arcata train rank came to us a little
while after that and we all grew that for
[SPEAKER_03]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the hash plant was what we all
grew for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: 92, 93 ish there in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't suppose it might've been
the Skelly hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very good possibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't suppose you've tried
Skelly more recently since she's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: made her re-emergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I wouldn't have any reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to line that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's insanely fast flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your opinion, you know, do you think it
was truly done that quickly or maybe you
[SPEAKER_02]: were cutting corners a little bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it might've needed to go a little
longer, but we were doing flood tables and
[SPEAKER_03]: pushing everything right along.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple salts in the tanks and ripped and
let her go, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It maybe needed to go seven or eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could totally see that, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you grow organically nowadays or
are you still a salt guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it's all organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we mix most of our soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we use a few things out of a bottle,
but they all say organics on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, you can take that as far
as you can throw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we pay extra for water, obviously,
but, uh, you know, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, we try to stay pretty organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't pay with salts that much,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like it's just kind of a
personal preference thing or do you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's just truly like, you know,
a superior option?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, no, I think, uh, you know,
if you want mass, you're going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: salts.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want flavor, you're going to do
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard some guests in the past argue
that if you kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: really on point, so to speak, you can get
the yields to be quite on par with the
[SPEAKER_02]: hydro guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that's maybe a little bit
stretching the truth or that that is
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll refer back to a peak farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do about two and a half to three a
light with that Dr. Who.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all organic soil that they
create themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's matching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so, you know, I have plenty of
friends that just smash do fantastic on
[SPEAKER_03]: organic soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just think that with a good cocoa
and salt system, you can see 15,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 times a day, you're going to crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's there's no, you know, the more food
you can get it to uptake, the bigger it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basic physics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the issue of growing grow lights,
what are your preferred brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it seems like there's new
technologies ever constantly emerging.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you currently using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we jumped on that Gavita train in
the very beginning and kind of been riding
[SPEAKER_03]: it ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big fan of the Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like just the 1000 double ends or
which ones you rocking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we run the 1000 double ends because
we bought them way back in the beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: before they had the 750s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you use the 750s if you could?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we went to the Gavita 1000s,
we ran 600s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Due to the fact that instead of 6000s,
I would stuff in 10 or 11 or 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: 600s to get to the same point pretty much
was power.
[SPEAKER_03]: So therefore you just have more points of
light and they run a lot cooler so you can
[SPEAKER_03]: run the plants a lot closer or run them a
lot closer to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just to kind of this idea put
forward by DJ Short is that like metal
[SPEAKER_02]: halides brings more flavor, HPS brings
more yield, or maybe it wasn't DJ Short
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, but he's the one who I
remembered bringing it up initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, what type of system do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a mixed, a pure, how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so what I've learned from doing
different mixed spectrum rooms is that a
[SPEAKER_03]: 50-50 is usually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but you'll get certain strains
that under the blue light, they'll show
[SPEAKER_03]: different colors to wear under the halogen
they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you got a bud that's half say pink
hair and the other half of it's white hair
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's getting the metal halide or
it's getting the HPS, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The metal halide though does from blue
light promotes vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you wind up getting a leafier more open
product I feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, a 50-50 mix but now with the
ceramics and all that stuff, I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: played with the ceramics that much but I
see a lot of people throwing those in
[SPEAKER_03]: nowadays as well instead of the metal
halides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, I don't know that flavor-wise
on the blues, probably so just because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's more the cool color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more promoting vegetative growth,
but I don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we kind of just jump back to that
initial story where you had the hash plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and you did the pollination, at that time,
were there any kind of breeders you were
[SPEAKER_02]: looking up to or was everyone just kind of
self-sufficient and keeping to themselves?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty self-sufficient, keeping to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: High times cups had just kind of started
over in Amsterdam, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the big guys at that point
obviously were Greenhouse and Adam Dunn
[SPEAKER_03]: was doing quite well back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Cincy Seeds, there was a few
different seed companies you could get but
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody was too scared to order them
especially out of the back of high times
[SPEAKER_03]: or column.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean that was still back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would get stuff at the grow store and
then go camping for a three-day weekend
[SPEAKER_03]: before we went anywhere kind of thing,
you know, borrow somebody's car,
[SPEAKER_03]: meet them at a campsite to grab your
nutrients and all that stuff that you
[SPEAKER_03]: needed for the next month.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still pretty harsh in the early
90s, late 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was definitely a little bit more to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so did you go to like, you know,
those extra efforts to try to throw the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cops off your trail or did you
kind of always view it as a bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: paranoia?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mind spending time in the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a bonus anyways, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: An excuse to go fishing for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, it was just the way that I
was raised because my father even wants
[SPEAKER_03]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anytime he would order stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We lived in Northern Idaho so the
panhandle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would go over to Spokane to buy all
of our nutrients or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd only go to garden stores,
you know, a long ways away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it was just, it was still,
it was such a paranoid type time for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what was the first cup you ended up
going to yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: The first cup actually, the first
competition I went to was the ONCAs,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon Medicinal Cannabis Awards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually we, we wound up taking first
place at Mad Scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was obviously a bit more recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never went to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been into Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, my first cup was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a small local state thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: First High Times Cup was the first one
that was here in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you ever have, you know,
a lot to do with the following cups
[SPEAKER_02]: afterwards?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have a lot to do with that in
California and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the high time circuit quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did a couple of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, no, mainly just the high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like they, they kind of
helped the scene develop over the years or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe not as much as other avenues,
like say forums or things like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the forums did a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had their place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, once again, I'm not a
computer guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't on the forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know much about the forum life,
but I meet a lot of people now that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: all they're about is forum this and,
you know, I was so and so on this forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of great people that
were on those forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as high times, I think it allowed
an avenue for people to come and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: see everything that they were reading
about and hearing about in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_03]: towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've changed a bit, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about things
nowadays?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Emerald Cup has been a hot topic
in the sense that last year, I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: being at the cup, people were almost
predicting like, you know, it was the last
[SPEAKER_02]: one that'll ever happen and it was all
doom and gloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your forecast for cups going
forward and specifically the Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_02]: this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I've been doing Emerald Cup for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good friends with a lot of those
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be there again this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, it won't be like it was last
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year was the last cup of the free
will of where you could freely bust out
[SPEAKER_03]: and do pretty much kind of what you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not happening anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's all regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not licensed, if you're not from
a nursery, there's all kinds of things
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have to be even to be able to get
the booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's going to be a little
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's, you know, once again,
there's always loopholes around
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I just mentioned, we will most likely,
we will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that we're talking with Jinx
Proof about sharing a booth with them
[SPEAKER_03]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was going to be my question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you have your own booth or just be
represented with Seeds here now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't spoken with James, but most
likely Seeds here now does a fantastic
[SPEAKER_03]: showing at those.
[SPEAKER_03]: We normally like to have our own booths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that way we get a little bit of time
to talk to the people that are supporting
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, it's sometimes nice just
to let James and his crew do their job and
[SPEAKER_03]: just go and have fun and enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jinx Proof just hit me up here in the
last week and was talking to me about
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of a new development that
we're in talks about right at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember last year I cruised past your
booth a few times and every time you were
[SPEAKER_02]: locked in a conversation, is that what it
feels like to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is, that's why I love doing
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that I can get locked into
conversations with the supporters because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's great to hear what they think or what
they're doing or how it's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just hear the stories of
how your strains did for them for the
[SPEAKER_03]: following, the prior year or the future of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, you know, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's kind of nice to do your
booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way people can come and talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how often is it that someone will come
by the booth and bring you a sample of
[SPEAKER_02]: your work and you're like really blown
away by it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most shows, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I've slowed down on doing
shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Emerald Cup is the only one we're
pretty much doing this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, now there's some amazing
growers out there and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to think that we're providing
them with some fantastic genetics to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really nice to get something back
that just is like, wow, that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, on the topic of providing
genetics, how do you feel when people want
[SPEAKER_02]: to breed with your work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like you're all cool with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just like maybe give me a little
hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what's your stance on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's something that I don't want the
public to have and or work with,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't release it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have lots of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's, you know, so it's more of an
honor and a privilege for somebody to use
[SPEAKER_03]: your genetics in something because it
takes a lot of time to do to create
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics and test them out and,
you know, and having a vision of where
[SPEAKER_03]: you're wanting to go with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that works in somebody else's head
and it's one of our genetics, that's
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, always, you know, a head nod's
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we kind of jump back to the
Emerald Cup for just one last second,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you ever get a chance to cruise around
with the intention of trying to find like
[SPEAKER_02]: eye off what the next kind of trend is or
like find some new hot breeders or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: find it's just too chaotic to really be
able to do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, it's pretty chaotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely a lot of good new
breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always is, always will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of chaotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we create so much that for us to
pop somebody else's genetics at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point, except for at a client's facility,
becomes rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to put you on the grill for a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you've got to do it imaginatively
because you're not able to in real life or
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it is the real life answer,
let's just say for your personal grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to pop a pack of seeds,
you know, just one pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it going to be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quantum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I pop quantum everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, do you like to find new keepers
of things or do you like to hold on to old
[SPEAKER_02]: keepers?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if there are strains that we
created, yeah, in and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we find something that's
special, we'll have it tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if our thoughts are right,
then it is special, then we may hold on to
[SPEAKER_03]: it for future progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the time, yeah, we've got a
whole bunch of moms in the library
[SPEAKER_03]: already.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need to keep a bunch of stuff we
make in C-form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, that's a good answer if
you've got that much confidence in the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it true?
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be wrong, but I think I'm right
that Geek Mike actually found that cut out
[SPEAKER_02]: of just a single five seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave him a five pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wound up getting five females and that
wasn't even the best female out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: five pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said the best one didn't clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you know, he got fairly lucky not
everybody has that, you know, gets that
[SPEAKER_03]: luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, that tells me that somebody
out there got a five pack of males.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it is probably a breeder and
they were probably stoked.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to loop back a while
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that, like, you know,
Sensi were the people advertising in high
[SPEAKER_02]: times and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always interested to know,
what's your opinions on Sensi in regards
[SPEAKER_02]: to, like, when and why do you think they
went to shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so they crossbred out too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just got they also subbed
everything out to people in Spain or
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere else to make their seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can go to Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sitting on five gallon buckets
full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll sell you all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just big old totes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy them by the tens of thousands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they really what they are or are they
something different?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's kind of what crushed
them a little bit was once they went to
[SPEAKER_03]: that model, they kind of lost control of
what they were actually getting back in
[SPEAKER_03]: seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw a post a few months back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I remember who it was, because if
you're not familiar with this post,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would totally allow us to go look at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, someone in the community
posted that they had a plant they were
[SPEAKER_02]: calling Kush 4 and they were saying that
it was one of the supposed parents of the
[SPEAKER_02]: original Hindu Kush offered by Sensi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just got me thinking, like,
do you think it's even possible that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, a parent that, like, Sensi was
breeding with, do you think, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: realistically, it's possible that a parent
like that is even around anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is not the whole implied point of the
last question that, like, those parents
[SPEAKER_02]: are gone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those parents are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was a couple of raids in
between those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that a lot of them got kept
down by little boys in blue kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, a lot of people that all of
a sudden reappear and say, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we'll never really know because
everybody's opinion is always changing and
[SPEAKER_03]: you always have new reference points.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we kind of fast forward to today,
seen, I feel like it's categorized
[SPEAKER_02]: predominantly by like a terpene or like a
flavor emphasis in this modern era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you feel like it's still
predominantly a potency emphasis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Within connoisseurs, it's definitely
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within the market cells, it's potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like with that being said, how do you
feel the CBD is going to work considering
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, there is this emphasis on
potency and CBD strains, generally
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking, kind of lacking in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like CBD is on the way out,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think CBD is on its way out,
but not because of that reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some friends that do some fantastic
CBD work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all the way up to 25 to 26% CBD
with no THC and then flavors of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: rainbow, skunks, fruits, lemons,
oranges, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's other things on the horizon
that I feel that are going to interrupt
[SPEAKER_03]: the CBD program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you care to shine a little light on
those things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently here in America, CBD was taken
off of scheduling and now has received a
[SPEAKER_03]: FDA approval for a specific pharmaceutical
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they can sell you CBD derived from
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prescription wise through your doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still talking about it and if
insurance will cover it or not,
[SPEAKER_03]: but most likely it will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to gouge people and
yeah, but now it's going to be legal and
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you think that, yeah, just
controlling interests will try to
[SPEAKER_02]: implement some legal changes so that it's
just not being produced outside of them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would be concerned with is if all
of a sudden they came back and made it a
[SPEAKER_03]: schedule two, which schedule twos can only
be made by pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would take care of it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like that would just also
be a stepping stone to then do the same
[SPEAKER_02]: with THC afterwards?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to happen with
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many people like smoking the flowers
and the concentrates just freshly derived.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most CBD is taken in pill form,
tincture form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it kind of lends itself to the
pharmaceutical model a little more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's an isolated molecule,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The bad part is, is that we now,
you know, we've known for a while that you
[SPEAKER_03]: need CBD along with THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're still going to be depriving
their patients of what they truly need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you know, we all know the same
is true for the opposite end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum with the whole drobinol thing and
the pure THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was no good either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, if we're on the topic of
interesting cannabinoid profiles,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a nice little question for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've worked with like some CBD lines
before, notably the one that caught my eye
[SPEAKER_02]: was the Canisoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing which I noticed about this
is you crossed it with a THC male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to end up with like a,
like, you know, a hybrid type of end
[SPEAKER_02]: product where it's some THC, some CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously there'd be some variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that these lines in general
fare well in the market or they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: really not received to the same degree
that say a regular THC line is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not, they're not, they're not as
marketable as a regular THC strain is,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though the, the one you're talking
about is our Canarec, Canisoo by Timerec.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has two to one to one to two CBD
being first.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it, it added a whole lot of
structure and bigger buds to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canisoo itself was pretty larky and lay
out, laid out, didn't really stand up and
[SPEAKER_03]: grew fairly ugly and really small buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hit it to our, with our Timerec male
that increases bud sizes, adds strength
[SPEAKER_03]: within stem and potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really didn't know what to expect
there, but it wound up turning out all
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hit it anywhere from 13, 14% CBD to,
you know, half that and THC or vice versa,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that and THC with four or 5%
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you talk to your customers who
grow out these crosses, generally
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking, what do you find is their
preference in regards to the Keeper
[SPEAKER_02]: phenos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they the more THC dominant phenos or
the more CBD dominant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are more CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, CBD is a unique cannabinoid
that, cannabinoid that matures early.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it has too much THC, just pull it a
little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll still be higher CBD with lower THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I explained that to them
when they're, when they're looking for the
[SPEAKER_03]: right ratio of what's going to work best
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you find that one thing I've
heard is this complaint of a lot of CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: strains or the pure ones, at least having
this common denominator terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_02]: which some would describe as cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you found that yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old, the older CBDs, when you extract
them, they all taste like cherry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how, you know, it was always
well known that you were hitting the CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays I would, you know, but they're
all hybrids, you know, we've hit them with
[SPEAKER_03]: other things and then outcrossed them
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just to pull certain
terpene profiles to get to the flower to
[SPEAKER_03]: where people hopefully would want to smoke
the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this idea I've been kicking around
for a while, you know, I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an interesting idea is like
embedding kind of a little bit of CBD in
[SPEAKER_02]: the back of what we would regard as
regular strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of strains out there
which do this where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe there's like two, two and a half,
3% CBD, you know, it's just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hiding in the background,
but enough to actually do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is like, you can
subconsciously, you know, get some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those benefits into people without them
knowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully eventually people start
to give it a bit more credence.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about that idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think like it could ever possibly
work or there's just maybe some issues
[SPEAKER_02]: with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it could possibly work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously I've definitely agree the more
cannabinoids and terpenes you have,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more effective all the medicine is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really just comes down to what works
best for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's the great thing about
cannabis is it's so diverse that
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually you'll find one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I don't know how,
I don't know if that's enough to get
[SPEAKER_03]: people to want to try CBD more or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that some of these more
rare terpene profiles are the way of the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember reading in some of your
strains, you're getting CVG and CVC
[SPEAKER_02]: showing up, you know, some of these more
kind of exotic ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that is the way of the
future or it's just kind of like a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: tidbit that's probably going to go by and
we won't talk too much about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I think that rare cannabinoids
is definitely going to be a big thing
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that we're working with is THCV and
the CVC, our Quantum Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: We find good amounts of that, both of
those in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I consider good amounts is 2% plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: The highest we've seen so far is 3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see a lot below 2%.
[SPEAKER_03]: In between that 2% to 3%, we see quite a
bit as far as THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: CVC, 1%, 1.5% as far as THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much the highest that I've
seen, but with the new technologies we
[SPEAKER_03]: have, it makes it a lot easier to know if
it's transferring in the process the way
[SPEAKER_03]: we want it to, or if it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think some of this curiosity stemmed
initially from reading some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: information around TARDIS, specifically
where it said there's been some research
[SPEAKER_02]: indicating that some of the profile of the
cannabinoids has got tumor-fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this something you guys looked into a
lot, or is it just a peripheral thing you
[SPEAKER_02]: noted?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just more of a peripheral thing we noted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was fortunate enough to work with a
really good lab in Oregon for a long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they worked with me and educated me a
lot on what we had, and explained to us
[SPEAKER_03]: how special some of our crosses were.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the witch intrigued us to figure out,
well, what's bringing those to the table?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's intrigued us to more testing and
more learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I followed them a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have several years' worth of lab results
on a lot of our strains, full terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles and full cannabinoid profiles,
all from the same lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it definitely has helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think now if we can find a genomic one
that works well, that could even help even
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about phylos?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so phylos, I've been involved
with them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunny Chiba and I worked on the seed laws
in Oregon when we went recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we met, we were introduced to phylos
at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've dealt with Mowgli for quite some
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have several of our strains in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted us to put in specific
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, no, I'm gonna put in moms
and dads.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way any of our crosses can be traced
right back to the mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all our males and most of our breeding
moms are in the phylos library.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did that a while ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, we've been talking with them
and what not's quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The information that they give you is kind
of eh, not really clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a common feedback I've heard is that
there is this kind of, there's a degree of
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to operate within the universe and
how to like actually understand things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that is something they
should really be focusing on trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think that it's just like a
learning curve people need to adapt to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so what they're doing is they're
doing a short path.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from my understanding, I'm not a big
science guy and I'm not good with big
[SPEAKER_03]: words, but they're doing a short path
technique, which is just breaking it down
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a long path technique,
which I know there's a company out of
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've ran a few of our strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually were the ones that informed
me that in our quantum kush, we have
[SPEAKER_03]: Russian rudorelia, Russian hemp,
sorry, Russian hemp, which provided
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently in this specific phenome Russet
mite resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found this plant that didn't seem to
have hardly any Russet mites on it when
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else was infected really bad,
turned out to be a quantum kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they went ahead and ran a long path on
it and found out that it had Russian hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: in its lineage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of the conclusion that
they came to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that there's definitely ones,
certain ways that they could get us the
[SPEAKER_03]: information that we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just don't know that Phylos is doing
that for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people, are kind of a bit
skeptical of the idea that by getting your
[SPEAKER_02]: samples done at Phylos, they're now kind
of in the open domain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about things in a
legal sense as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you believe that is the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I find it still hard to get a clear
answer on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so there's some people out there
already that they did some utility patents
[SPEAKER_03]: and they got them and they covered such a
wide array.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wide array of cannabinoid and terpene
profile that it covers a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to protect us from people patenting
plants, first off, it's kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: patent a plant because there's so much
variety in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in IBLs, when I pop seeds of IBLs,
there's still varieties in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's an issue there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with CRISPR systems coming and stuff
like that, it's possible to do it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But will it protect us in the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so, kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: But does that include like offspring from
what's in the galaxy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that, does all of a sudden offspring
now become open when you shouldn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: made that without this to begin with?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how all that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just loop back for one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the Russian hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that not kind of have something to be
said for the ruderalis genetics and how
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes they're just brushed to the
side?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I think obviously
everything has a good purpose to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will, as a land race, will create
resistance to whatever the pest is and
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do still have to remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's definitely adapts very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that there's most likely some
traits there that are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that on actual ruderalis
coming up out, it's very, it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: headache pot from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, have you heard of any of the
more modern companies doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of them are certainly getting
really good reviews.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I say this right, but Manchester
genetics, they kill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's definitely a few
companies out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The auto flower game is doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people still, it's a huge market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people, that's what
they prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of photo period, we'll jump
off the autos for a sec.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know, what do you think is the
absolute longest photo period strain that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be commercially viable?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think if you're commercially,
if you're pushing 11 or 12 weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're kind of, you're kind of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that more what you're asking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is what flower time or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, and that's where
you come into the market, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will, so a company that can put out
strains in an eight week cycle is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get six cycles per year, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and a company that's doing them every
12 weeks is only going to get three and
[SPEAKER_03]: three and a half cycles a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somewhere it has to equal out to pay
all the bills because no matter what,
[SPEAKER_03]: you ain't growing it for free and you're
paying a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the market will allow it,
I can see it going longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really kind of depends on what the
market demands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do you predict to be the next
big thing the market demands?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is changing so rapidly right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, it's really hard to say,
you know, it's so, it's so, I hate to say
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but more or less unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that eight, nine weeks is kind of
where the market's going to have to stay
[SPEAKER_03]: to be competitive, at least on a large
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think then that if something as
in maybe a strain would come in and be
[SPEAKER_02]: that next game changer slash paradigm
shift, it would essentially be confined to
[SPEAKER_02]: those flowering times?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know that, you know,
there's always a new hype strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to have the next best biggest
thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you feel like the market is still
dominated by numbers in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: percentages or do you think that that's
kind of fallen off of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it's definitely still,
still by percentages all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: People walk in and what's the strongest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every shop owner I know will tell you
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've spoken to a few readers in the
past and they said if they make some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, generally, even if they love it,
if it's not testing above say 20,
[SPEAKER_02]: 22%, they're just not even going to
consider it for release.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you sit in the same boat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the market is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're pushing strains out that are
below 20%, they're going to sit on the
[SPEAKER_03]: shelf for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be all concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so are these the type of things that
are in the forefront of your mind as a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder or are you more considering other
attributes like flavor and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't concern myself with all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been about more medicinal
effect and flavors, kind of what we like,
[SPEAKER_03]: what everybody else likes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we like really doesn't matter as much
but what everybody else likes and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's kind of where we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hype thing is cool and all but yeah,
we don't do a lot of work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the new hype strains or anything to that
effect just because of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really not into that hype thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does it take for you to bring a
new clone into the library then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally it has to be an old cut that I've
been looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point in time, I've got pretty
much what I want to play with and now it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just reworking itself upon itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it begs the question, are there any old
school cuts you would love to get but you
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't think they're around anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, obviously the roadkill or whatever
as we discussed before whatever that may
[SPEAKER_03]: have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm privileged enough to where most
the breeders I can ask them and get access
[SPEAKER_03]: to pretty much whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having that accessibility frees it up a
little bit to allow us to play a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we have a lot of classes that
we've done and have not released just
[SPEAKER_03]: because we felt that they were really
good, too good that we didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: release them or obviously they weren't
good enough but yeah, access to cuts for
[SPEAKER_03]: us is pretty easy fortunately enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd have to say not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like you're a very lucky man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely consider myself that to
be absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my last little question in regards to
testing and things around that nature is
[SPEAKER_02]: have you ever considered or do you
currently engage in some of those kits
[SPEAKER_02]: which are now offered by the labs in
regards to early cannabinoid profile
[SPEAKER_02]: testing and early sex testing and things
like that or are you just old school?
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely don't do the sex testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super old school with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plan is going to tell you in a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as cannabinoid ratios and stuff
like that, that's more for CBD guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned before, my buddy too and
then my other friend, Adam Jocks,
[SPEAKER_03]: they both use those and it allows them to
cruise through their stock really fast but
[SPEAKER_03]: they're popping thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can see where that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing thousands of seeds as well but
I'm fairly old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I like to see what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean you mentioned CRISPR and CRISPR
is some cool technology, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of can hint to the past of some
things but one thing it's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell us is who picked that time rec male?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it your sub cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get into it, let's go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you first meet sub?
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew it was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I knew it was coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually I originally first met
Dioxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was manager at a growth store where I
lived.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time that I met sub cool,
Dioxide brought him out to my house to see
[SPEAKER_03]: my Oregon diesel in my backyard that was
done in September, first week of
[SPEAKER_03]: September.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time he was ever at my
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had never heard of TGA before Dioxide or
any of that but throughout the time that I
[SPEAKER_03]: had met Dioxide and before the sub came
out, had given me a lot of packs to pop
[SPEAKER_03]: and we popped them all so when they came
out we had a room full of all their
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics in full flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and that was the first time that I
met him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after that you know they Dioxide kind
of talked to me and we talked for a while
[SPEAKER_03]: about him about us producing seeds on a
larger scale and then distributing them
[SPEAKER_03]: for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like sounds like it could be
fun, sure let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of how that history went.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the tester strains that we did back
then for them was Dioxide's creation of
[SPEAKER_03]: time wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even before I was obviously a tester so
we popped some.
[SPEAKER_03]: My son Donovan found a male that he liked
a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The branching came up with a couple inches
from the top including the bottom
[SPEAKER_03]: branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the branches have beautiful structure,
great smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked with Dioxide if we could use it
for some crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mush Mouth described to him what he wanted
to do and the line that he wanted to go
[SPEAKER_03]: through and Dioxide said absolutely not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of where we started with
the Dr. Who and the quantum and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mickey.
[SPEAKER_03]: The JTR male actually came to us through
Dioxide as well and that was to do some
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the medicine woman which was a
strain created by a gentleman there in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon for his wife's fiber mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted us to cross the Jack the
Ripper to the medicine woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was nurse Jackie.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of our first releases as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout that time we started doing cups
started working with seven moved to
[SPEAKER_03]: California by that point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really hung out with him or talk
with him much other than on the phone or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: My main person with TGA with Dioxide
helped him with the soil company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But worked a lot of the cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sons and I ran the booth for several
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bring in a crew we would set up the
booth and tear down the booth and run the
[SPEAKER_03]: booth and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were back in the good old days when
Heroes of the Farm joined in and he was
[SPEAKER_03]: making stuff with Dioxide as well and that
was the Heroes of the Farm collab thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once that got going then Pat's like hey
do you mind if I use the time wrecked male
[SPEAKER_03]: to do some crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like yeah sure no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we worked out a collaboration and all
that kind of stuff and he went ahead and
[SPEAKER_03]: used the time wrecked male and that's the
locomotion and a few of those other ones
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our time wrecked male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah so as far as the male the time
wrecked male yeah no it was not found by
[SPEAKER_03]: sub it was found by my son Donovan and it
was while it was in testing mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got permission we talked to Dioxide
about it beforehand and yeah everything
[SPEAKER_03]: was good gravy and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know now that sub likes to claim that he
gave it to me and that he found it and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that good stuff but yeah that's far from
the truth unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think he wants to take credit
for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm not really quite sure I would
think you know as I explained earlier with
[SPEAKER_03]: people using our genetics for strength for
making stuff I feel privileged and honored
[SPEAKER_03]: about it if they mention this school if
they don't cool either way they paid the
[SPEAKER_03]: money from the seed that I was offering
they bought their goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think right now the biggest issue is
that he has got himself into some places
[SPEAKER_03]: where he went bragging that they were all
his and he owned all this and he owned all
[SPEAKER_03]: that when he doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never grew that time wrecked male he's
never seen grown any of the stuff that we
[SPEAKER_03]: make.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with Pat the same with Heroes of the
Farm same with King's Proof you know
[SPEAKER_03]: there's there's been some of I hang out
now with Sonny Chiba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonny Chiba was the original person that
helped Miss Jill bring sub cool to the
[SPEAKER_03]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the one that created Doja,
Black Cherry, Black Cherry Soda,
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon Freeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole list goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he get credit for him?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very rarely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that Miss Jill and sub are separated
Miss Jill has actually come out and
[SPEAKER_03]: explained a lot of the truths and I really
I appreciate that and I love her for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point in time she was part of the
issue but she's changed and has you know
[SPEAKER_03]: come full circle as far as I'm concerned
as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would give sub more credit because he is
a great man he has done a lot for the
[SPEAKER_03]: community and he did definitely help us in
marketing and what nots to that effect but
[SPEAKER_03]: that was part of the agreement that was
part of the distribution agreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we put their names on the back
of our covers you know we all had a little
[SPEAKER_03]: TGA little circle on the very back of our
covers up in the top corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our names are on the front they're
all of our strains so why he sits there
[SPEAKER_03]: and says that he claims the creation of
all them and this and that I really don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same that he tells people that he
taught me how to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah my father heard that and was kind of
like really so he was around when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like no he wasn't you know that but
at any rate people believe what they want
[SPEAKER_03]: to believe and I'm okay with that I don't
try to defend it I don't come out and talk
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of trash or anything like that
about sub pool and I won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some issues and yeah that was it
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was it ultimately which catalyzed
the decision for you to part ways?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what it came down to is they brought in
another group that was starting to run the
[SPEAKER_03]: cup they were extremely rude to me and my
children me and my boys that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: running the shows for years and the next
show coming up was the Denver show and I
[SPEAKER_03]: asked him I was like so I think for the
Denver show I just rather do my own booth
[SPEAKER_03]: and he freaked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like well you know this is what it
comes down to is you have our seeds being
[SPEAKER_03]: sold all over the place and other booths
throughout the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see why it's a big deal that I
have our own booth and we sell our own
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He couldn't see it and I said okay well
then that's it we're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean it seems pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you know we all had the same
agreement so he wrote the farm would bring
[SPEAKER_03]: a set amount of seeds, I bring a set
amount of seeds, James could bring a set
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would sell all the seeds we'd split
everything equally pay all the help and go
[SPEAKER_03]: our separate ways after each show after
everything was covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I've heard ridiculous things come
from him as far as like I paid him $40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: a show to do this and he never paid me
that we never made that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had one show in LA one year or San
Bernardino one year where we did over
[SPEAKER_03]: $40,000 only one and yeah I didn't give it
all but far from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean I could sit here and go on
about a whole bunch of different stories
[SPEAKER_03]: but what it comes down to is we definitely
just didn't see eye to eye on where I
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to go and what I wanted to do and
she was unmoving and willing to move and
[SPEAKER_03]: compromise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it's interesting you made that
comment about Sonny Cheever's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: A sentiment we've heard in the past is
that you know some of the best work to
[SPEAKER_02]: ever come out of TGA was from the Canadian
crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you kind of echo that sentiment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I don't know what work came out of
the Canadian crew because that was all in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I think they're pretty much just
referring to Sonny Cheever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Sonny Cheever was Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah it wasn't Canadian at all he was
their important Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go and a final little thing I
wanted to quickly ask you about this
[SPEAKER_02]: Dioxide's an interesting character to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gonna sound like a weird question
but I had to ask it because I had always
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm familiar with him through his
involvement with the Chernobyl and I love
[SPEAKER_02]: it you know it's super energetic really
gorgeous high I love it I've got a really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice keeper I found and I can't remember
who told me but someone was like oh man
[SPEAKER_02]: you should meet Dioxide like he's like
real high energy like he makes weed like
[SPEAKER_02]: his personality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that to be true or is that
just some random story I got told?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you know he's pretty hyped up most
the time he's pretty kicked back though
[SPEAKER_03]: he's fairly level-headed as far as I was
concerned he definitely made the best
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that TGA offered as far as the TGA
company him and sub as partners you know
[SPEAKER_03]: he's the one that found the JTR mal he he
made he I watched him go through a
[SPEAKER_03]: three-year search of cushions before he
decided to use the Hell's OG to make the
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus you know so I mean he was definitely
really into what he was doing and he was
[SPEAKER_03]: really good at it but yeah as soon as it
wasn't long after him and sub split up the
[SPEAKER_03]: sub and I split up as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay so do you feel like it's a bit
of a weird situation given that you do use
[SPEAKER_02]: that Jack the Ripper mal or you think like
not really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually we don't use it anymore we
haven't used it for years we were the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that gave it back to so after Dioxide did
all the breeding so after Dioxide and sub
[SPEAKER_03]: separated sub did not have the JTR mal so
he had to hound me for it and hound me for
[SPEAKER_03]: it and I kept telling Dioxide I'm like hey
man he's bugging me again for that JTR
[SPEAKER_03]: mal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dioxide finally tells me he's like hey I
put you in a really bad situation here go
[SPEAKER_03]: ahead and give it to him so it was at that
point in time that I took the JTR mal back
[SPEAKER_03]: to sub.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bred with it one more time after that
and that was it I knew that our
[SPEAKER_03]: separations were coming and that was their
mal that they had picked from their
[SPEAKER_03]: company so yeah I didn't want to use it
that was theirs I get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The time rack yeah no we found that we
take claim to it it is ours made by
[SPEAKER_03]: Dioxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure so final little question on
the whole side I've asked this to some
[SPEAKER_02]: other people because this seems to be I'm
not gonna say a common occurrence but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not you know you guys certainly aren't the
only example but you know do you feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of in a sense you would like things
to be you know cool given that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: some of that work is embedded within your
own work even if it's not a direct
[SPEAKER_02]: descendant it's kind of almost like a
little bit of a tipping of the hat given
[SPEAKER_02]: that it is embedded in there how do you
feel about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not have I don't have a problem
giving Dioxide credit any day yeah cool
[SPEAKER_03]: cool easy answer yeah no absolutely easy
all sub is is a salesman he doesn't breed
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah that's all there is to it he made
he did at one point in time but once he
[SPEAKER_03]: got to Dioxide once Dioxide came in that
was it after Dioxide left he talked to me
[SPEAKER_03]: about doing all his breeding that didn't
happen so he went to Joel Northstar
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics which is who makes it all now and
I've been to Joel's place so I know what
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of breeding he does there and when
people sat there for the last three years
[SPEAKER_03]: after I left and come up to me and say hey
the seeds that I bought from TGA last year
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't what I had got the year before
what happened I couldn't answer even
[SPEAKER_03]: though I know what happened but I still
wouldn't answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that to do with like the issue that
Miss Jill was pointing out with males
[SPEAKER_02]: being lost and replaced?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah when I spoke to sub about that he
said that what had happened was the person
[SPEAKER_02]: who had sent the cuttings in made a
mistake and took five cuttings of the same
[SPEAKER_02]: plant seemed like an interesting answer
though maybe a little hard to swallow what
[SPEAKER_02]: did you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not no yeah that they don't
that just goes to show the kind of how
[SPEAKER_03]: they how he does everything he relies upon
everybody else to do everything so once
[SPEAKER_03]: something goes wrong it's a blame on
somebody else it's never a fault that he
[SPEAKER_03]: ever made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay I had a good friend send me this
question to ask you so hopefully you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have more idea about it than what I
do because I had no idea what this means
[SPEAKER_02]: at the moment but he said the time wreck
he got from dioxide was it a female except
[SPEAKER_02]: only one branch that hermied?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah absolutely so yeah some of the
genetics that could put out of there have
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphidation results so more or less if
just one branch did it though I would look
[SPEAKER_03]: more towards a light leak of some sort
around that branch but it is definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: possible they have some stuff that you
know the JTR male the space dude which if
[SPEAKER_03]: you ever get if you ever get Sonny on here
maybe he'll explain to you about the space
[SPEAKER_03]: dude story but it's you know it's a super
cross of multiple things you know and as
[SPEAKER_03]: you continue to cross it it's super
unstable so it creates unstable genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay and so I think he had a bit of a
follow-up and he says do you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: this accounts for the occurrence of
hermaphrodisms in nature?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I think it more so comes from
stressing of meshed together genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay I think I kind of get what he's
getting at now given your answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right some stress in the plant out to
where it's getting the signal that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna die cannabis is fortunate enough to
be able to produce both male and female
[SPEAKER_03]: sex organisms and reproduce itself so when
it hits a point to where either a light
[SPEAKER_03]: leak or the gases are off or something
that it doesn't like or something that
[SPEAKER_03]: stresses it it's gonna cause it
hermaphrodite which is produced both parts
[SPEAKER_03]: so that it can pollinate and produce
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: To continue to live once again it is a
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay so on the topic of producing
seeds are there any little extra perks or
[SPEAKER_02]: a little kind of icing on the cake you
like to give to your female plants when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're creating seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just yeah you just kind of treat it
like it's a sensei crop except the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm yeah I will different seeding
right I don't want to private of nitrogens
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's it's no different than a
female that gets pregnant they need
[SPEAKER_03]: prenatals they need different nutrients
than what you're given a regular flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: plant at least in my opinion and that's
personal you know and that's they're
[SPEAKER_03]: probably gonna be a bunch of people say oh
you're just crazy possibly I could be but
[SPEAKER_03]: it works for me and I'm happy with it that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool and have you ever noticed a
difference in the end outcome of a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the different medium or nutrients
it's being fed or do you think overall
[SPEAKER_02]: it's same same?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've pretty much used the exact same
soils and the same nutrients for the last
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 years 12 years so most of our breeding
has been done on the same regimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay I mean maybe to play devil's
advocate I don't suppose you've ever seen
[SPEAKER_02]: like a bit of a questionable grow or maybe
a better way to phrase it is you pop some
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and got some you know some funky
German germination ratios or some bad
[SPEAKER_02]: germination ratings and then maybe you
went and saw the grower and you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't too impressed by this setup and
you're like this is maybe why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah no absolutely we germ test
germination test all of our seeds I have
[SPEAKER_03]: we make our seeds fresh every year we
don't like them to sit we do small batch
[SPEAKER_03]: and that that's the reason why because
I've fresh seeds are way better than
[SPEAKER_03]: five-year-old seeds they're gonna have a
better germination rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know we don't really seem to have
problems with it so when people call me or
[SPEAKER_03]: contact me with that issue I have a set of
questions that I run through with them and
[SPEAKER_03]: normally it's something on their end and
we usually send them back out back and the
[SPEAKER_03]: next round they usually don't have the
same problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay that's a good little answer so
going back to a bit earlier you mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: the medicine woman that was an interesting
one I wanted to ask you about but
[SPEAKER_02]: thankfully you filled us in on the
backstory but I also had written down the
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet Irish Kush this is another one where
you use it not a whole hell of a lot of a
[SPEAKER_02]: backstory on it would you mind filling us
in a little more about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah so sweet Irish Kush was created by my
friend that I was living with in the 90s
[SPEAKER_03]: when we did the Ashland cross he continued
to do more breeding throughout his time
[SPEAKER_03]: but sweet Irish Kush was one that he
created and he's a hydro guy Colorado's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of hydro especially back in 90s 2000s
so it's a fairly quick strain it's a 92
[SPEAKER_03]: it's an oat so hit from here it's an OG by
sweet leaf so that's the cross when we put
[SPEAKER_03]: it through phylos it came back 50% OG and
you know a few other things here and there
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah it's 50% OG so but it's a it's an
old one because he created it in late 90s
[SPEAKER_03]: 96 97 I believe something like that and
I've had it I brought it to Oregon with me
[SPEAKER_03]: and I brought it back up 0405.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how does she compare to say you
more typical OGs like say maybe the SFV
[SPEAKER_02]: which she mentioned at the start?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know sweet Irish Kush is one of my
favorites I really like that a lot it has
[SPEAKER_03]: a fantastic high at test 25 27 percent
pretty consistently it's a fast strain
[SPEAKER_03]: once again he was into the fast strains
for the hydro systems we did lap tests on
[SPEAKER_03]: her six weeks seven weeks eight weeks nine
weeks and ten weeks six week was our
[SPEAKER_03]: highest THC and degraded from there on
down but it was fast it's fast in veg it's
[SPEAKER_03]: fast in flour and it's kind of ugly to
grow it's all over the place so it's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like a typical older OG where it's
floppy and skinnier branch but it produces
[SPEAKER_03]: fairly well for as fast as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting and what's kind of the flavor
profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just straight OG?
[SPEAKER_03]: No it's a really sweet OG to be honest it
really sweet with a bit of a funk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay so the other strain I mean
there's a few I want to ask you about but
[SPEAKER_02]: one which really caught my Oregon blues
and the part about it which caught my eye
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically was how it uses what you say
is the in-house IVL Jamaican blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa what is that you know because like
when I first read it I was thinking is he
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of talking about like a Dutch
acclimatized Jamaican type of thing or
[SPEAKER_02]: just straight land race?
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight IVL from a plantation in Jamaica
in the Blue Mountains they've been growing
[SPEAKER_03]: it there for generations a friend of mine
brought me back seeds and anything that it
[SPEAKER_03]: touches it passes strong blueberries to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bad part about it is it's an IVL and
it's very dominant so you see a lot of it
[SPEAKER_03]: for generations out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still playing with it a little
bit but yeah that is the so the Blue
[SPEAKER_03]: Mountain Kush is a that was the one you
asked about right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Oregon blues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon diesel by the Jamaican that you
either get so we have some a few phenos we
[SPEAKER_03]: found that are really like I want to say
cat pissy you know very ammonia but then a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of really blueberry you know so that
one was it was definitely different it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not one that we put out to market because
we didn't feel that it was up to par as of
[SPEAKER_03]: that you know at this point but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay so what to you would be the ideal
mating partner for the Jamaican?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know yet whatever it is it's going
to be a few crosses out just because as I
[SPEAKER_03]: say the Jamaican is super strong and it's
not necessarily it's what you would think
[SPEAKER_03]: of when you think of a land race it's very
airy it's very loose buds it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: stretchy it's you know it has a few
different thing characteristics that don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily make it very viable viable in
a market that we have today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay and so the next question is
stimulated in my mind was this idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: different blueberry origins because I
remember when I was looking up some
[SPEAKER_02]: information on the infamous Vic High he
claimed he had blueberry that was of
[SPEAKER_02]: different origin to DJ Short and I guess
that was the first place I started to
[SPEAKER_02]: think like was there multiple sources of
blueberry or did it all come from DJ
[SPEAKER_02]: Short?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your feelings on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know from talking so I'm friends with
DJ he's one of my favorite people to sit
[SPEAKER_03]: down and talk with actually one of the one
of the old guys that I really enjoy
[SPEAKER_03]: talking with but yeah Vic High from my
understanding took his blueberry and said
[SPEAKER_03]: he was gonna make it better so yeah I
would almost have to say was probably more
[SPEAKER_03]: so from DJ than I would Vic but I wasn't
around back then so I who knows for sure
[SPEAKER_03]: right you'd have to get both of them in to
find out you know who was first and where
[SPEAKER_03]: did you source it from kind of a thing but
according to DJ it's a Jamaican thing so
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah okay there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it also brings up this next question in
my mind and you kind of referenced it at
[SPEAKER_02]: the very start of extremely isolated
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the reason why I think tangy and
blueberry and a few other notable ones
[SPEAKER_02]: have got such traction is because they're
such dead ringers for this isolated
[SPEAKER_02]: specific profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that is maybe something
you could aim for as a breeder if you were
[SPEAKER_02]: like well if I can you know if I 've got a
strain and it kind of smells like
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberries and I can refine it to the
point where it's just bang on raspberries
[SPEAKER_02]: like that'd just be a market winner or do
you think that it's just that would be an
[SPEAKER_02]: oversimplification of things?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I think it almost but it's kind
of an oversimplification but I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: need the variety and being humans as we
are we all want different so just a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit different or a lot different is
definitely dependent upon the person but
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah you know you not everybody can get
the right fruit combinations and once
[SPEAKER_03]: again it's what pairs up together what
lines up together you know I've smelled
[SPEAKER_03]: several different strains that smell a lot
like our grape high chief you know of our
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Who but once you get into smoking I
mean you look at the bud structure there's
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know I don't know that's I guess
you know it'd be nice to find the ultimate
[SPEAKER_03]: one but I don't know if it truly exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the flavor profile that you wish
you had in cannabis form?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we've had we have flavors from
dirt to watermelon to rotten fruit to ripe
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit to suly to cat piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them all kind of just depends on
what kind of mood I'm in or what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: getting ready to do or who I'm getting
ready to go hang out with.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've always been a group that we like to
grow a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah perfect segue what type of weed is
your favorite weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Flowers any and all you know obviously
right at the moment I have some two
[SPEAKER_03]: different kinds of Dr. Who in my stash
I've got some scooby snacks some dog
[SPEAKER_03]: walker some gorilla glue some Wi-Fi some
banner number five Bruce Banner number
[SPEAKER_03]: five I mean right at the moment I've got a
whole slew of flavors and you know just
[SPEAKER_03]: depends on what the day is what kind of
mood I'm in is what flavor I grab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you do have everything in that bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah no I make sure that I have choices I
like choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta I gotta take a guess here do you
have also do-si-do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some SFV and I have some Chem 4
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh how do you feel about Chem 4?
[SPEAKER_02]: We were getting around to the Chem Dog
topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Chem's nice all the Chem Dog lines
are really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a Chem 91 that is the other Chem
91 I don't know if you know that story or
[SPEAKER_03]: not but there's another Chem 91 that goes
around Swerve worked with it we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it for the past 10 11 years maybe
more you know that's a weird one every
[SPEAKER_03]: time we try to do any work with it there's
there hasn't been much that is came out
[SPEAKER_03]: that I was happy with but we did we hit it
with the male Dr. Who and I actually found
[SPEAKER_03]: several that I liked so there's potential
there but there's still a lot more testing
[SPEAKER_03]: to go on with that one but yeah no the
Chem lines are fantastic they're very
[SPEAKER_03]: potent they don't always cross very well
though I don't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I can I can attest to how they're
potent and I think that part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: potency comes from the fact that they are
kind of like a bit of a winning lottery
[SPEAKER_02]: ticket and it's kind of like the cookies
you know like not everything's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: come out exactly as good as the parent
because it is the anomaly in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said which of all the Chem
cuts is your favorite?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the 91 yeah I like the real 91 and
the other 91 so I like both the 91s quite
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit they have more of the fully flavor
for me or the the Chem-y funk right the
[SPEAKER_03]: four is great for production because it
gets nice and big but I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: as flavor is the flavor isn't as strong
it's a little mute on it but if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for weight that's where you want
to go if you were growing through your
[SPEAKER_03]: head and for a stronger flavor the 91s
where it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're the first person ever to
have not mentioned the Chem-D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you know Chem-D yeah it's good but I
wouldn't I would I think that the 91 is
[SPEAKER_03]: the best out of the bunch Chem's sister is
super hard to find and try to get to smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: any of so I haven't smoked any of that but
you know I've smoked Chem-D, Chem-4 and
[SPEAKER_03]: the 91 and out of them I like the 91 the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah well I mean depending on which Chem-D
you smoke you might have smoked the
[SPEAKER_02]: sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true that's very very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's interesting you say that
because I think at the end of the day 91
[SPEAKER_02]: rules for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty so with that being said final
question on the Chem-Dogs no one really
[SPEAKER_02]: knows what do you think the genetics
behind it we hear a lot of speculation of
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights and Hash Plan just things
of that general nature what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I definitely could see it being an
Afghani of some sort just because of
[SPEAKER_03]: structure and growth it's hard to say you
know speculation is a killer you know you
[SPEAKER_03]: can speculate on a lot of things and most
of the time neither one's right so you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I don't know it's hard to say what
the if they can figure out the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: genealogy thing maybe we'll know someday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay so on the topic of cannabis that
you like what are you more of an indica or
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa guy overall?
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting the reason why I asked that
was kind of like a bit of a setup to this
[SPEAKER_02]: question is because when I was looking at
a lot of your offerings I think more of
[SPEAKER_02]: them leaned towards the sativa side of
things were you aware of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes I am very aware of that but a lot of
people like those fast sativas you know
[SPEAKER_03]: they like just because we breathe them
doesn't mean that I smoke them you know
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously I've tested them and you know
once again it comes back to where I said
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't really necessarily matter what
I like what matters is what everybody else
[SPEAKER_03]: likes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know obviously I got to like it in
the beginning to create it but if I create
[SPEAKER_03]: it and put it out and nobody likes it then
obviously it's just something that I like
[SPEAKER_03]: if I create it and put it out and
everybody's like wow that's fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome then I know that hey okay we might
have something here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you expand your your tester group
a little bit larger and a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: larger you know back in the old days the
way we did it was we filled a jar filled
[SPEAKER_03]: jars multiple jars and the first jar empty
that was the winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's a good way of sorting the the
cream from the milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said do you ever get
people asking you to put out more indica
[SPEAKER_02]: dome crosses and if you were to do so what
would be some of the parents you would
[SPEAKER_02]: look to use straight away?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you know we're already working we're
already doing a mad scientist back cross
[SPEAKER_03]: we just did the mad scientist back cross
just around the first set of those those
[SPEAKER_03]: are really nice short squatty plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we're more into we work in our
lives more than you know stepping out of
[SPEAKER_03]: what we did a lot of the moms that we use
in our crosses were stuff the crosses that
[SPEAKER_03]: we made.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point in time we're still
working with our lives to get them to
[SPEAKER_03]: where we want them and then maybe looking
for a few others to play with and tinker
[SPEAKER_03]: with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But gotta be pretty special for us to want
to work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay and so overall do you like kind
of creating 50 50s or do you like more
[SPEAKER_02]: doing them leaning one side to all the
other?
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 50s are ideal you know because so
sative is you get a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_03]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indicas will bring you in your your
stiffer stronger stems and tighter
[SPEAKER_03]: intranodals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you need to stretch them out so
you hit them with a heavy in a sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you need to make them stronger
and shorter so you hit them more with an
[SPEAKER_03]: indica male.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more the diversity that I like to
look at is which direction are we trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to take the mom in are we trying to
stretch it make it more bigger buds or are
[SPEAKER_03]: we trying to make it shorter or maybe a
little bit faster?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah kind of goes from there and that's
why we're trying to we've got we've got
[SPEAKER_03]: several males that we've spent the last
few years picking out we just haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten around to working with them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are some of these strains that you
you know have got these males from and a
[SPEAKER_02]: question our guests absolutely love what
are some of the characteristics or traits
[SPEAKER_02]: you look for when selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_03]: Selecting a male definitely a uniformity
size of flower pod you know size of the
[SPEAKER_03]: the pollen the flower cluster at the end
of the cycle coloring potencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah just depends on if we're you know are
we looking for a male that's going to even
[SPEAKER_03]: out branches make so make more so for you
know multi head type crop are we looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for something that's going to be more just
two or three kind of top you know two to
[SPEAKER_03]: four tops or whatever it's going to go
more straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just depends on what we're really looking
for is where we're wanting to go is what
[SPEAKER_03]: we look for in the mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right at the moment we just we've had a
like I said it took us three years to find
[SPEAKER_03]: our doctor who male and we actually
founded it a friends in a friend's garden
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't even a seed that we popped.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took us four years before we found a
quantum male that we liked we're getting
[SPEAKER_03]: ready to start playing with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with him we're going to bring in a
different a few other OGs and hit him with
[SPEAKER_03]: just because the sweet Irish push lineage
there and just kind of see where that goes
[SPEAKER_03]: mainly with the quantum metal we're
wanting to more isolate into the THCV and
[SPEAKER_03]: the CVC and a few other of the you know
the finer cannabinoids that we're now
[SPEAKER_03]: discovering or figuring out what uses they
actually have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay and one of the things we've
heard of in recent episodes in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: like the cutting-edge things people do
with males is reversing males and being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to express the male as if it was a
female and you can't smoke it because you
[SPEAKER_02]: spray it with some pretty toxic chemicals
but you can certainly get a possible
[SPEAKER_02]: indication of the terpene profile and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something you've ever thought
about or even potentially engaged in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know about the practice personally I
wouldn't do it because of like you just
[SPEAKER_03]: said you have to spray with some pretty
harsh chemicals I don't like bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: those of anywhere around my garden
especially for something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A male will produce its own smell at the
end of its flower cycle and throughout its
[SPEAKER_03]: flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people you know it's a cool thing
to look at and it looks cool in a picture
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that but you can't smoke it so you
know and it's not fully expressed so I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know I haven't done it due to the
fact as I said I don't like the chemicals
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have to use to do it and I just
don't foresee with you know I think you
[SPEAKER_03]: see a lot of the same stuff if you just
let the mouth flower out to full cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay so I mean very much in that
topic how do you feel about resinous males
[SPEAKER_02]: do you feel like it's a positive indicator
for the males potentially to pass on good
[SPEAKER_02]: traits?
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again it's male dependent due to the
fact that some will and some won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything transfers one it's still a
50-50 mix right so just because it
[SPEAKER_03]: transfers with this female it may not
transfer with that other female.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once again it's going to be strain
dependent and male dependent upon you know
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not a resinous male is going to
make a non so resinous female more
[SPEAKER_03]: resinous you got a 50-50 chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay so how do you feel about the
idea of breeding with hermaphrodite prone
[SPEAKER_02]: females is it kind of like a challenge
you're willing to take up or do you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like you may be setting yourself up for
more trouble down the line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's something that's already prone
for hermaphrodite yes absolutely it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing is passing along that
genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you have steady females and you
lightly them you stress them in a way to
[SPEAKER_03]: where they produce flowers I feel that's a
little bit different because they're tried
[SPEAKER_03]: and true females that you've ran flower
that didn't herm or didn't produce any
[SPEAKER_03]: bananas or anything to that effect until
they were stressed to a point where they
[SPEAKER_03]: thought they were going to die and wanted
to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about feminized seeds in
general?
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends on how you go about
doing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing it with the chemical spray
on females that don't show any
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphidation signs beforehand absolutely
that's the proper way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a plant that's hermaphrodite
and it seeds out your room yeah you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it's interesting because some of the
earliest breeding programs I heard about
[SPEAKER_02]: were apparently more a result of the later
of what you said than the earlier ones
[SPEAKER_02]: like I believe I heard from a credible
source that some of the original OG Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: Femseed releases from Oregon Kid were were
like not an intentionally feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: project but more of like a potential
hermaphrodism type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I can totally see that you know it
happens a lot you know I mean anytime you
[SPEAKER_03]: find a backseat there was hermaphrodite
somewhere right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you think about it on that logic
the chem line we were just talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: those were all backseat they were all from
hermaphrodite crisis process perilla glue
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphrodite cross cookies hermaphrodite
cross you know a lot of the great strains
[SPEAKER_03]: that are out there the popular strains
that are out there were hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it a good thing or is it a bad
thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well from what I see it could be either
or.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how would you feel about the argument
which some people put forward and which
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll admit I'm starting to buy into myself
that arguably the most memorable and
[SPEAKER_02]: influential strains of all cannabis
history were bag seed hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I would you know that were marked
they're all good strains absolutely I
[SPEAKER_03]: would have to agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were accidental crosses that nobody
intended to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it certainly says something for our
legacy as breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the topic of being a breeder this is
one I definitely wanted to run by you and
[SPEAKER_02]: people are probably scratching their heads
why I haven't done it so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone in your camp clearly has to be a
Doctor Who fan given all the strain names
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is who is the who's the
big Doctor Who fan who initiated the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: more importantly do you think that there
was kind of this advantageous marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: side of things given that there was this
kind of household recognizable name
[SPEAKER_02]: involved?
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally it absolutely was.
[SPEAKER_03]: My father I grew up watching Doctor Who
with my father.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sons grew up watching Doctor Who with
their grandfather my father and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: just all it was it was a very memorable
point in time we all would get together on
[SPEAKER_03]: a Sunday and watch Doctor Who on PBS and
it was just something that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: really into it was originally the kids
came up pretty much with the idea and we
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of just ran with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now though that we found a Doctor Who male
now we're it's who's value or value who or
[SPEAKER_03]: who's cookies or you know we're calling
everything who's this or who's that kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of thing who's boss or frostboss cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah we have a whole bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how much effort do you put into the
consideration of marketing when naming a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain do you just think no I'm naming a
strain what I want to name it or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes think to yourself oh but I also
need to ensure that it does have some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of commercial flyability sorry viability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right you know it helps to have a catchy
name for sure there's some names out there
[SPEAKER_03]: that are really long that just don't roll
off the tongue so well but you know
[SPEAKER_03]: normally when we do a name we try to
include both parents but a lot of them we
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's obviously someone we haven't
but there is somewhat of a reference you
[SPEAKER_03]: know cuz I mean so Doctor Who is a cross
of a mad scientist to a time wreck kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: self-explanatory when you look at it from
that point of view right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The TARDIS is a time wreck it's an Oregon
diesel by a time wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that we kind of thought that was
you know pretty viable as well there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with the who's this and who's that
the kids don't necessarily like it I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's funny as can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it marketable?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see I don't know we haven't released
any of it we haven't taken any flowers to
[SPEAKER_03]: market yet or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just what I'm calling them right
now so we can kind of keep track of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah marketability and a strain name
is great seeing as how we're in our own
[SPEAKER_03]: industry trademark infringement you know
stuff like that kind of goes away a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have all of our strain names
and our names come names a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: trademarked for use in the cannabis
industry have had for a few years at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point you know and actually the funny
story was we got two days we got it we
[SPEAKER_03]: received our okay for trademark within the
cannabis industry for Doctor Who.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two days later the OLCC which is the who
runs the cannabis in Oregon came out with
[SPEAKER_03]: a list of the hundred strains that you
couldn't use the name of and of course
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctor Who is one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have trademarks within state given
us to by the state but then again we have
[SPEAKER_03]: this independent group telling us we can't
use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know I kind of found that to be
weird but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you ultimately call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek Farms calls theirs the Doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dog House grows our Grape Haichu Cut and
they call that Grape Who.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay yeah so they do skirt around it a
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't have it on the label at the
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah you know I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next thing I wanted to kind of ask you
what do you feel generally speaking
[SPEAKER_02]: because I mean I think a big component of
what you've been saying today is that
[SPEAKER_02]: individualization is a huge part of stuff
but just generally speaking what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think is the best type of weed for anxiety
and what do you think is the best type of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed for depression in terms of the
characteristics you might be looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: either to embody?
[SPEAKER_03]: So for I prefer high nursing for anxieties
I suffer from anxieties quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find Indica's are a lot better for that
and for anxieties and relaxation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're depressed though the good sativa
you know to get you uplifted and feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: good and sativas make you feel really
creative and wanting to go to do stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: I would explain to people it's not
necessarily that you wanted to go do stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: you just feel good you know it's you don't
feel your pains you're not you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: better outlook on because you're not in
pain you're not in in distress you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: you know depressed you want you actually
are looking at life a lot differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay so if someone was looking to
take up growing to kind of help with an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue like what we just mentioned or
something kind of similar do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: they should consider CBD as like one of
the first things they should grow or do
[SPEAKER_02]: you think that just regular strains is
probably a better first port of call?
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again it really depended upon what
the issue was that they were trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: address.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would tell somebody with PTSD would
be mercy with pains with same thing or
[SPEAKER_03]: CBDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody that has cancer or has arthritis
or fibromyalgia or you know body aches,
[SPEAKER_03]: pains, joints so on and stuff like that
CBD is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously it's fantastic for seizures,
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finding great works in it and also
in autism.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know so you really have to curtail
around each individual patient at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah well I mean it brings us to kind of
the master question of it all in that to
[SPEAKER_02]: what degree do you think that cannabinoid
therapy as a general term needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: individualized and I guess maybe a
specific way of phrasing that is you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like people will hear that a certain
strain is good for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe let's just say depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that someone with depression
should should look and try to get those
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that are well known or at the end of
the day you're still gonna have to do some
[SPEAKER_02]: individual searching for what just kind of
clicks with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I know I would definitely start with
popular strains that are known for and see
[SPEAKER_03]: if those work for you and then if those
don't work for you or parts of it works
[SPEAKER_03]: and parts of it doesn't you know like the
onset is great but then towards the end
[SPEAKER_03]: you're too couch-locked or whatever you
know maybe you need to move more towards
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of a 70-30 indica sativa maybe you
need to go to a 60-40 or something to that
[SPEAKER_03]: effect get a little more sativa in there
so you're not the lag down is so bad but
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah I would definitely start out with
with a known strains genetics that help
[SPEAKER_03]: the symptoms that you're suffering from
and kind of go from there once again it's
[SPEAKER_03]: so personalized and individualized that
you know at least on the medical side I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that it's it's almost overwhelming I
would believe for the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do you think are some
medicinal strains that commonly get
[SPEAKER_02]: overlooked from your offerings?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well we just did some CBD crosses we
acquired a a male Harley suit from Levi
[SPEAKER_03]: which was OG Ringo's son who was his own
OG Ringo's son and we did a bunch we did a
[SPEAKER_03]: few crosses to our normal setup of moms
and they all turned out pretty much two to
[SPEAKER_03]: ones which is fantastic they're definitely
I'm definitely getting rave reviews from
[SPEAKER_03]: them from a lot of our patients that
that's the ratio that they're looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: we're getting upwards of 14 to 18% CBD
with half that in THC just depends on what
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors you're looking for what terpene
profiles you're looking for you know those
[SPEAKER_03]: are really good
[SPEAKER_03]: most of them you know so our Sonic
screwdriver is really good we get a we
[SPEAKER_03]: find we get a lot of people that it helps
with opiates quite a bit there's a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids in there it's CB 10 CB 9 that
are like a opiate molecule but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: laid back over upon themselves so we're
wondering if maybe it's working as an
[SPEAKER_03]: opiate blocker or similar enough to where
it allows you the person to get off
[SPEAKER_03]: opiates to where it stimulates the same
receptors there as but obviously a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: healthier for you yeah okay so one of the
last questions I wanted to quickly ask you
[SPEAKER_02]: about a random strain orange cream soda
it's another parent haven't come across
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not in many other crosses what's the
backstory on that one orange cream soda so
[SPEAKER_03]: we had gotten a clone from a gentleman you
know some seeds from gentlemen he created
[SPEAKER_03]: called daddy's girl it was sour diesel by
MK ultra and it was a fantastic strain and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we crossed it with a New York diesel
and the progeny from that it was the only
[SPEAKER_03]: orange flavored one out of them they all
kind of have like this soda creamy flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: to them but that one just was nice and
orangey so yeah it's it's it's not one
[SPEAKER_03]: that's very potent it's definitely a
daytime smoker for a light smoker it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't get you too hyper it doesn't get
you too low but it's nice and mellow and
[SPEAKER_03]: keeps you pretty pain-free and works works
quite well and has just this fantastic
[SPEAKER_03]: orange cream soda smell and flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic so can we expect to see it pop
up again in the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah yeah yeah we just crossed her to
the Dr. Who and we're gonna probably we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: wind up being doing we're crossing her to
our quantum kushmel as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah nice nice and when can we expect to be
able to maybe get that is there still some
[SPEAKER_02]: testing to come?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah oh yeah we're slow when it comes to
that you know we release maybe one or two
[SPEAKER_03]: strains a year I like to grow that strain
multiple times and the reason being is
[SPEAKER_03]: normally I just pop a five pack at a time
the reason being is because that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: most people buy so I want to see what
somebody's getting in a five pack so I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: pop I don't know eight nine ten five packs
and see what I see you know so
[SPEAKER_03]: realistically 40 to 50 seeds at a time
pretty much just to see what I see and
[SPEAKER_03]: that takes a while and we send them out
all over the country for testing as well
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we send them off to our larger
operations where they can run a hundred to
[SPEAKER_03]: five hundred at a time kind of thing just
to see how they do all across.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our testing is pretty tight and we got
to see something we really like kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah of course so brings up an interesting
point in my mind of pricing seeds give and
[SPEAKER_02]: you only do you know one or two projects a
year it must make pricing hard for you
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know there's a lot of work
going into it but I noticed you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys are certainly no aficionado seeds in
regards to your pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about the whole topic and
do you struggle sometimes to kind of you
[SPEAKER_02]: know feel a price reach a price that maybe
you feel comfortable with in all regards?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know so I remember when I had to buy
seeds and how much they were and how hard
[SPEAKER_03]: it was for me to come up the money to buy
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we decided to come do the seed
company thing I was like you know we need
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep it low to where anybody can buy
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing this for the patients we
really got into it for helping in
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients can't afford five hundred dollar
10 packs they're doing good to afford a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred dollar 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really see that and I don't want
people to be denied good medicine because
[SPEAKER_03]: they can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see that in real life bad enough as it
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again if you can get somebody to pay
a thousand dollars for a 10 pack eight
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred dollars for 10 pack why wouldn't
you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I've never attempted it I don't
know that I would but then again you know
[SPEAKER_03]: if somebody will pay it why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: If the market allow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what type of new or just special
offerings do you have coming up and do you
[SPEAKER_02]: have anything you know I guess special in
regards to say going to be released at
[SPEAKER_02]: events but maybe not online or anything
like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah actually probably our next one is
going to be our mad scientist back across
[SPEAKER_03]: will be our next release.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really liking how it's turning out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely showing what we want to
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cut genotypes down to two got short
and you got tall so a couple more back
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses and we'll have the mad scientist
where we want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know it definitely has some very
beautiful things going on so I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: we may release that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may have a few special things with this
down in Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said before that's the only cup we're
doing this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah you know there's definitely stuff
that we do small batches of that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe I'll bring some with me just to see
if anybody wants any.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the next big release will most likely
be our mad scientist back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay and you got any idea on an ETA of
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we might do a small release at
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see we're still we're waiting on
some COAs right at the moment but
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else in grow rooms and grows
here and grows there has come back very
[SPEAKER_03]: positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also we did a medicine time which is
medicine woman by time wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that we're liking a lot of people are
liking it as well so that might come out
[SPEAKER_03]: as well at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to do two at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly Emerald Cup as far as like one
seats here now or something like that will
[SPEAKER_03]: get it maybe in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay so on to our last one or two
questions before we've got our few little
[SPEAKER_02]: quickfire ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a bit of a large question so
you know feel free to think about it for a
[SPEAKER_02]: minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what type of a legacy do you kind of
want to leave on the industry or
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically that like you know homegrown
natural wonders would leave?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really thought about a legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not quite done yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I think a legacy is not really
decided until you're done doing your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the group that I've joined up
with now the Dutch consulting company
[SPEAKER_03]: we're pretty far from being done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the obvious thing to state is that
it's not exclusively Dutch.
[SPEAKER_03]: No it's not exclusively Dutch but there
are a couple of Dutch members.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah you know we're a consulting
company and working with George is just
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's definitely on another level when it
comes to growers for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The scale that he's done for a long time
is just amazing and the way that he breaks
[SPEAKER_03]: everything down and makes it's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really happy working with this company
and yeah we're just getting started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think our legacy will be for a
little bit but you know we are part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: pioneers in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that'll be the legacy that we
helped make sure that everybody got a fair
[SPEAKER_03]: you know safe access to medicine and or
just recreational marijuana whatever you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to look at it as.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll move on to our last little quick
fire questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the best cannabis you've ever
smoked in your life?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh good golly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really tough question because you
know you can have the most flavorful that
[SPEAKER_03]: you've smoked and you know the different
specific high that you've had.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I was to kind of look at an all
around combined I'd have to go back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: mid 80s and back to the old school
roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you know granted it could have been
my point of references from back then but
[SPEAKER_03]: my father was a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was growing a bunch of different pot
and when that came to town it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't growing anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of wish we would have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah I'd have to say the 80s
roadkills.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 80s skunk or Afghanis or whatever they
were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of a flip side question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is in your opinion the worst strain
to have gained a heap of momentum?
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel like there's not enough punch?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's purple but there ain't no punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess maybe it's good marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Symbiotic is really good about marketing
and hiking up strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you actually do a lab test on it or
whatever you come to find out that oh
[SPEAKER_03]: that's all lipids.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's shiny there in the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not chamomile or anything to that
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right it's all lipids and waxes and
that's the problem with a lot of those
[SPEAKER_03]: strains like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look great in a picture and they can
get hyped up all you want but when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes right down to smoking them and doing
COAs and doing extractions well if you do
[SPEAKER_03]: you wax your extractions yeah your returns
on those strains are super low because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all waxes and all fatties and lipids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right onward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So desert island top three you're going to
take with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds or flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good question right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got an infinite supply of flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: No explanation how but it just it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to figure out the run out point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So wow that's a rough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I probably sound it probably you
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow only three huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the only give people two.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I probably have to throw some Dr.
Who in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kin.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hard for the last one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I can see why it was only two.
[SPEAKER_03]: The third one is kind of rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably want something a little bit
more more uplifting so I probably go with
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know maybe like it maybe an old
silver super silver haze or something to
[SPEAKER_03]: that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's a solid pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solid pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right so what is a cut that you used
to have but you've lost and you wish you
[SPEAKER_02]: had it back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that daddy girl was pretty nice and
that was that sour diesel by MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of wish I had that one still.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too many.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that's why you just cruise
through them hoping that you'll find one
[SPEAKER_03]: that will replace that in some kind of a
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah we've always been fairly fortunate
about keeping backups and you know giving
[SPEAKER_03]: to tight circles so we haven't really lost
a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That hash plant back in the 90s that would
have been fantastic nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah those would probably be my main
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lucky last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could go back in time anywhere any
place presumably to collect some landrace
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds where and when and what variety?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably yeah the Afghani, the Afghani
mountains, the Hindu Kush mountains,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Silk Trail I guess is what they call
it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's where a lot of the
really good stuff comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again you got the chocolate ties,
you've got you know the whole continent
[SPEAKER_03]: over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we count that as this one place?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just broader Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a broad broad broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you know it's that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never really thought about that one
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could go back in a time where would I
go and what seeds would I want?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah Afghanistan and the Hindu
mountains pretty pretty much I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two very good and popular answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bringing us to the end of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any shout outs or comments
you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously a shout out to Dutch consulting
company for providing me with part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: happiest I've been working in a long long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously shout out to my sons because
without them we wouldn't be doing what we
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course their mom my wife who has
put up with a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that shout out to all my
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all know who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for all the support for over the
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for coming on the
show Odie and setting some things straight
[SPEAKER_02]: and dropping some awesome history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've been working on this for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you said we spoke last year at the
Emerald Cup and discussed it then and here
[SPEAKER_03]: we are almost a year later and finally
talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been great being on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for asking us to be on and allowing
us to maybe hopefully clear up some
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to smoke some Doctor Who with
you again soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming you will be at the Emerald
Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come swimming by for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it folks.
