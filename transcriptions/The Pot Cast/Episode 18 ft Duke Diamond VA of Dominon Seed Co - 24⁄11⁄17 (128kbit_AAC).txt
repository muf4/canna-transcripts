[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and what we can expect from him
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome
to our second part tour, Duke Diamond VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first question this time, what are you
currently smoking on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a Genius skunk, you know,
popped out and it was like Captain Crunch,
[SPEAKER_06]: Crunch Berries, and it's real good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of surprised me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a cross we can maybe expect?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to show it to Mr. Soul there,
see if he likes it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think he would.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I kind of discounted it because like
I kind of made it already knowing like,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, it's going to just turn out like
Genius because like everything kind of,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, leans that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, you know, see what happens
and the whole time it was growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, it looks like Genius and
kind of smells like it and same,
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a little more resin, a little more
structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of discounted it until I was
like popping the jars and Crunch Berry
[SPEAKER_06]: smell came out and I was like,
whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I tried some and then kind of hooked on
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it might be something I have to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's interesting because I
remember, I think I mentioned before that
[SPEAKER_01]: I had found a really Genius dominant,
Genius Hayes, which is perfect because
[SPEAKER_01]: that was exactly what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings to mind the question for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the ideal partner for Genius?
[SPEAKER_01]: If she is so dominant, would you need to
match that with something equally dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the ideal partner like something kind
of more quote submissive and just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing her to shine?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your theories on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it'd be like whatever your end
goal would be if you're trying to make
[SPEAKER_06]: like more like a replica of the mom or if
you're trying to make something totally
[SPEAKER_06]: different, maybe like leaving certain
attributes and changing others.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it kind of depends what your end
goal would be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I was going to back cross it and
try to get that phenotype kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: isolated, I'd probably...
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when we did the Green Avenger,
I would probably like use like a male from
[SPEAKER_06]: that or something and back cross it at
least probably two, maybe three times till
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt like it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would like probably filial
breed it F3, F4 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like you would get a pretty
good representation of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: that one phenome and try to improve it
along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: As well, because like any time I've ever
tried to like really inbreed something,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to, you know, fix certain
things, you know, while maintaining the
[SPEAKER_06]: good attributes too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of tricky sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that kind of makes sense to me
in a way because the Green Avenger,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you even mentioned this,
it's probably the most replica of genius
[SPEAKER_01]: in seed form of all the Brothers Grimm
offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, at least from what I
could see, seems to have that really...
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say a lot more,
but a little bit more aesthetic bud look
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of the space queen and the,
you know, the derivatives of that had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you try to retain that per se or do
you think that the genius has good
[SPEAKER_01]: aesthetics as it is?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looks good as is, but,
you know, it's kind of a weird,
[SPEAKER_06]: weird point too, because like it does like
the biomania thing so like later,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like mid 40s and then it starts
getting interested in like resin
[SPEAKER_06]: production and like on a good run with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looks pretty pretty darn good,
but the branches on it are kind of floppy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not like the most,
you know, structurally strong plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially for something that grows such
big bugs on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the yield on it's like really
nice, but you got to keep up with all the
[SPEAKER_06]: branches.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Green Avenger really, you know,
strengthened everything up and it also
[SPEAKER_06]: reinforced a lot of the desirable traits
that like ran through the Apollo lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, like, you know, going back with it,
it's not like a back cross per se,
[SPEAKER_06]: but like a generational back cross of
taking those desirable Apollo genes and
[SPEAKER_06]: then going back, you know, to the,
you know, to the grandma.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seemed like, you know, it fixed all
the weak branching and giving it that
[SPEAKER_06]: extra layer of resin was really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only thing that I would say like,
that I would like to see like stronger in
[SPEAKER_06]: it or not really stronger, but I guess
more consistent in the progeny would be
[SPEAKER_06]: the effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause Genius has a really, really,
really nice speedy effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like some of those Green Avengers
would just put you, put you like
[SPEAKER_06]: ridiculously stone, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite one was like real speedy for
about like 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you would just crash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, crash hard, which,
you know, like the Genius wouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I think like you can get a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like, if you wanted to like
replicate that chemo type, you'd really
[SPEAKER_06]: have to, you know, conquer down on that,
you know, to get it, get it just so.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think like a couple of back crosses
from say like a Green Avenger back to that
[SPEAKER_06]: would, would, you know, isolate that a
little bit better, but it's just,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, each step you'd have to make
sure to not, not let any of the weak
[SPEAKER_06]: branching back into it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, would you consider in, with all that
being said, would you consider just say
[SPEAKER_01]: doing S1s of it to be a bit of a waste of
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: In regards to trying to put it in seed
reform, because like maybe you could put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in seed form in the most basic of
senses, but you would still have all the
[SPEAKER_01]: issues which you just, you know,
listed, you would try to improve on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you still consider doing just a
straight S1?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like if you did like a S1 and then,
you know, found that particular female
[SPEAKER_06]: that matched up to it very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it could also go through like
stress testing and everything and not like
[SPEAKER_06]: freak out, maybe reversing that one back
to the mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you, you, you might be able to
find something in the progeny that would
[SPEAKER_06]: have like a stronger structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's on that X chromosome going
back, like that should, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: should improve it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you never really know till you,
till you do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he might actually, he might be working
on doing that here in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like the other, I guess like the
op, not the opposite way of thinking
[SPEAKER_06]: about, another way of thinking of it is
like, you might have a certain female that
[SPEAKER_06]: you can get just about everything out of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, smell, taste, structure,
flowering time, calyx ratio, colors,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like it never, never has that,
that good potency that the, that the
[SPEAKER_06]: original mom had.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've noticed that like certain ones,
like you can only get it to pass,
[SPEAKER_06]: like I think by reversing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Out to something else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, trying to recover it,
recover it from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems like certain things that
won't breed out, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might actually have to like do the
bat cross and the filial route on one end.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also like self it, you know,
or not self it, but out, reverse it and
[SPEAKER_06]: out cross it to maybe something else
closely related in the line to like go
[SPEAKER_06]: back to it, you know, to really,
you know, get everything out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every single point made, you know,
from your structure vigors and read zone
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff and resistances and yada,
yada, yada, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it might take like using kind of like
three different tools to get to your end
[SPEAKER_06]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some meaningful breeding in
those ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess if we're going to drag things
back to one of the main projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's interested from you,
the skunk project, how's it all going?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you want to give us a bit
of an update on it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's going real good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, like we can hit,
we can hit a lot of those phenos,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's not like every single one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like some of them tend to be a little
more fuely and you get the burnt rubber
[SPEAKER_06]: smell and then like, you know,
you can lean to a more just kind of a
[SPEAKER_06]: burnt rubber rotten meat.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then sometimes you get, you know,
like a good blend of everything where it's
[SPEAKER_06]: coming out pretty, pretty damn skunky.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's more or less like getting it to
the point to where, you know, I could say,
[SPEAKER_06]: all right, guys, here's, you know,
a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you pop them all, it's just,
it's all skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's just, you got to,
you know, pick which one you like the
[SPEAKER_06]: best, I guess, you know, for like maybe
flower time or, you know, normal,
[SPEAKER_06]: normal phenome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds almost similar to like it,
just a Cindy 99 phenohunt, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just pick the one you like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty much, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to refine it like a little bit,
a little bit further than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't, I couldn't have it out there
if like everything isn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: firing on all cylinders and, you know,
real good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I figure anything that takes that much
time, you know, might as well make it
[SPEAKER_06]: super, super, rad and put the extra time
into it and, you know, make sure that
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody would be happy with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause if I got to put my name on it,
I don't want any bunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: going out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I guess just to clarify for
the Die Hard fans, are we talking about a
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk project here or a roadkill skunk
project?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, cause if, you know, like to me
personally, like I feel like if that's the
[SPEAKER_06]: same thing, you know, like, there really
shouldn't be any different ration,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like if you got a skunk,
it should smell like a skunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause, you know, the things that are dead
on the road, they got ran over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're smelling their,
their gland, you know, that, that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that gland burst and that, that skunk
sprays out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I always kind of felt,
you know, that that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was kind of messed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody, you know, had that, the real
sweet skunk, you know, and started calling
[SPEAKER_06]: it that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so like, yeah, when I'm working on,
like if you, if you did have a
[SPEAKER_06]: differentiation of the two, I guess
roadkill skunk, whatever the one people
[SPEAKER_06]: would consider stinkier, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what the people are after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so kind of with that being said,
I have seen a few photos going around of a
[SPEAKER_01]: few of our friends with a playing chord
roadkill skunk number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this just maybe a particular pheno
that's, you know, hitting all the right
[SPEAKER_01]: spots for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it's, um, so when I, when I really
got to cranking down on everything,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, I had like a bunch of
older stock that I had to get pollinated
[SPEAKER_06]: and every, or pollinated, germinated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, there were a few things that,
you know, you used to give us that funk
[SPEAKER_06]: back in the day, you know, growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, you know, I figured like I'd pop
them and check them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I kind of just, you know,
was doing a pollination, had a client and
[SPEAKER_06]: one of them in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like more of the sativa route
and, um, toss those in there, get them
[SPEAKER_06]: made, um, grew them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, you know, you got, you got some,
some little skunky notes to it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you get like the cheesy, cheesy,
skunky, citrusy diesel a little bit with
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, then some of them would be more like,
I don't know how to explain it other than
[SPEAKER_06]: the sour apple green tea or something,
you know, but nonetheless, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it was kind of just like for
shits and grins.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I did, um, there were like 12
things that got hit, um, early on to kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of get the project rolling.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, wasn't going to go that
route, but just kind of did it just cause,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and, um, hooked up with a few
friends with it and they grew them out
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, everybody liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, yeah, it's funky as hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was like, I know that like,
I mean, yeah, it's skunky, but like,
[SPEAKER_06]: it gets a lot better than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was just kind of like some
shits and giggles stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we just quickly, jump back to you
mentioned earlier, as well as I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: photos of this one as well, the,
uh, the skelly cross to the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you also said there's the chem
dog in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's, what can we expect from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that be like an individual release,
the chem, sis, skunk, skelly, or just more
[SPEAKER_01]: of an R and D thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of, kind of more of an R and D
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, you know, I don't,
I don't always hook up, hook up friends
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, cool people just to,
just to be cool like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, um, like, uh, what's more to be
seen out of that is more like an isolation
[SPEAKER_06]: of the, of the mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, not much is really going to change off
of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, hmm, put it, um, you kind of,
you kind of bring in a lot of family genes
[SPEAKER_06]: together, if you will.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, like the recombination of that
stuff, it worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, you know, it was like
spitting out replicas of the mother
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, you know, they were like a little
bit of, it's a little bit of variance,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, which, you know, I expect,
you know, to see like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: what, what, what are the weirdo is going
to come out like, and, um, like one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: ones with the sister, it smells like,
uh, like yellow starburst candy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, like if you could have that smell with
like an, a patchouli type incense,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I don't know, it's like real off
the wall, but like all the rest of them,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, kind of, you know, like garlicky
and skunky and funky like that sister was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the one thing I noticed like when
doing the light leak stress testing,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, they resisted all that, you know,
very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one that kind of, you know,
tapped out a little bit toward the end,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it wasn't the last, you know,
that last week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, I mean, it was pretty,
pretty decent light leak I was giving them
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they did a lot, a lot better than what
I'd even thought they would do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did notice like, just like the mom,
um, when they were at that, that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that prime time harvest window that they
were going to try to poke at least one or
[SPEAKER_06]: two banners out, you know, somewhere in
the top of the canopy and, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: they resisted the light leak.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might could say that maybe that
was like their point of tapping out,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the mom kind of does that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it wants to push that little one
out, like at that, that peak, peak harvest
[SPEAKER_06]: time it seems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of didn't pay that as much mind,
you know, I was just kind of looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: more of what was, what was retained.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was nice to see that, you know,
you know, they didn't, they didn't really,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, freak out, but, um, out of the
test group, um, there were a few of them
[SPEAKER_06]: that had, didn't even have the late
Nanner, you know, there was 100%
[SPEAKER_06]: hermaphrodite free, which, you know,
really surprised me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then out of those, uh, one of them
actually also happened to be the best one,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that told me, Hey, you know,
you're on the right track.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to sacrifice him any of the
other stuff, you know, like, like that
[SPEAKER_06]: late Nanner trait, you know, that's
wanting to push out during the peak time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Hey, the, the best pheno didn't do
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also resisted, you know, a lot of the
stress too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turned out to be the most potent
and the most, uh, representative of the
[SPEAKER_06]: mom as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, huh, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, you know, in a couple of
generations, we can fix that and kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: have more of like a pure, pure chem seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the goal of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many generations do you think it
would take to get such a thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Only one way to find out, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I mean, just, just based off of
what I saw on the F1, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: if I want, if I wanted to be like a real
shortcut asshole, I'd just be exit one
[SPEAKER_06]: time and I bet you I'd be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if, if we're going to have it more
like a seed form of the, of the mother,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, I'd think at least, you know,
three or four back crosses and maybe a
[SPEAKER_06]: filial breeding after that, maybe,
or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's really hard to tell until you
really get into it and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: start working them and growing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you kind of, kind of see what
direction you're going to have to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, shit, there's still the F1.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, I was real happy with it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, to draw you back to a point
you made before, you said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all kind of drawing on a lot of
similar genetics in this cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to remind everyone, we're talking
about skelly, original skunk, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem sis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I noticed is people frequently
reference skelly as like a skunky strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always inquire about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's almost like this pause for a
moment and they're like, oh no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just meant it tasted skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like, I don't know,
you know, not to sound weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like, you know, like some people
out there maybe think there's skunk in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's like kind of the impression I
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think anything about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's really stinky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I wouldn't call it skunky,
but it's nasty, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and the, the, the main components of
it, um, being as what it is, it's like old
[SPEAKER_06]: seed bank um, hash plant, you know,
like a Neville made hash plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to say it was like,
you know, one cross to like a male of an L
[SPEAKER_06]: five and then L two or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I know that it's like,
it's primarily, it's like a Northern
[SPEAKER_06]: lights combination focusing more on the
shorter phenose, the more endocondominant
[SPEAKER_06]: phenose.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, it, it, it definitely is
stinky as a motherfucker, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: to me it was like more, more feely spicy,
hashy, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, like, I mean, if you had like a
bud in your pocket and that, here's the
[SPEAKER_06]: other thing too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, to me, a lot of weed can
smell skunky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but like something I've noticed is
like a, you know, weed in a jar is you're
[SPEAKER_06]: smelling it like all concentrated like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you, when you take like a bud out and
you let it breathe, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: able to permeate and especially like if it
gets hot, you know, if you're just walking
[SPEAKER_06]: around with a bud in your pocket,
like in a bag, you know, a lot of weed can
[SPEAKER_06]: smell really skunky, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot what I was going with that,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, ultimately, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe one of the other
implications we get is something a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: guests have referenced in that the
roadkill skunk itself, or even more so
[SPEAKER_01]: just those extremely acrid skunky smells
may actually be something which is more of
[SPEAKER_01]: like an Afghani artifact as opposed to
like a Sam the skunk man type thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, I'm, I'm always on that same
line of thought that a lot of the skunkier
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff from back in the day were like
Afghani hybrids and, um, like skunk Afghan
[SPEAKER_06]: hybrids as well as like, um, Northern
light skunk hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those tended to be, you know,
everything that range like from garlic to
[SPEAKER_06]: fecal, you know, and everything in between
coffee beans slash skunk, burnt rubber,
[SPEAKER_06]: that whole side of the spectrum,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another post I've seen, which I think
might be in relation to all of this is
[SPEAKER_01]: you've referenced in a few posts something
about the masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is the masterpiece?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's like all my little, all my little
projects I've been working on for so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're finally having them all done,
all completed and this be done like,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, and then I'll feel good about it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, cause like a lot of projects,
you know, there's a lot of years on some
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff too, and some stuff I don't really
get to talk about cause, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of want to keep it DL,
but, um, as it is be real nice to have it
[SPEAKER_06]: all done and, you know, people can enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the thing is like I made
everything kind of for me to my,
[SPEAKER_06]: my snobby, uh, lead standards.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of figure if I really like it,
you know, other people would probably like
[SPEAKER_06]: it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah, it'll just kind of be the
end of the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm making a few things that I was pretty
proud of and it'd be all, all finito.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so can people expect to be able to
maybe grab a few of these finito projects
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, some of them, like it's,
um, it's just some stuff that's,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, been like steps into making,
making those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, like I'll always have some,
some neat, you know, neat things with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were things that I made like
intermediary steps or things that I made
[SPEAKER_06]: just to like kind of study, like what a
male's doing across a broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after running them and growing them
and testing them, smoking them,
[SPEAKER_06]: stressing them and everything,
like they were really super awesome,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like, it was never intended to be
the project.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just more of a study of like how
the male's, you know, kind of going along
[SPEAKER_06]: with another female and, um, you know,
and stuff was really awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I'll have some of those things
and like, I'll hold onto them like a
[SPEAKER_06]: little while because, you know,
I'm still, you know, researching them and
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at them and, you know,
making sure that, you know, I know what I
[SPEAKER_06]: need to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I don't particularly want them to
say, oh, okay, here you go everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when it's like part of a program
that I'm working as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, a lot of it's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like so many steps have been made,
you know, I consider them what's left of
[SPEAKER_06]: the, what I made it to do all the testing
with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, I can let some of those out,
but they're real limited, limited
[SPEAKER_06]: quantities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's interesting that you're going
to do it that way because I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: almost one of the best ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause something I noticed was a while ago,
someone posted a photo of growing out
[SPEAKER_01]: Cindy 88 and it was like, everyone in the
comments was like, wow, you got to go out
[SPEAKER_01]: like one of the steps in like,
you know, the overall process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, obviously, you know,
there's a lot of kind of excitement as to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there'd be more variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be cool to see, you know,
all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in a way it's almost like the
most rarest of the limited edition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that had been what the super city
was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's really, it's really
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was really, really awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, like I said with that one,
I was just more or less like looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: what the mail does in a, in a related
cross, you know, like being able to see
[SPEAKER_06]: like Kim 91 with the same mail sister D
with the same mail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and things that were outside of that
family too, you know, like all types of
[SPEAKER_06]: things across the board and really figure
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what's happening, but like with
that one with headband, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: if there is like huge, big old fat colors
and real stinky lime candy Kush,
[SPEAKER_06]: like a little skunkiness to it as well,
you know, but, um, real killer,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know, like I got a handful of
those and bunch of bunch of little jewels.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have them with me at Emerald and like
when they're gone, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm not, you know, going to be
making more of them or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that as well, because I was
going to ask a question about the dead
[SPEAKER_01]: bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, mostly I was going to say,
do you see it as a potential source for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like future work, maybe like a
new male, but I actually realized a better
[SPEAKER_01]: question is, have you ever been doing a
similar thing, you know, where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: testing out the mail and then you do maybe
not necessarily a dead band, but you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you trial out one of the crosses and it
just catches you off guard and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, shit, I've got to work this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, that happens quite frequently
because like, um, in certain cases you'll,
[SPEAKER_06]: you'll do something and be like,
wow, that didn't work out at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's complete shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the opposite end of that spectrum
of like, holy mother, like that is like
[SPEAKER_06]: far far exceeded what I'd expected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you realize like, well,
Hey, you know, if I could work that a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit better, that could actually
like change the whole duration of the
[SPEAKER_06]: process up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might, yeah, you might end up
wanting to work online a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_06]: and more, you know, to go back out to,
to something else and it would improve it
[SPEAKER_06]: and make it that much better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will, you will run into that,
you know, like both of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff where you're like, ah, it sucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then stuff that's like, wow,
that, that could actually work and improve
[SPEAKER_06]: in something else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like, if you're, you know,
really studying those males and how the
[SPEAKER_06]: gene pairs are like transferring with each
other, um, you know, you can, you can see
[SPEAKER_06]: like a method to the madness and that's
typically how like the improvements go,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would definitely, definitely want to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, if you were going to do a
cubing project, for example, would you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use a male that was very similar
to the female in question or something
[SPEAKER_01]: radically different in order to have
easier differentiation, I guess?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, cause after it's all sudden done,
you're going to have 6% of some genes
[SPEAKER_06]: after, after four back crosses,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it's whatever the, the,
the 6% that you would want left over as
[SPEAKER_06]: well as like how something that was
opposite how it bred into that first F1
[SPEAKER_06]: generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and, you know, I've, you know,
there's two lines of thought with it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I, you know, I can say like,
if you do go the opposite way,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's easier to tell out traits in the
males, you know, for, for the back cross
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, using something opposite,
you know, can make that easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as the process continues, you know,
you're, you're up in the frequency of
[SPEAKER_06]: those genes from the mother that you're
back crossing to or the dad that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: using in a back crossing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you, you know, it really comes
down to like growing out that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that F1 generation very, very,
very thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it can make it tricky if you're using
something that's, you know, maybe looks
[SPEAKER_06]: the same, but acts completely different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I was going to go like the
similarity route, me personally,
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always been a fan of like jumping
back into the same gene pool, maybe not
[SPEAKER_06]: the exact same clones and the exact same
thing, but, but it is the same gene pool,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, might not be that clone and that
exact male or what have you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're already like jumping back
into that gene pool during your,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, your, your first grow out of
this F1 that you're going to try to select
[SPEAKER_06]: a male from after you've looked at enough
of those females, you can see how
[SPEAKER_06]: everything's kind of put together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that'll, you know, can lead you
on your, on your journey to finding your
[SPEAKER_06]: male that you're going to back cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then that's where the improvements
can come in as well, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So say like a green Avenger, if that was
our, you know, if we were going to do that
[SPEAKER_06]: genius project, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we'd want to go with that green
Avenger.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, you know, we're already kind of
there because when we grow out the F1,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, version of that, of course,
it's like very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the backside of it is like,
you have so many of those genes that are
[SPEAKER_06]: already back into that pool that,
you know, you, you might really water it
[SPEAKER_06]: down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like sometimes, you know, not everything
responds the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like you can inbreed something weak,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there's a lot to be said for,
for hybrid vigor too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, there's, there's a lot of
different, different routes you could go
[SPEAKER_06]: with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there's also the line of thought of,
um, using two different males to do the
[SPEAKER_06]: first F1 that aren't related.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if you can have them both in that same
gene pool and back cross two separate
[SPEAKER_06]: lines, um, and at the end of their cubing,
combine them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that, that, like that little 6%
difference on, on both sides, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, can reintroduce like a bit of,
of the hybrid vigor, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so many questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first one, do you think that doing a
few back crosses, let's say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: more extreme example, be Cindy,
where, you know, we've got four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that you've really lost
hybrid vigor at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it takes a lot longer than
that to lose it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it depends, but if you think about it
like this, like say like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're talking about the princess clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you knew it came out of some,
some Jack hair, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got that far.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if you figure that NL5 and skunk are
part of that Jack hair and use NL5 skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: to start your cubing process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so you take NL5 skunk and pollinate
princess with the, you know, that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of, you're back into the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yet you're, you're still quite
different because it's not Jack that
[SPEAKER_06]: you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're using like a two thirds
of the combination.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus you got an unknown male in there too,
perhaps, or you just say unknown pollen
[SPEAKER_06]: donor in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you, um, doing it like that,
I don't think like you'll run it down as
[SPEAKER_06]: hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but say like, if the, say like,
uh, the bud that the seed came out of that
[SPEAKER_06]: you had that clone and some other type of
pollen donor, um, if you started cubing
[SPEAKER_06]: from there, you might actually kind of be
more, more pure before, like you would hit
[SPEAKER_06]: say like that point of like where you're,
you're starting to water down again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so in, in different things act
differently too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we have a skunk at F10, you know,
it doesn't lose bigger, but I've had
[SPEAKER_06]: things that, you know, if you brought them
from F3 to F4, it hit like a big,
[SPEAKER_06]: a big drop off, you know, so different
things are gonna kind of respond
[SPEAKER_06]: differently too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we just jump back to a point you
made earlier in regards to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you, you do your cubing project
with two lines and combine them at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think a lot of the characteristics
that people would consider unique to a
[SPEAKER_01]: cubing process, like I guess most notably,
um, people will say that the more inbred a
[SPEAKER_01]: line is, the more dominant it will be when
you cross it to things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you cross like, you know,
a BX4 to just like an F1, you generally
[SPEAKER_01]: get, you know, more dominance from the
BX4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that in mind, when you said,
you know, you combine those two lines
[SPEAKER_01]: together, technically it'd be an F1,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they got slightly different
genetics, even though very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, would you consider it to still be like
have all the properties of like a cube at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point or more, have like more F1 than
the average cube, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: or like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what you would have, you would have
extremely consistent F1, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like when you did hit that F1 generation,
you, you would have a lot of, a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: good attributes, you know, it wouldn't be
like a poly hybrid F1, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, it would already kind of be kind of be
locked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, you know, technically,
uh, it's still an F1 hybrid just because,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, from both sides, you had 6% and
6% that weren't, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: that weren't that clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you still have that difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you combine and you make the
F1, um, you know, you're, you,
[SPEAKER_06]: you, you've gotten it, you've gotten it
all back, back together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I think from there, like if you,
you know, if that's where you were looking
[SPEAKER_06]: to, to breed from, from there,
like, you know, by F3, like that should be
[SPEAKER_06]: consistent as hell, you know, like you
should really be throwing like the very
[SPEAKER_06]: consistently the same phenotype by F3.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you, you know, if you cube two separate
line, you know, to the same, to the same
[SPEAKER_06]: mother, then combine, make the F1 and
continue to F3 by that point, you should
[SPEAKER_06]: be really, really, really tight,
very tight tolerances at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's what we could only hope all
F1s will become in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That wouldn't hold your breath,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen recently not only the use of
S1s, but even S2s as breeding mothers for
[SPEAKER_01]: a few different breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it something you would ever
consider to do yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be, might be what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, man, it's like, you know,
reversing and filial breeding and back
[SPEAKER_06]: crossing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all that, you know, they're just
like different tools to get to the goal
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're looking to get to.
[SPEAKER_06]: And whatever, whatever tool you need to
use, you know, by all means go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like in the case of the, the clone that
can only, you know, really breed out that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that real stellar potency through,
you know, a reversal, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: that might be what you have to do,
you know, and then, you know, you might
[SPEAKER_06]: have to go the other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other route, you know, with males and
back crossing and out crossing and taking
[SPEAKER_06]: F3 to breed the rest of it, you know,
very consistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might have to take that F3 that
you bred and go to the one that you
[SPEAKER_06]: reversed to say like S2, you know,
to make sure that you're hitting that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If, if you can get it to breed that way,
that is to get that potency as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the devil's in the details with this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you a real example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not an S1 or an S2, but would you,
no, not would you, but let's just say you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to, you have to breed with a
feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to be like a pretty
well-known one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one would you pick out of all the
fems, good clones that have come from a
[SPEAKER_01]: femseed that you're aware of, which one
would you pick, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I just didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you just asking me like if I could pick
like a, like a reversed plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: like which one would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like there's a bunch, there's a
bunch of clones that have come from like
[SPEAKER_01]: fem seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you reckon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one would you pick?
[SPEAKER_06]: For, you said for stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I guess maybe I figured what
you pick would have be based on like
[SPEAKER_01]: something like stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, you could pick up for whatever
reason you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like from like some of the
little side projects and work and like
[SPEAKER_06]: headbands pretty damn gnarly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like doesn't really have any, like what I
would call like bad tendencies to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's well-behaved, yields good,
it's very potent, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So headband's always a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping onto the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess after you finished the kind of
skunk project, is there anything on the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon that you're kind of eyeing off
already as maybe next project?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because like by the time it's all said and
done, like, you know, like I work on
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple things at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like when that's coming to fruition,
you know, there's a bunch of other stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: coming to fruition too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That 187 with the screaming eagle,
that was, you know, that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially trying to make my own
little G13 hash plan of sorts,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So had to make all the steps to get to
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a little bit of a little bit
of an endeavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the 88?
[SPEAKER_01]: The X or something a little different?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's, so I took a Kandahar Afghani
and I pollinated the 88, grew out a bunch,
[SPEAKER_06]: select a male, real, real nice,
you know, very 88 dominant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I hit the airborne G13 with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that made the screaming eagle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the phenotypes of it, you know,
fairly consistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here and there, you'd see that Afghani pop
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it made like a thicker bud,
but the smell, flavor, potency was like
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty true across the board, which I
liked.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was this one in particular that,
and I didn't keep a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I told myself like, no keeping
clones of this run because it's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: make you complacent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're not going to grow anymore
because like, you're just going to have
[SPEAKER_06]: this clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, man, I'll take the clone and
like I'm kicking myself in the ass for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, it had a lot more of the 88
dominance because like that airborne G13,
[SPEAKER_06]: like it's a strong breeder, you know,
and like it really shines through later in
[SPEAKER_06]: the, in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that one in particular had that little
bit more 88 influence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And God, man, it was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, uh, it tastes the rainbow
style, you know, like, uh, like every type
[SPEAKER_06]: of fruit candy, like smell all wrapped
into like one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really, really exceptional.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the flavor of it too, man,
it really coated your mouth, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: stayed and lingering for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, man, this is really nice
and a really nice relaxing chill effect to
[SPEAKER_06]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, very potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, anyways, you know, I was,
I was pretty happy with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So had to continue to keep growing them,
keep growing them until, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I find like the girl that I'm really truly
happy with and, you know, get that part
[SPEAKER_06]: done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, um, I wanted to add
a little more 88 influence into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So knowing that the, the Cinderella 99
male that I had picked out, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: it didn't really take too much away from
the moms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if anything, it donated a little few
good things to it, um, made it a little
[SPEAKER_06]: faster flowering, um, made the,
the bud size pretty, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot bigger than what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but it retained the purple color,
that purpley, grapey smell, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of, a lot of really good things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, very potent as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to take the, uh, I was calling
it one eight seven because of the 88 C 99.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want it, uh, male and hitting the
best screaming eagle female.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that should, that should combine
everything just right for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be real good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I had stuff going on with the
orange project, um, with that orange,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, it was like Calio, Eric 77's Calio
clone to TUC club, skunk one, and then,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, doing a few projects with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, you know, to have the orange
thing and then, um, had some other stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: going on with, um, Oh, the, um,
uh, smuckers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm making some, uh, strawberry stuff
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of, a lot of little wads and
ends, plus the skunks, plus the cams and
[SPEAKER_06]: Kimmy skunks and this and that,
you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, I just kind of figured just
hold back and get it all, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it worked just right and perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I'm real happy with it and then
it'll be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, then there was some other things that
I had thrown into the mix that,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, I had reversed the Kim dog onto a
bunch of stuff too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then hunting through that here lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, uh, that's pretty cool too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which camp, the only 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next question, I guess then is what
do you think about, uh, the idea of like
[SPEAKER_01]: standout phenotypes being associated with,
uh, trifoliation or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whirling phylotaxics soul mentioned that
with the queen of soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen the idea also mentioned by a
few other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just always under the impression
that, you know, the whole trifoliate slash
[SPEAKER_01]: whirling phylotaxy was actually like not
related to like a phenotype per se,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more just something which would have
like, you know, like a probability of
[SPEAKER_01]: affecting each and every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I've seen it go both ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, um, the, the phylotax is like,
as I've seen that have like some adverse
[SPEAKER_06]: effects, you know, um, you'll see it in
certain plants like pop up here and there,
[SPEAKER_06]: but not like consistently like where you
could like apply like the golden mean to
[SPEAKER_06]: it or any shit like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, on trifolates, um, I've always
kind of viewed it as like, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: given the rarity of it, you know,
it's not something you see every single
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that it was kind of like the plants
way of trying to evolve, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: so, you know, I've seen it in certain
cases to where it didn't work out too
[SPEAKER_06]: good, but that's not to say because it was
a trifoliate, you know, could have just
[SPEAKER_06]: been like some shit jeans in the pool,
you know, and that just came out shitty
[SPEAKER_06]: because trifoliate or not, it was just
destined to be shitty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I've also seen it work out very
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once again, I, you know, I couldn't
say for sure, but it, it's also turned
[SPEAKER_06]: out, um, um, to where that did become like
a, a distinguishing trait that you wanted
[SPEAKER_06]: to look for in the males, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, it actually make your,
make your hunt a lot easier if,
[SPEAKER_06]: if that is like what you're kind of
looking for too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have noticed the correlation,
like definitely the trifoliate females,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, were the ones that really,
really, really kicked it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a hundred, a hundred notches.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, ideally you'd want to look for that,
that trifoliate male, and you could
[SPEAKER_06]: actually, you know, if you knew that for
factors, which you would want for,
[SPEAKER_06]: you could sprout pretty huge population
and, um, not take up much space.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I have seen trifoliates
like turn into trifoliates later on too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but a lot of the times, you know,
from the, from the get go there,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they're going to be expressing
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a question I've got, which,
I mean, you could apply to that previous
[SPEAKER_01]: question really perfectly if you want it
is how many generations do you think it
[SPEAKER_01]: would take to be able to breed one very
specific trait into a strain, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: while obviously trying to not fuck up too
much of the other things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, yeah, like if I said,
I've got a strain and it's perfect in
[SPEAKER_01]: every way and I just want to get one new
trade in there, you know, how many
[SPEAKER_01]: generations approximately do you think
you'd be looking at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I said to you, you know,
can you give me an ETA?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what would you tell me is what I'd be
looking at?
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends like, it depends if it breeds
true or not, you know, if it pops up as a
[SPEAKER_06]: recessive then, you know, also like the,
are you looking like for like a,
[SPEAKER_06]: like a clone or are you looking for a seed
line that's like consistently spitting
[SPEAKER_06]: that trait out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess like a seed line.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I've seen it done in one,
I've seen it done in one step,
[SPEAKER_06]: like it just works, you know, but that
doesn't happen a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would depend on what trait,
if it breeds true for that trait or not
[SPEAKER_06]: and the frequency that you see of that
trait and, you know, each generation then
[SPEAKER_06]: monitor the percentage, the increase of
like the, the more desirable trait
[SPEAKER_06]: frequency that you're seeing until you're,
you know, you're happy with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so like if it's like with color,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like they had to be purple,
you know, you might notice could be like
[SPEAKER_06]: more like 30%, you know, showed color in
the F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You took the F1 generation, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you back crossed to the mom and then
you also, let's say you went F2,
[SPEAKER_06]: selected a purple and went to F3.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might grow out the F3 generation and
say, well hell, you know, I'm only like
[SPEAKER_06]: 50-50, you know, even after all that,
I'm at 50-50.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the one back cross, you might've
noticed that you upped it to like 75%,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, purple, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, in that case and say,
well, you know, if the only thing that's
[SPEAKER_06]: truly important to you is that purple
color, I would say, you know, continue to
[SPEAKER_06]: back cross, you know, or, you know,
it might not work that way at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might just say like, yeah,
you know, one in 10, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe purple and then the rest aren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's really hard to get
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's telling you, you know, it's not,
not really breeding true for that trait
[SPEAKER_06]: and it'll take, you know, very large
populations and probably a good,
[SPEAKER_06]: good amount of time before you could
really, you know, breed that true.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the differences in all this is like,
could be a year, it'd be 10 years,
[SPEAKER_06]: man, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And anything in between, it's just kind of
a lot of variables, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a bit of a devil's advocate one
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think me and Gene kind of even
referenced this, the underlying principle
[SPEAKER_01]: in this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you were doing a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you obviously, you know,
you've referenced already your high levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you could only get one in 10
seeds to give what you wanted,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was exactly what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no matter what you did, you could
never get it to be more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you want to release that or not give
it out, so to speak, given it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: not really up to par with your standards?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's, if we're talking like overall
standards, like it was like some straight
[SPEAKER_06]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's going in the trash can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if, if you say like if I was going to
breed something, I want it to be very,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, high yielding and skunky.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, you know, out of every
pack, you're going to get that one that
[SPEAKER_06]: does do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like you have tried to further breed
it and it just does not, it just does not
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you do get, one in 10, let's say
we'll, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the rest are like, you know,
maybe subtle variances of it or maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just couldn't do it and people
wanted it that bad and you were upfront
[SPEAKER_06]: about it, you know, and to say,
look, you know, this is the one that you
[SPEAKER_06]: want.
[SPEAKER_06]: It pops up one in 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, you just tell them,
you know, right off the bat, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is going to be your hunt,
but you should have one out of,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, if you sprout all these seeds,
you know, you'll have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: In that case, I guess it would be cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, as long as it meets all the
other criteria and that you're,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're being upfront about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, I mean, if it's some straight
garbage and it's taking a lot of seeds to
[SPEAKER_06]: find that one, like you probably wouldn't
want to, wouldn't want to let that one go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's throw it in the trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it, it spurs this idea to mine
whereby it's, it's kind of like for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an odd thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way a lot of strains are advertised in
the sense that most strains, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a large variety of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it sits a bit weird with me,
the way four phenotypes all have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost think that it kind of is like the
way in which you are describing things
[SPEAKER_01]: already, you know, like, for example,
if you buy a packet of Blue Dream,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it's really well made,
there's maybe only one particular
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype that's like representative of
Blue Dream and the rest are kind of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're mentioning now, like variations,
maybe even a bit bung.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of feel like that almost
happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it happens a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, um, if they were, you know,
if they told, like, if I was like a seed
[SPEAKER_06]: buyer and I bought them and, you know,
they were like, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is what you get.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I grow 10 of them out and don't see
it, and then if I grow 20 out and don't
[SPEAKER_06]: see it, and it's all a bunch of bunk,
like, I'm going to be pissed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if the guy told me like typical
results are this, this, this, and this,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the one in 50, et cetera, may end up
like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like that, uh, cherry AK 47,
you know, and those guys like even put it
[SPEAKER_06]: to the test.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how many, how many seeds does it take
to get that cherry, cherry Fina and the
[SPEAKER_06]: serious seed dudes, they grew out a
thousand and they found one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were like, yeah, cherry Fina is
about one in a thousand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if everybody had smoked
cherry AK and was like, wow, that's shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they went back, you know,
to buy, you know, packs AK 47,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, you know, and didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be like bombed out, but the thing
is like they didn't advertise it as such.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never knew that was the backstory behind
that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a real, really rare gem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, they ended up doing it over
there just to see, you know, what it,
[SPEAKER_06]: what it would take to find that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was out of a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one strain that we don't mention maybe
as much as we should on the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from serious seeds, Cali missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of people are polarized by the
fact some Afghani genetics were introduced
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think around the two thousands and for a
lot of people that just ruined it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you sit on all of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, how do you view the original
Cali missed at least?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was never really into it, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never, you know, maybe I just didn't get
the right, um, the right expression or
[SPEAKER_06]: quality grow of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: But like in my experiences through the
days, like it just never really appealed
[SPEAKER_06]: to me too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might do a bit of a random question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the best barbecue dish?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, brisket, button, pork shoulder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm pretty, I'm pretty keen on
brisket, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I do like that, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't really get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it's cooked right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yeah, brisket is pretty good,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to the Emerald carp
getting some, some good brisket from
[SPEAKER_01]: barbecue B.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be killer, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna tear it up too.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Starved the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, while we're on the topic of
the Emerald carp, the inside scoop is that
[SPEAKER_01]: you and skunk VA will have a booth
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this true?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be pressing Rosam.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be hooking it up out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we expect maybe a bit of a collab
project in the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's, he's going to have a lot of,
instead of like come dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll have Kim crush, silver Kim and all
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'll be out there and uh,
pressing Rosam like on the spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it should be good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's like an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like come get some fresh Rosam from skunk
VA himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like, that's pretty, that's pretty
darn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some Kim 91 Rosam and that's like your
stoner story to top everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I couldn't think of a better way to
get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me get a little bit of that,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we were chatting about it a little
while ago, Cindy 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got crazy needs for calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a few people message me about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your tips for staying on top of
essentially a plant that's got crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium demands?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what the, like when, when you already
know that in advanced, um, like the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that I mix my soil up, like I got some
pretty good, pretty good sources of
[SPEAKER_06]: calcium that are in there that,
you know, break down, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: nice and slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so it just, you know, it just revolves
to me, you know, trying to facilitate
[SPEAKER_06]: that, um, especially during bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know before I even go into bloom,
like I'm feeding at a heavy dose,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, prior to that, you know, where most
people would, you know, wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't really slam it that early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that way you're kind of, kind of
always like a week ahead of everything,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the beauty in it is like, when you do
take it away, like she really fades out
[SPEAKER_06]: really quick and really nice, you know,
so that's kind of like the good point of
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you use it to like, yeah, time you
fade.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in, um, if you're in,
uh, hydroponics, you know, you just,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, up and up your calcium and shut,
um, you know, I'd say like the week prior
[SPEAKER_06]: to bloom, you know, like where normally,
you know, you wait to be in bloom or,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you would go ahead and give it,
give it that, that little boost prior to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just as a bit of a change of
questions here, resinous males,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is something that's come up
before I got a bit of a specific question
[SPEAKER_01]: about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed when I look at like really
closely at seedlings, when they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: young, I swear I find like little,
almost like trichomes on a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: small ones when they're really young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's like a commonality
thing or is that the same as like,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I grew some of those males out,
they would be males with trichomes on
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I've kind of seen it hit and miss,
you know, cause like the little ones,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cause it seemed like a good
majority of them do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, to what degree.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like, you know, um, they tend to
keep that, that type of characteristic,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, through, through the growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what the, what the males, I mean,
I've, I've never been so lucky as to see
[SPEAKER_06]: like the, the one fellow from Alaska,
he, uh, he constantly finds them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, full on resin rails down the
leaf down the Petty Olston.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's like pretty, pretty nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I can't imagine it would be a
very bad thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, but that that's telling me it's
something, I guess, coming off the,
[SPEAKER_06]: coming off the X chromosome wants to breed
for resin, resin production.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would tell me it's, uh,
it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you be so willing as to say that
you would go for resinous males?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had one, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of somewhat related.
[SPEAKER_01]: How detrimental is it to re-veg a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, I don't think it happens so
much anymore, but some people do struggle
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell the sex of the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll kind of change the light cycle
up and re-veg it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you think this is damaging?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess maybe at the more extreme end
of the spectrum, if you've forgotten to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a clone and you know, you're like
re-vegging like a fully flowered harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's detrimental?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like is the, is the resulting plant gonna
be similar or maybe a bit worse?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think like both ways, like totally
doable thing, but they take time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the case of we just had like the
lower third of a plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we left like a couple of buds on it,
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just going to re-veg it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it takes a long time before you really
get any growth out of it anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that growth is going to be kind
of wacky for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just think it takes, it takes a
little longer for it to really get back
[SPEAKER_06]: into the swing of things before like you
can start taking clones and blooming them
[SPEAKER_06]: again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, cause I think like if you take another
clone too early and throw it in bloom,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, it'd act a little bit wacky on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's just more important just
to give it that, that time, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: to fully, fully re-veg and start throwing
out, you know, more than single leaves and
[SPEAKER_06]: what a mutated stuff, you know,
throughout like some proper fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And become more of a plan again and then
taking clients from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I've, I've re-vegged stuff before
in the past and I have one that we did
[SPEAKER_06]: five times.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just doing it just to see,
you know, like what, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: what happened, like if it got better or
got worse or what, what not.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, it stayed the same
every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be unexpected in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, we're on the topic of
unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kind of of the mindset that some
of the more memorable strains throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: history, or just maybe even ones you've
made are ones that kind of produced really
[SPEAKER_01]: unexpected results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I guess, you know, if you've got one
parent that's chocolate and one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry, you know, you kind of expect
it to be like chocolate, strawberry or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the offspring instead is like rotten
cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that the predictable strains tend
not to be ones that go down in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it seems like that's the case a lot
of times, but it's like the weird ones,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that's, that's the reason why
they're so memorable is they're really
[SPEAKER_06]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I did, uh, Kim dog D and Hindu
Kush and that in theory should produce
[SPEAKER_06]: like a lot of like really nasty,
funky smells.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, they did, but there was one that
popped up and it was strawberry,
[SPEAKER_06]: man, the most strawberry strawberry I'd
ever seen in weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the one we called smuckers,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, totally just blew my mind,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that turned into its own little
and little project, you know, for
[SPEAKER_06]: strawberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like found out it like it's something
that weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't think like, all right,
now if I take this and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: breed it to something else, like,
well, it will retain any of the strawberry
[SPEAKER_06]: fruitiness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or am I going to go back to like rank and
nest?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, we hit it with C99 and it stayed
nice and strawberry and, and good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was like a big, big plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's me know that it can be worked.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started working on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must be a mind reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause my next question was, I've seen a
photo of smuckers, C99 crossed to bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's, what's the deal with bubble berry
and what's the deal with this cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we expect to see more of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just, uh, messing around with it at
the, at the moment, just seeing,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, seeing what all it, what all it holds
as, yeah, it's like old, old bubble berry
[SPEAKER_06]: claim.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it, uh, it's got more of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to explain it really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a pungent, very pungent, skunky
fruity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like that, uh, like that four
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you plan to do any future work with
the bubble berry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, that's an interesting one
that I don't think too many people are
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with, but the ones who are and
the ones I've spoken to extremely fond of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really killer, killer plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, like I'll reverse the 91 onto it as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fixing to start digging through,
through those here really soon too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we jump, back to a comment Bodhi
made in his interview, he said that he
[SPEAKER_01]: thinks the, uh, the hash plant Neville
used in the creation of Skelly was the PNW
[SPEAKER_01]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure you could get that one if
you wanted, you know, have you ever grown
[SPEAKER_01]: it out and do you think that there's any
possible relationship between the two?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sorta, um, I think, so I know the,
when he may, I'll tell you what,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna grab this catalog real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way I'm not guessing, hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it was always my understanding,
like he used that hash plant to make a
[SPEAKER_06]: hash plant, but he also had one that was
just a Northern lights, um, hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that, uh, they're very similar,
you know, very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I guess it maybe goes without
saying that I think Bodhi kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: referenced it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skelly is like a big step up in potency
than what the PNW one is, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we have, uh, out of the 1989 seed
bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hash plant pure says after years of
inventory, breeding and testing,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have decided to offer our famous hash
plant as a pure variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pure hash plant differs from the hash
plant, Northern lights, number one F1
[SPEAKER_06]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is, it is in red strain
possessing the wonderful endocrine taste
[SPEAKER_06]: and hive the original cutting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that tells me like he's, he's talking
about, you know, that, that original,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, Pacific Northwest cutting,
um, the yielding vigor will be less than
[SPEAKER_06]: the hybrid under most conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's like what we were talking about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really, you start inbreeding
something, you lose a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_06]: hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but the quality will be better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this one, this is the one to get if
you're a true endococonis or a serious
[SPEAKER_06]: breeder, you can expect a very fast indoor
finish copious resin in a flat top bud
[SPEAKER_06]: structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when I look at the picture,
that, that looks like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: skelly all, all day long.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, if you look at the, um,
the, um, hash plant, Northern lights,
[SPEAKER_06]: number one hybrid, it looks like,
you know, you just took that, that Pacific
[SPEAKER_06]: Northwest cutting and hit it with a,
you know, one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you could just order some of this
stuff, it'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: The G 13 hash plant, but like,
uh, unless he was making films,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like he couldn't have,
couldn't have done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he said he still has some of
the stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Northern lights five crossed to the NL
two, then he was selling the NL two and
[SPEAKER_06]: enough three.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see what else got the garlic
bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's got a lot of, basically every
building block strain over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, so yeah, I would, I would say
that, um, his hash plant pure was probably
[SPEAKER_06]: like said that, that Pacific Northwest
cutting crossed to one of the,
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the NL crosses that he did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm thinking like the, the one with NL
one or two, probably, uh, bat crossed or
[SPEAKER_06]: inbred somehow with that Pacific Northwest
cutting again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, that's where, where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess the notable thing I find
about Scali and, uh, some other plants is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the aesthetics isn't really the,
the be all end all with these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's a little different for you
because you're quite familiar with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but overall, where do aesthetics sit kind
of in your little hierarchy of attributes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you value it or just given you're
familiar with strains where it's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: not correlated in general, do you not
correlate it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, hell man, like I see, like I can see,
you know, like beauty and all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like, I know what it is,
you know, like, um, certain things,
[SPEAKER_06]: like you said, that Scali, it's not the
most aesthetic thing in the world,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the smell, the taste and the quality
of the stone and everything, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: makes it makes up way, way up for it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and there's other things say like
purple punch, you know, purple or real
[SPEAKER_06]: frosty and kind of worthless, you know,
like in the, in the stone department,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but it looked real pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I'm more of a smell, taste,
quality, type, you know, more so than like
[SPEAKER_06]: the look looks alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess kind of with this in mind,
how can breeders better cater to the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think me and Gene kind of,
we kind of struck on this idea a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and he said something along the lines
of like, there's two major types of
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and Cowleys, the one who pump out
units and the ones who hold onto the rare
[SPEAKER_01]: heirloom strains and basically sacrifice
the crop to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess with that in mind, how can we
try to cater, you know, to the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: pumping out units so that it's not just
blue dream and it's not just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain strains that maybe aren't the
best, like, you know, purple punch,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really have to, you have to start
breeding for, um, yield in mind too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's whether you can breed yield
into something without sacrificing a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if there is some type of sacrifice and
you can reach some form of a compromise
[SPEAKER_06]: with it, like if it's yielding that much,
you know, if it is like commercial
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial units, as they put it,
um, it's normally not very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can make that better,
um, strike a happy medium or go better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think you could do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if, if I was going to do it,
I'd probably be looking more to,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, cater a lot more to the greenhouse and
outdoor dudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they tend to, you know, they grow a
lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and since like the price of a pack in
California for their outdoor go so low,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, you know, they're looking to get it
extracted, you know, so once they
[SPEAKER_06]: extracted, you know, the price went,
went back up, you know, cause the oil that
[SPEAKER_06]: was produced from something that was
greenhouse or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, it's worth just as much as
anything else, as long as the quality is
[SPEAKER_06]: good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you could, if you could offer good
outdoor and greenhouse producers that
[SPEAKER_06]: offer the yield and very high level of
terpenes and be a good quality product,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, with a lot of the pest and mildew and
mold resistance is bred into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like that's where you would have
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then if you're marketing,
say towards, um, like commercial indoor
[SPEAKER_06]: facilities, um, you would be looking for
very short flower times as well as,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the yield and trying to keep the
happy medium.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think like, if you can, you can
shorten your flower times enough,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you can get a whole extra run in
per year, you know, versus the next guy,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're like really on it, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think like that would bring a lot of
value to, you know, commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and especially like if you can give
them that ridiculously high yielding and
[SPEAKER_06]: also like pretty damn potent and stinky
weed, you know, that that would help them
[SPEAKER_06]: out, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one question I personally wanted to
ask was the genius haze, the Apollo haze,
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic line.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first I was wondering, are you going to
work it forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I was like, no, more importantly,
are we ever going to see the gray or haze
[SPEAKER_01]: released in straight form?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really love all the crosses
it's been used in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the females of that like?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they're really, really gnarly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the thing is, is like a body of
mine is the guy who made those.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, unless I think that was
something like he wanted to do,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, he can do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, you know, nobody's heard from him
in a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it kind of, it's kind of,
like half worried about him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened to him,
but, um, yeah, he was the one that made
[SPEAKER_06]: the actual gray haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just selecting a, selecting a boy
out the bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what were the girls like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they just kind of like a bigger
yielding Cindy's?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: More or less like a long, like more like
spear type buds and, um, still really
[SPEAKER_06]: quick flowering time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, a lot of candied type, type smells,
you know, it's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's, here's an interesting one I've
mentioned before, and I'd love to know
[SPEAKER_01]: your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that, you know, often plants
can basically be telling you that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you were to give them,
say a T I externally more nutrients than
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have otherwise had access to,
you know, they, they might have a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it kind of signifies to me,
like, although they might not have been
[SPEAKER_01]: showing deficiencies, like they likewise
could have used more than what they had
[SPEAKER_01]: access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that's kind of the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have I kind of miss analyze something?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see that whole situation?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I've seen it like the opposite
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's not showing a, it's not showing
a toxicity, but you're like stunning the
[SPEAKER_06]: yield, you know, like it's not like Herman
out or like burning or darkening up.
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole lot, but that extra bit of food
caused it to yield less.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I've also seen it,
um, where it yields more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then you got to find out why,
you know, sometimes it has nothing to do
[SPEAKER_06]: with like any NPK values.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times it has to do with a lot of,
you know, like sulfur and magnesium and
[SPEAKER_06]: calcium, you know, um, sometimes it has to
do more with a certain timing of a T like
[SPEAKER_06]: you said, and then also, you know,
like a fulvic and veg or a humic and bloom
[SPEAKER_06]: type, you know, supplement to help it take
it up, you know, and then some plants
[SPEAKER_06]: don't react well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some plants freak out and harm,
you know, like, uh, it's really an
[SPEAKER_06]: individual basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're eating habits and all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, they're generally the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like people, I guess,
breakfast, lunch, dinner, but what do they
[SPEAKER_06]: eat for breakfast?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they eat for lunch and what do
they eat for dinner?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you might have a vegan,
versus a, you know, a meat eater,
[SPEAKER_06]: vegetarian in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, some people don't eat breakfast,
you know, I mean, you got to kind of work
[SPEAKER_06]: with them and tune them over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes you get lucky and you're not
knocking out the park the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you'll try something different,
like feeding it that little more and
[SPEAKER_06]: notice your yield went down or maybe it
went up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what it's all about is
repeating that same grow over,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, over and over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you've really, really tweaked it
and that just takes time and trial and
[SPEAKER_06]: error.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you feel about some of the
organic additives that fall outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the norm of products?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, obviously fulvic acid,
pretty common one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about some of the more, I guess,
kind of exotic things we see nowadays,
[SPEAKER_01]: like insect frass or like chitin based
products or things like mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see on those ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you dabbled with them and would you
recommend them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we use insect frass.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chitins, you know, it's a big help keeping
the immune system rolling and everything
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That in correlation with like alloy water
and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mammoth pee, I tried out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of like it did what it was
supposed to, but it seems like it's like
[SPEAKER_06]: got an enzyme in it or something too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like certain things that made it
want to fox tail out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of figured I was like,
ah, it's probably like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like an enzyme and, you know,
some type of fungal microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you tend to like dabble with all the
new and latest things or are you more kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like just sticking to like the known
and trusted things per se?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I tried to be that guy and try
some things out and it didn't work out
[SPEAKER_06]: good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, it was all right,
but the old tried and true system was
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of went back to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, every now and again,
I'll hear when, but it's normally like
[SPEAKER_06]: through a friend or something like it
said, but, you know, they tried something
[SPEAKER_06]: out and it really, really helped.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's only like a handful of people
I know that I'm really going to listen to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what they have to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so yeah, every now and again,
you know, try something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is kind of your tried and true
staple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's, what's the one kind of
amendment or the one thing in your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: mix that you just think does some serious
good work?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all of it, you know, all that kind of
working together, but the soil mix with
[SPEAKER_06]: the dragonfly, coconut for coconut water
for an enzyme, rotate that with like
[SPEAKER_06]: malted barley for an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the dragonfly and the microbes,
you know, like the lush roots and then
[SPEAKER_06]: supplement and like, you know,
some like juices and some sugars toward
[SPEAKER_06]: the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to work the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so question I've been asking a few
people and I guess you kind of brought it
[SPEAKER_01]: up once or twice already strains that
throw nanas in like the last week or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there are a lot that do it and
they're like, they don't have pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're infertile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really kind of like a no
brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it's not that, you know,
it doesn't affect anything per se except
[SPEAKER_01]: for maybe aesthetics, but the ones that do
produce pollen, it's in the last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that to be like a negative
trait or do you just think, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I guess it's only really a
problem if you had like a plant several
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks behind in flower, you know,
like do you think it's, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, there's a lot of strains
that do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like I, I grow some things that,
that do it, you know, and like they're,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're that good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I cater to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if me and you was running like a big
commercial facility and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have like tables or like a quarter of
the building or a room, what have you
[SPEAKER_06]: comes down.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're breaking plants down,
I mean, the pollen could go over to the
[SPEAKER_06]: the part that's say week two, week three
flower and get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, people end up with the
seeds in their weed and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't, they don't want that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it would be a problem with
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if me and you're just like,
you know, running our little grow rooms,
[SPEAKER_06]: doing our thing and you know, no big,
no big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, like it just depends what
you're, what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be a big problem, but me and
you're just running our grows at our house
[SPEAKER_06]: or where we're running like a monocrop or
something and it all comes down at the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time, you know, that could be fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But ideally, yeah, you wouldn't have it,
but that's just the way it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are, some of them are that
good and they like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you just got to do your best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I dig.
[SPEAKER_01]: So switch it up for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When can the general public expect to be
able to experience local H for themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like smoking some weed of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe growing it themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what like giving a client out,
you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, hell no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It plays like a nice little role on like a
lot of the little breeding projects and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's your answer folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So question I get asked from a lot of
people, cause I think they probably think
[SPEAKER_01]: I ask people the question, even though I
don't include it in the interview,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I include basically everything in the
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically I always get asked the question,
how do you guys source all the old school
[SPEAKER_01]: gems that you work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is it like a crazy seed hunt
expedition or like, you know, how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: go about coming across some of these old
SSC gems, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a lot of that it's like family
heirloom type shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to call it that, you know,
something like passed down to me,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and then you got some old cats
store the seeds up in the freezer and they
[SPEAKER_06]: kept, you know, a long time that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes people get their stuff like
that, or if you travel around a lot and
[SPEAKER_06]: meet and greet people, I guess,
you know, like I've been to like shows
[SPEAKER_06]: before where dudes come out the woodwork
and they're like, Hey, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was growing a bunch of Williams wonder
on the hill for like forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I heard you, you know, you're into
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I made a batch of seeds over a few
years from the original.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes it could happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that or somebody is just keeping a
client around or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of it's just like what we've
what we've had in our life leading up to
[SPEAKER_06]: this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like we just started doing it,
you know, a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been doing a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, ain't no fresh meat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, definitely not the first ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can growers be properly rewarded
for finding killer phenos?
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you have a certain space and you
choose to use that space to entirely
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunt and you sacrifice a large part
of what would have been, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a good crop, how can we as like a
community, like compensate people,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, not like in the literal sense,
but I feel like essentially if over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years, and this kind of goes back to that
point, me and Jean made about people
[SPEAKER_01]: either pumping out units or retaining the
aliens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you do the math over the
years, these people are forgoing a
[SPEAKER_01]: substantial amount of money to do
essentially like, you know, obviously they
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy the weed and enjoy keeping around,
but it's, it is a bit of a community slash
[SPEAKER_01]: a, you know, like a selfless aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how, how do we properly like
thank and or, you know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: like compensate people who do this?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of
crazy on like a lot of levels,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I would say like the number one thing
would be like people that do put in the
[SPEAKER_06]: time to either like do the big phenohunts
and like actually have like that very
[SPEAKER_06]: superior weed or if it's like,
you know, they're growing an old heirloom
[SPEAKER_06]: strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these things, you know,
they don't particularly yield like Blue
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream does, but they sure do smoke a whole
lot better.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the mindset with a lot of the
stores and the dispensary world,
[SPEAKER_06]: like especially like in Colorado is like,
they really want to lowball the hell out
[SPEAKER_06]: of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they want to make out like,
it's kind of all the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: A pound is a pound is a pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they don't want to pay,
pay the grower what it, what it actually
[SPEAKER_06]: is worth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they go and market up like 260%
or something, you know, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: ridiculous, but I think like if you
support good, good farmers, good farms,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, don't, don't be the one to
complain.
[SPEAKER_06]: About, I guess, like the price,
you know, within reason, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're like a, like a distributor or a
store owner or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like that, that would help immensely,
you know, but, you know, if people would
[SPEAKER_06]: reward quality with, you know,
sticking to that or, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, just like with anything
else, I suppose like a good restaurant or
[SPEAKER_06]: what have you, you know, you'd recommend
it to your friends, you know, Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea that jumps to my mind when you
say that is I know of some people who grow
[SPEAKER_01]: some incredibly boutique weed and it's,
it's more expensive than the average
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, you know, there are some
people who get really angry at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, in my mind, it's kind of a bit
like, well, you know, like if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: drive a really expensive car, like that's
kind of your choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not like a car that costs a
hundred thousand dollars is literally five
[SPEAKER_01]: times as good as a car that costs $20,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the scaling isn't linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's probably only like
50% better or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but, but nevertheless,
there are people who want that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my mind, it's like, if you want to
pay for a premium product, like cool,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as long as no one's forcing you
to, but then the naysayers will say,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, but this is different because this
is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I kind of think like,
I don't really see how that works though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you with that same mindset or like,
how do you see that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, if it's, if it's through
somebody's medicine, I think it should,
[SPEAKER_06]: all of it should be like of the utmost
quality, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's for like a truly sick
individual, then they should be helped
[SPEAKER_06]: along with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I ain't talking about like,
you know, I mean like us as like humanity
[SPEAKER_06]: on earth, like we're all sick,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: To some degree or another, whether,
you know, you back eggs or, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're tired or, you know, you're too
jittery or you, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody, everybody's got something wrong
with them, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, if you say like medicine in that
regard, yeah, whatever, but like truly,
[SPEAKER_06]: truly ill sick people that like rely on
it, need it, they should be helped out,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, if it is for like genuinely,
you know, for medicine, medicine,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, it should be the utmost quality and
like the best it could possibly be,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my, my standpoint on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recreationally, I mean, fuck, I mean,
if I was, if I had a weed store or,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, a grow that supplied stores or
both, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe it's just me, but like, I'd want it
to be like the best possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want people to say like, hey,
wow, you know, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I feel like if you're giving me
money, you know, I'm going to give you
[SPEAKER_06]: quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to give you dog shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, like I want to stand out against
my competition who does sling dog shit,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So either way, like me personally,
I'm going to go for the quality and the
[SPEAKER_06]: best, you know, each time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to sacrifice that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I guess, I think kind of the
underlying argument that some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people make in the, you know, the
Australian scene at least is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're producing really high quality
and maybe you want to be compensated for
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it's like, no, you're like obliged
to instead sell for like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: far less to someone who's really sick,
even though you may not like know someone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's sick and like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I think is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I also just think, at least in my
personal experience, I haven't met a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: of like white collar growers and I have a
feeling you need those guys as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, my, my kind of thinking is
that a lot of white collar guys just
[SPEAKER_01]: probably do it for themselves and don't
talk to anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need those people to come to the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if there's pressure that you have
to be doing a certain thing with your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, like it's not going to be
incentivizing people to come to the table,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I said, you know, there's like
varying degrees of like sick, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like when kids I take care of,
like they're reliant on it, like without
[SPEAKER_06]: it, they're most likely would die.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they need it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, and you know, very, very ill,
but then like, you know, I got a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: buddies that like, I mean, they could be
like, yeah, my, you know, my back hurts a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they, they're fine momentarily
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's one thing, but it's yet
another thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, one, it's kids, two,
they're really sick, very, very sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: And three, like family doesn't have any
money because you know, all of it goes to
[SPEAKER_06]: doctor bills if they do got any,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like with them, like I don't charge a
penny, you know, I just give it to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like here it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like if my buddy that like his back
was, you know, whatever, I don't,
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't give a fuck what it was
for.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to pay me and they're going
to pay me good for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's kind of what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another kind of similar thing to what we
were referencing with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like compensating people for finding the
clones is that often you'll hear stories
[SPEAKER_01]: of people being like, Oh yeah,
this, this clone was worth $5,000,
[SPEAKER_01]: $10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and, and the underlying
tone is that's outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, but at the same time,
the person who found that maybe had to do
[SPEAKER_01]: such a big pheno hunt that they forego
like more than that amount of money in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potential crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess what I'm thinking is,
do you see a bit of a cognitive dissonance
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the way I do where it's like,
well, to get these things, you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: sacrifice and you're not willing to make
that sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of do have to compensate in a
way, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think like, now you shouldn't
really charge for clones or something
[SPEAKER_01]: along those lines?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, people are going to pay and
people are going to do and do what they
[SPEAKER_06]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, as long as there are people out
there willing to pay it, people are going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be out there selling it, you know,
like, um, there, there's a lot of things
[SPEAKER_06]: out there that go for astronomical amounts
of money that aren't really, there's no
[SPEAKER_06]: like real hard work into it or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just based off of rarity,
you know, there's a lot of paintings out
[SPEAKER_06]: there that are worth millions of dollars
that frankly, I mean, to me, this looks
[SPEAKER_06]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks like somebody just fucking
threw up goddamn color on a canvas,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but to somebody that's
priceless, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got that end of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you have the other end of it,
I guess, like if it was like, say like for
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding or what have you, you know,
like if it was that rare of a genetic or
[SPEAKER_06]: something or whatnot, I could see like
value in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if like you were making, making a seed
line, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we have to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to grow out a whole lot,
you know, stuff and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of it doesn't turn out that great,
you know, like, I mean, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people would be stoked, but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to me, it was like, you know,
it was just filling up space where it
[SPEAKER_06]: could have been used for something else.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like you take losses there,
but when you do have like your good seed
[SPEAKER_06]: lines and you sell it, I mean,
that's why we charge money for it because,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we had to put money and space
and time into it, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then there's guys that sell like
individual clones you know, flats of
[SPEAKER_06]: clones, I guess, to make their money back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's other people like we used
to do back in the day, we'd make shit that
[SPEAKER_06]: the other guy doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we know he don't got it because he
couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was something very unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in that case, we would hoard the hell
out of the clone and we'd be the one
[SPEAKER_06]: growing the weed and selling the weed and
nobody else had that weed because we had
[SPEAKER_06]: that weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were getting reimbursed in that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems like no matter what,
you know, somebody is going to get
[SPEAKER_06]: reimbursed for it no matter what,
but to what degree, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like there's people that sell like
thousand dollar packs of randomly chucked
[SPEAKER_06]: together seeds and fancy boxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like people, people do that shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was like real rare and maybe it's
like the dankest shit on earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know, but there were people
there like waiting to pay it, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: just because, you know, beauty's in the
eye of the beholder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we jump over to some more
growing style questions, we've seen a rise
[SPEAKER_01]: in popularity of defoliation lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your kind of thoughts on this whole
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you into it or do you feel it's maybe
counterproductive?
[SPEAKER_06]: Depends on what goes back to the feeding
thing and how every plant's kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: different, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Some plants are into it, some of them
aren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are into it, but only at
certain points during the cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've never gone so extreme as like what
I've seen, but I mean, like on headband,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I defoliated, you know,
fairly, fairly heavy in the beginning and
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes even like cut them back just so
that way they'll stack a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: harder, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Certain things that want to stretch a lot
like that and get viney on you,
[SPEAKER_06]: they tend to respond a little bit better
to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could take like that skelly hash
plant, it's a leaf monster, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pull off so much leaf off of that
thing, but I found that it likes it like
[SPEAKER_06]: done at a couple different points,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like pre-flower and then a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it grows too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to pull it off, but it still
wants some, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like it like if you just strip
them all off.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like that at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just depends, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you mentioned earlier you like to
rotate your enzymes in your feedings,
[SPEAKER_01]: be it the aloe, the cocoa or the malt.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you kind of rotate your feedings,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the question I get asked a lot by
people is should you try to like stagger
[SPEAKER_01]: each thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as you referenced, like malt one
time, something else the next,
[SPEAKER_01]: something else the following or a bit of
everything in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's a difference between
the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your breakdown on the situation?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've messed around with a few different
ways from like using nothing but the one
[SPEAKER_06]: thing each grow and then going to where I
was like staggering it and then where I
[SPEAKER_06]: was going like half strength with both,
you know, to kind of combine them and then
[SPEAKER_06]: going with using one and the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had actually read some things saying
that some of the specific cytokines in
[SPEAKER_01]: coconut water may not be all that,
how should we say, advantageous in flour
[SPEAKER_01]: versus say veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever noticed anything like that
or do you find coconut water in flour is
[SPEAKER_01]: still good?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think like a lot of the simple
sugars and carbohydrates that are in it
[SPEAKER_06]: help with the terpene production a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I'd be more inclined to use like
make sure that I was using like the
[SPEAKER_06]: coconut water like later, you know,
like mid bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in some of your posts, we've
started to see more and more reference,
[SPEAKER_01]: including other people as well,
the VA Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what can you tell us about this
one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's just a really old Afghani,
like Afghani one cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like we've, like I know I've
talked to a couple of people that were
[SPEAKER_06]: going to VCU college, like downtown
Richmond, like the very early eighties
[SPEAKER_06]: that were smoking that same bug and the
same crew of dudes that were kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: running around and growing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just really old.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really piney, like eucalyptus pine,
sagey, sandalwoody, you know, very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very funky, but it's really, really
potent, you know, and very heavy and
[SPEAKER_06]: dense, dense weed too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was always a good grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: The potency on it was like real top notch,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you plan to breed with it at all?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Been doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just haven't really been talking about it
yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to make everything like a big
surprise for everybody, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've probably already said too much,
but so.
[SPEAKER_02]: When can we expect a grand unveiling?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I reckon whenever, whenever it's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shouldn't be too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in recent interviews, we've brought up
the topic of the Brothers of Eternal Love
[SPEAKER_01]: and how, you know, their stock is kind of
similar to the SSC regarded, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely highly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had to choose between the two,
you know, I know that they're not exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: apples to apples, so to speak,
because, you know, like Bowe didn't make
[SPEAKER_01]: packs of seeds, but if you had to
metaphorically choose between a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowe and a pack of SSC and it could be
either of either, you know, what would you
[SPEAKER_01]: pick?
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on what it does, you know,
but I'd like to think I'd get with the
[SPEAKER_06]: Brotherhood stuff, you know, a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of like European stuff
revolved around American stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they got took back over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to think like the Bowe and the
sacred seeds, you know, Mendojo and those
[SPEAKER_06]: cats, like I'd like to think like there's
a little more stout, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a little more, a little more hardcore.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like SSC, man, like they won't,
they didn't produce no slout shit either.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a tough one, but like certain
things, you know, I would definitely be,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, looking at the seed club stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, like if you, you know,
had a gun in my head, maybe pick one,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd go with Brotherhood shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are there any clones out there
currently that you would love to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you know, they're about,
but you just haven't got for one reason or
[SPEAKER_01]: another?
[SPEAKER_06]: William's Wonder, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really good William's Wonder would be
nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, that's probably,
probably about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few posts of that popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's all legit or maybe
there's a few people who think they have
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but they don't have it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen any or smelled or smoked
any in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, shit, man, ain't no telling.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine like, you know,
that stuff's pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would imagine like people kept some
clones rolling, you know, I'd find it hard
[SPEAKER_06]: to believe that it, you know, is extinct
extinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you had to pick just one clone
that you felt had the most potential to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed with, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess by that, I mean, it pairs well
with just like such a variety of different
[SPEAKER_01]: males, you know, you just consistently
produces good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's your one clone?
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as like a male to cross to or
female?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just works well in all the
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, there's certain ones,
it's like you can take it to the bank and
[SPEAKER_06]: count on it, you know, like producing a
certain result.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's other ones that like,
you could get like such a varied result or
[SPEAKER_06]: you could end up with 10 different other
things to work on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I was looking for like the old
faithful or if I was looking for something
[SPEAKER_06]: to give me a multitude of variety,
you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really hard question,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how about another one that just came
to mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all the females you work with,
what's your go-to female for when you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to cross a male to you know, like we
referenced it earlier, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're going to cross a new male to
something in a project, but you've always
[SPEAKER_01]: got that one standby where you know how it
reads, you know, what's predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use it as like a calibration
reference almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: What female is that for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can, like local H is real good about
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's a couple of them that
are really good because like, I know like
[SPEAKER_06]: if it can dominate over something from a
particular cross, then you know that I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: doing pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if that's my goal is to, you know,
have a male that's a little more dominant,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that local is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it can tell me a whole lot about
what something's doing with structure
[SPEAKER_06]: especially.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if I'm running down a
particular set of genes, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it can tell me a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, another little personal question I
wanted to sneak in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's detrimental at all to
have a male in your flowering room from
[SPEAKER_01]: flower day one such that essentially,
you know, the first pistils that are
[SPEAKER_01]: emerging on the females are going to be
pollinated fairly shortly after that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the door as soon as they emerge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do you think that's detrimental at
all just because the common thing which,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I even say to people when they
ask me is, you know, ideally you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate the females around week three,
week four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, probably introduce the male
into the room around about that time which
[SPEAKER_01]: is obviously counter to what I just
mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about it all?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you know, different females are
going to have different flowering times.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all have their own peak time,
I would say, like to get overall
[SPEAKER_06]: saturation, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, with your male, it's going to be the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some males that are very fast that
are actually faster than the females.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he's already dumping pollen by the
time that they're just getting like tiny
[SPEAKER_06]: popcorn buds, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That and me personally, that would be too
early, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you're making beans for
yourself, like just fucking around,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like if you were doing it in a
production type thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: that wouldn't be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you'd want them a little further
along.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you'd really have to know when does
your male start to actually drop pollen,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can kind of gauge that versus
like the peak time on the females that are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to go in and then know when to bring
them in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because certain ones, there was like a
certain sativa male in the past,
[SPEAKER_06]: you would have to put it in almost a week
ahead of all the females, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's another one that I can't
put in the room till like day 14 of bloom
[SPEAKER_06]: for the females, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's some that go in on the same
day, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you got to really have it timed out on
how your boy is to know like when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to hit your peak sack of the peak
saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think is the peak
saturation from most plants in the sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've heard pretty wildly varying
figures in terms of like the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds you can get off a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's got a lot to do with the
size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, often people will talk about a
plant in a certain size pot and that helps
[SPEAKER_01]: to give a little bit of frame to the whole
metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people say you get 15,000 off a
plant where others will say for the same
[SPEAKER_01]: size plant, you'll only get 1.5 thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one, it's not just how many there
are.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the quality of the ones that are
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're too late going in, you could end
up with 30,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, 20,000 are good,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're too early, you know,
you might end up with 10,000 really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really perfect ones and not the first dud.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is like a balance, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think like if you hit the plant at
the right time, I mean, you can get a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of them and have them all be good at the
same time, you know, if you're giving them
[SPEAKER_06]: the right nutrition and trying to
facilitate seed production type food,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have some really nice seeds and a
whole lot of them, 15,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: 20,000 is not that, you know, it's not
that unfathomable to have on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would be your advice for helping
to supplement the seeded plant's nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: demands after it has been pollinated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems as though the nutrient
requirements for a seeded plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably about on par for a flowering
plant, at least from what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you know,
it seems as though you can certainly keep
[SPEAKER_01]: a seeded plant very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's maybe a little bit of a
misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that seeded plant will just
look shit or maybe like they use it to
[SPEAKER_01]: give credence to the fact that their plant
looks shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, like they should look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like when I make seeds,
like a lot of the stuff, it looks just
[SPEAKER_06]: very similar to the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when it's unseeded, you know,
like very, very fat and swallow cowlixes
[SPEAKER_06]: because there's actually seeds in it
instead of the swelling, lots of resin,
[SPEAKER_06]: lots of stink, you know, everything's
right on point with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always been under the thought of
like, I mean, you're reproducing,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and, you know, new life is being
created.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only is it being created, but it's
being created at like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 or 20,000 fold that you would want to
facilitate the building, the DNA building
[SPEAKER_06]: blocks as much as possible, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So think like the amino acids and heavy
emphasis, not so much on the NPK side,
[SPEAKER_06]: but a lot of other smaller things that go
unnoticed like tend to help facilitate the
[SPEAKER_06]: seed making as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boron's a real big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you know, and like I said,
you know, keeping a good steady diet or
[SPEAKER_06]: that type of stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty moderate NPK seems to, seems to do
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what would be your advice to people
who feel like they've got a pretty solid
[SPEAKER_01]: grasp on organics, but are really looking
to take it to the next level, whether it
[SPEAKER_01]: be, you know, in general, maybe they're
looking to get a bit more out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, you know, like what's kind of your
advice maybe in terms of resources to look
[SPEAKER_01]: up, products to look into, things like
that, you know, like what's some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: more advanced stuff that you feel can help
people take their game to the next level?
[SPEAKER_06]: I really feel like the most simple
approach is always the best in that a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of it really falls into your environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like you were saying earlier,
really tuning your plant, knowing exactly
[SPEAKER_06]: how much it wants to eat or not eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, like you were saying,
like you got a plant, it doesn't show any
[SPEAKER_06]: deficiencies at all, but you know,
had you fed it that little more,
[SPEAKER_06]: it would have doubled in size,
what have you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, vice versa with the one that's not
burning, but you know, it's being overfed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't, doesn't want to blow out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I think a lot of it has to do with
like one's tuning to a plant and then also
[SPEAKER_06]: their environment, you know, making sure
the environment's real nice temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: He better do wise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, light intensity is also a big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people overkill their,
their plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, um, you know, if you can get like
a little cheap light meter, play around
[SPEAKER_06]: with that a little bit, that tends to
help.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, as far as like nutrition wise,
like, uh, like I'm pretty sold on the
[SPEAKER_06]: dragonfly stuff, man, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I used to like make my own little teas
from scratch, you know, raw amendments,
[SPEAKER_06]: but like the dragonflies taking it up,
you know, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like quite a substantial notch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I'm real big on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and grow stones and everything to the
soul.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, when you're not breaking the root ball
up and tilling it all up, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say like I'm doing no
till, but I mean, essentially,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, yeah, you know, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just remember, I just remembered how
you were like, ain't no no till going on
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a really good accent too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as it turns out, we're down to like
our last few questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first one, I've been asking everyone
over the past few months, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like died off a bit, but it's,
I think it's still a bit of a pertinent
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should you ask for permission?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's give the most extreme example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, obviously given you've got a
good relationship with MassG, this would
[SPEAKER_01]: never actually happen, but let's just say
you went to recreate a batch of Grim Dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for whatever reason, he contacts you
and says, Oh, I'm really not comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: with you doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be enough for you to not do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, like, do you feel like you
need to respect someone's intentions to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where like it could literally
stop you from making something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you sit on that issue?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, me personally, like, you know,
I have a respect for people and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was raised pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like me personally, I'd be like,
yeah, without a doubt, you got it at 86.
[SPEAKER_06]: That moment, you know, um, I know a lot of
people don't, you know, cause like they
[SPEAKER_06]: don't, their circumstances are different
than mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if the guy, the guy who,
you know, popped the seed that found the
[SPEAKER_06]: client is also the same dude that gave me
the client, the whole reason I got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, you know, I'm going to respect that,
you know, but a lot of these guys,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they, they scored their client
off of a forum from a guy's guys,
[SPEAKER_06]: cousins, uncles from Maui and Oregon's
finest fucking underground brotherhood,
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy shit, you know, he doesn't know him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's never met him, you know, probably
just doesn't give a fuck, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that guy, you know,
it's different than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can say with me, you know,
always got a, you know, a line of respect
[SPEAKER_06]: for, for people, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good game plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next little question I think you'll be
able to help me resolve is after
[SPEAKER_01]: discussing it with a few people,
the consensus seems to be that the Joshi D
[SPEAKER_01]: OG is the ghost OG, but it's not the TK,
but people seem to be suggesting that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably an S1 of the TK.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that all sound to you in terms of
like correctness, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_06]: Should have found that man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I always thought that they were all
the same, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, um, yeah, maybe, maybe they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, cause like, I've never been able to
like, uh, so like if it was, let's say
[SPEAKER_06]: like Josh D comes up and he's like,
Hey buddy, here's this, this, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: OG Kush, you know, I want you to,
you to grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if he told me like, yeah, this like,
you know, we had a buddy that held onto
[SPEAKER_06]: the clone and called him ghost and you
know, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They run through the story and it tells me
like, yeah, it's the same clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a different name.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be like skunk VA chem dog,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really, it's come dog, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, there's something else
attached to it, but you know, you could
[SPEAKER_06]: say it's like, yeah, it's the same client.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if he gave that to me and then say
like cornbreads like, Hey buddy,
[SPEAKER_06]: here's my TK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I grow it now?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can grow them side by side,
then maybe I could, I could answer that
[SPEAKER_06]: better, but I've never had that that
happened so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, it's weird too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like, you know, people's like gross
style and stuff like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can smoke something and it tastes
completely different than the other guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're growing like the same shit,
but you know, they have a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: different way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes things express a
little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's always, it's real, real hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's actually quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The differences from person to person
where it's at the point where even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: run in all the same strains as say your
mate, like you're going to kind of have
[SPEAKER_01]: your own weed in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, like it's, you got your
own little fingerprint of growing almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one question I wanted to ask you was,
do you have like a cut of Northern lights
[SPEAKER_01]: or like something akin to that that you
use or you just never interested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's never really come up when we've
been chatting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, like Northern lights,
it's like one of them things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if somebody like offers it to me,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm always real leery of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like sour diesel or something,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, ah, you know, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like that's, that's another little,
another little project that's going on at
[SPEAKER_06]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said all, all in due time,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All in due time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneaky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very sneaky.
Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, I was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, lucky last question for today,
at least, is would you and should other
[SPEAKER_01]: people use Cindy 99 as a male more so than
a female in any breeding projects they're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I think of that is
because all the females are consistently
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal and you know, the males are
basically just male versions of the
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's really like no guesswork in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it seems like, it seems like,
yeah, like you're just going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: killer male no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that in mind, would you not want
to use it as a male in the cross because
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the guesswork out of finding a good
male?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, I mean, it's, it's a pretty good
place to start and like anything that's
[SPEAKER_06]: been inbred, you know, heavily that still
produces like really killer female
[SPEAKER_06]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, you know, fairly consistent,
you know, that's, that's going to help you
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like skunk one, you know, that was like
bred to like F4, you know, that was,
[SPEAKER_06]: that was a great one to use, you know,
that's why it was like a pretty good back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the Northern lights that were
worked the same way, it gave you a pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: predictable outcome in that F1 generation,
you know, and then the rest of it was kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of working up to you, you know,
either filial breed it or that cross it or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever you were going to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, my experience with the one that I
had selected was it wasn't taking anything
[SPEAKER_06]: away from the, from the mother and the
offspring, you know, it was just kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: adding adding some good, some good notes
to it, you know, so that that was nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't like overly dominating,
which to me is like, kind of important,
[SPEAKER_06]: like if you're making like F1 because,
you know, the mother's like, it's got so
[SPEAKER_06]: many good qualities that you really want
to retain, could go that route and just
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of enhance it a little bit,
you know, it's going to change some,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, but you retain a lot of those
high notes from the mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a, you know, pretty good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought of actually a sneakier last
question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully this one will make you laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, we got the newest high strain on
the scene in my opinion, and it's somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: related to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to have an opinion
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Chem D and the cooks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel like betrayed in a way?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had, so like my body, he stays up in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got it held onto my Chem D cut for me
for like fricking ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: He made a form cut cookies and pollinated
it with the Chem D like a hot minute back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're nowhere like, they're not the
same type offspring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that GMO is like kind of,
kind of garlicky funky, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is like turned out like, it was really
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like one of the times where like it
was a cookie hybrid and I was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was actually pretty, pretty damn
good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually liked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I see collective and skunk,
you know, they did the, the chem scout,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and I was pretty good too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like they go, they go pretty,
pretty good together, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when can we expect the GMO cube project
to be done?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's somebody else to do right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, any comments, shout outs,
anything you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just thanks for, uh, thanks for having
me on again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And um, yeah, I mean, if I get to doing
shout outs, it's just too many people,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's locked it all into everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, a little patience down
south and, um, dragon fly earth medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: and yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, come by to see me at,
uh, emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's, uh, booth 92 is going to be
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to come say hi to me and skunk
VA and get some raws and get seeds or just
[SPEAKER_06]: come by and shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever's clever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on through.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we have it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part two done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoyed it like I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, big thank you to 420 Australia,
OGS and our Patreon sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned for more content soon and be
sure to check out Duke and Skunk's booth,
[SPEAKER_01]: the emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you there.
Lalalala.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lalalala.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lalalala.
