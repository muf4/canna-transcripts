[SPEAKER_00]: future, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, friends, we are back for another
exciting episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this one, we're joined again by the
head honcho of canner exotics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the land race lover, a big welcome back
part two with the resin master,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gooey Breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And God bless everybody who's giving their
time to come in and say hello to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to this old fool Gabon.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first question of the day,
what have you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just before I got onto this, I was smoking
some Mom, Mom Gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always smoke some Mom Gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always start off with Mom Gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'll tell you, here's the reason why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get right into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gooey is one of those things that's a
little bit configured different than most
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just one of the plants that
came out of that run that was just so
[SPEAKER_01]: unusual and different and unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found is, is that it has a
couple of different qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only runs about 18 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's not a, you know,
a thumper as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people always comment how strong it is
and how much stronger it feels like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because of the arrangement of
all of the different chemicals that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: Gooey that line up just so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives it that perfect mix between
body and mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can feel it in different ways and
at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, it has that effect of being kind of
exciting in the morning and mellowing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got it all as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can exacerbate all of those
by going ahead and adjusting the picking
[SPEAKER_01]: times because it has a wide window.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can let it go as late as 10
weeks, which is really long for that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because you normally start harvesting
about six and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, oh, yeah, it's a very fast
plant, which is something I like and which
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I build into all of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really try and make them quick because
turn around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to get it going next.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, yeah, Gooey is always a
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we can take some of these things
like this and we'll turn it into these
[SPEAKER_01]: purple, beautiful black things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just let all that go and just
keep on going and getting to work and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that black stuff I just showed you is
the latest thing that people have been
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Black Racker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is amazing smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the taste that you would just die
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel the nice warmth of a nice
balanced high that comes from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about it and I'm happy
to bring it and add it to the black lines
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm developing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing is to take that big ass
bud that I just showed you and convert
[SPEAKER_01]: that size and structure from the other
into that and get rid of everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: about that big bud, because basically it's
a cute little smoke that means nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the structure is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to use that and turn
other varieties that have everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: give it that structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way it'll be good for one of
the... I was developing for... This is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like an offshoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was developing for a company in Colorado
that's coming up with automated harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted me to design plants that
were applicable to that machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the designs that we're
going to give to them, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: replace all the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And except for that structure,
because it's easy to trim and it was quick
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good things about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wasn't good smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've been smoking lately
is those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been enjoying myself browsing your
Instagram quite heavily over the past few
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that the Syrian you were posting
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a Syrian.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost gotten 20,000 likes on that
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible looking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a gift given to me to try those
genetics from over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of tend to think this is more
of a service crop for multiple things,
[SPEAKER_01]: not really so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been... I don't think it was
developed for drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was more for other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use it for various other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this was a higher CBD,
lower THC, has a nice smell, has a
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasant kind of a oldie, folksy kind of a
taste to it that you remember from way
[SPEAKER_01]: back when, when dope wasn't very strong,
which I really kind of want to get into a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: People look back and they say,
oh, back in the day, all the old ties and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that you used to have like this one
here, which is a very old tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were so much better and so much
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just... For the time,
they were the strongest there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hadn't experienced... When you
were used to three and four and six
[SPEAKER_01]: percent THC and brick weight, then all of
a sudden you come up with something from
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii that's 10 and 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to knock your socks off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was kind of how it was with the
those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But intervention over time, breeding with
people doing selective breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've gotten those THC numbers up
artificially.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not happen in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature kind of goes the opposite
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man has selected that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just got to keep that boat cruising
right along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, brought up the tie there
because I wanted to ask you, I'd seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your new creations, you were using
a parent that I think you just labeled as
[SPEAKER_00]: old tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a new one or something you've been
using for a while?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's actually a blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a tie cross with a pineapple tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the old tie was basically a pretty old
variety that I had had around in storage
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made some seeds to kind of just
keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it hadn't really worked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I started growing this out again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the black tie that came from that
set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a it's a traditional look.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the way that, you know,
they used to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how I remember most ties
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the best example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within the genetics, there are better
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to just slowly draw those
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, the pineapple, I thought was
really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem with the pineapple pie
was is that the pineapple smell and flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: came in really strong at week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by week five, it's kind of gone
on and drifted on something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a fix for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, recently, we had some guests on
who have been maybe working with tie
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things was which sort of
came out regularly was people talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: this love for the Colombian influence in
the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, in the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been talking about haze in the
tie and the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I'm interested in hearing
from you is, do you see a lot of tie
[SPEAKER_00]: expression in your haze lines or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, the old Mendo haze
mother, which is like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a dozen years old now, I use her all the
time as in a whole host of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because the heavy tie expression
she's got, it's lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, you know, it spreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of, you know, it's got a
lot of lowland tie kind of expressions to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen, from what I remember
back in the day, too, same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only this one plant out of this set from
the old Hayes Brothers stuff that was up
[SPEAKER_01]: from a guy up in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just phenomenal in its expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I every time you know,
people hear me say that they kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time they actually smell it in
person and see it in person, it blows
[SPEAKER_01]: their mind because it's so pungently lime
vodka.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, and it gets all it gets
the resin structure and the high bright
[SPEAKER_01]: turps from the tie side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see a lot of it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I and that's one of the reasons why I
like using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I like using it is because
this this guy when he did it, he trained
[SPEAKER_01]: it so that it was a Mendocino harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he went for a quick harvest time
because they get rain up there faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he selected for that before he passed
on God bless him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we we now celebrate his his work with
that one plant in the arsenal is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was the only one I found that was
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was an exceptional thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I tell people you got to search
through all those seeds to find that
[SPEAKER_01]: really special one, and then hold on to it
and use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I use the old Mendoz Hayes
for a lot is amplification, it has the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to go in and take another strange
turp and bring it forward and louder in
[SPEAKER_01]: that own expression in its own expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't overwhelm it, it may add a
little tinkering at the end, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not going to be something that
overwhelms that in all cases, not in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cases, it will overwhelm it, you know,
and that's just what you get in breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when I breed, I want that
spread because my people are breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, and they want different
phenotypes to select from, they don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: to get locked into something, something
that's already been worked, that's their
[SPEAKER_01]: job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, so I want to give them that
spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just really so great for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use it as an amplifier to bring all
kinds of different turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want a nice gassy smell
or something like that, and well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can make it so that it looks,
you know, when you walk in a room,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of spilled gas all over yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you even do it siphoning?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no, it's a, it's, it's definitely
a useful product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that the tie is,
is responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear someone who's very fond
of gas by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very reassured to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you brought up an interesting
discussion point there about the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like in the past few years,
gas has really come back into fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the popular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm wondering, do you ever get
people who are like, Hey, I want some
[SPEAKER_00]: gooey breeder that smells like pure gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I get it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, no, because that's not
what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, and I'll tell you why, because mostly,
and this is a good, good thing to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into, because I was going to bring up
gases and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gases have only been popular since about
the late eighties when they first started
[SPEAKER_01]: showing up in breeded material.
[SPEAKER_01]: When breeding first started to kind of,
everybody started to realize that,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, you know, a plant that's three feet
tall can be worth $50,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all of a sudden they started to
get that, you know, and that's why now you
[SPEAKER_01]: see this proliferation of breeders who
frankly probably could, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: stand to do a little more education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and stop and get to know their stock
better a little bit first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I always preach, know the
backgrounds of your material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you have that fully in your
mindset before you start crossing with
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to know both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know intimately both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I always tell people
microbreeding helps you to learn those
[SPEAKER_01]: things a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot gets through it a lot safer and with
a more predictable outcome than these
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are coming about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons the gas is so
prevalent is because the gene pool has
[SPEAKER_01]: been narrowed down so much with people
using other people's stuff that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're talking grow setups and
millions of dollars in investment and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about in this modern age,
going with a tried and true that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sold and produced as well before
is a smart thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the surface, but everybody's doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden now people are
starting to see a glut in pot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to see a backlog of,
I know several professional growers who
[SPEAKER_01]: still got last year's crop that they've
got in storage that they haven't been able
[SPEAKER_01]: to turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just because their shit's like
everybody else's that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to fix that, come up with new
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to come up with new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to do that is to use new genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's where the sticking point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really difficult for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people aren't me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was a nerd weed nerd from way
back and I saved a lot of stuff and I had
[SPEAKER_01]: people go out and get a lot of stuff that
came from point of origin and did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really contributed a lot to the
ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I never integrated the mainstream
stuff into any of my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when anybody gets any of my work,
they're getting something that isn't in
[SPEAKER_01]: the gene pool as a whole, unless
somebody's used my work before because
[SPEAKER_01]: these are composites, a lot of different
stuff I've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really important thing when
people are trying to make a name for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves in this business and become,
I'm at the tail end of it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired, I'm old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to last that much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit will kill me here, you know,
one of these days soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, that's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the new people coming up, they need to
start seeking out those pocket grows and
[SPEAKER_01]: those pocket areas in the world that are
still enclaves of good genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps they don't meet up to today's
standards, but they hold the recessives
[SPEAKER_01]: that when bound with the stuff that
they're growing now and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: can awaken new stuff that's buried deep
and can't come out any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to drive this stuff forward the
way that, and that's why background
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge is so important for the strains
because a smart breeder can therefore know
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly which directions can know exactly
which, well, I should say exactly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but approximately to a good degree,
what's going to become dominant out of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things and what, you know,
if he's tried to dig out something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been there from the past that hasn't been
seen in a long time, find something else
[SPEAKER_01]: that has that genetic in it, you know,
that's not expressed, made them and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: it forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden it'll be right there
for you to use, then make it dominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it's not hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, people just need to take the
time to do it, but it's going to help the
[SPEAKER_01]: new breeder in this day and age separate
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a tall task because you can't
live my history.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody that can start right now
and have what I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's scary and it's unfortunate,
but it's just cold hard fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another scientific fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I like to get my stuff
out there to breeders to get it out into
[SPEAKER_01]: there, to start improving that gene pool
or to change it at least to something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's different that they can market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, having said that, I want to get into
the dispensary thing and what dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: are taking and what they're being driven
by because that's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: is causing this bottleneck of genetics
that people are using because dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to take everything that
everybody grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's ARI, if it's, they don't want it,
but I got to tell you, I have a soft spot
[SPEAKER_01]: for ARIPOT and I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's more important that the
customer have the availability to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it than not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is when you smoke a bowl
and you're smoking, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you just insert the dispensary weed in
there and put it in there, it's a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: hard nug and you put it into a bowl,
you fire it off and you have a few hits,
[SPEAKER_01]: great hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are wonderful hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the bowl down, walk away doing
something else, come back a little while
[SPEAKER_01]: later, think you'll finish the bowl and
you start smoking that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is that same buzz?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you vaporized all the stuff that
was in there in those first few hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you got a really good strong hit
and now it's just converted and past tense
[SPEAKER_01]: and you are not getting what you had in
those first few bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who wants that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have always advocated and it's true
proof in fact that your THC levels are
[SPEAKER_01]: more steady in looser pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus you get the chance to be able to load
up maybe two bowls instead of one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the flavors there all the time and you
enjoy it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks nice when you're getting,
instead of getting a little nug like this
[SPEAKER_01]: that costs you 50 bucks or whatever it is,
you get an actual baggie that has some
[SPEAKER_01]: substance to it and you feel like you've
gotten something and it's more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: When have you ever gone into the
dispensary and seen these nugs and seen
[SPEAKER_01]: the full crystals that you see on let's
say my plants that are on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: those crystals, I guarantee you those
crystals are still there on this bud when
[SPEAKER_01]: it hits wherever it hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not there when those super dense
hard buds that they take and they've
[SPEAKER_01]: processed and they've rolled first to take
off so that you you're missing all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be the customer's choice to
be able to have that dense weed or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to change that is to make
looser weed more marketable and more
[SPEAKER_01]: palatable to the public and make them
understand that this is to your benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to remember things that you
haven't had since your first time smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not, you're going to
experience things for the first time that
[SPEAKER_01]: are you're going, wow, that's really
something, you know, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've you've tried some of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm talking about as far as
flavor goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, they aren't real super
dense, but they're they're they're driven
[SPEAKER_01]: towards that end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your enjoyment I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I want every breeder to
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why this is so important to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it is so important to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to change the public
perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be able to open up those
avenues for more rows and be able to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that they can still afford to make,
you know, their payments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, just got to make good plans
to produce well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drive the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry needs to understand that that
everything that's done in a conscious
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder's effort is for the customer's own
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they get that, we're on a
compatible road together and moving this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant forward to the next phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't even know what that next phase
is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've taken it as far as I'm
going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you right now, I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I wholeheartedly agree with
everything you've said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish we could snap our fingers and
make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that in mind, I've been thinking,
you know, how can we get this message out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the masses and the common sort of
feedback I hear from people who work or
[SPEAKER_00]: own dispensary is that everything's so
driven by numbers and names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you're, you know,
very aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question becomes, do we try to
market the benefits of what you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing to the individual consumer
who's maybe not so plugged in or are the
[SPEAKER_00]: store owners and employees the
gatekeepers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, you're talking apples and
oranges because the gatekeepers,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, you know, they have a job to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have tasks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have taxes to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have overhead to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got everything that they've got to
deal with as normal business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some in the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis business is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The onus on the owners of those places is
just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really an overburdened
institution to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, having said that to deny
the customer, the choice is to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: the greater sin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that maybe this little talk
will have somebody, just one person,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just experiment and try what I'm
saying, maybe find a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that gets tell two friends that
they tell two friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got to, you know,
you've lit a fuse and that's what you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to try and do again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for their benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing to gain from advocating
something that isn't going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially viable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than knowing that somebody was ended
up enjoying it more than they would have a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that's how I look at this
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't look at it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my flaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My flaw is, you know, I'm looking out for
the customer over my self-interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes back to you, I believe it comes
back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having said that, you got to put food
on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, it's a really hard thing to
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think again, a grandma pot is a
grandma pot in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that gram, you know, is this big or is
it this big?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know these people have storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they could store, you know,
this kind of stuff and packaging comes
[SPEAKER_01]: into play too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, getting creative with the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see earth friendly packaging as
much as possible, you know, but again,
[SPEAKER_01]: it all comes back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes into keeping that bud secure
until that person tears it apart for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I just really think that the
customer has a benefit from being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: have that choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they should have that choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of young kids these days
who won't smoke loose bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, they look at it and they laugh,
you know, roll it up for them and pass it
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, Oh damn, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's that thing you just went
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's talk about this, you know,
and then you get them into conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: before you know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're advocating, you know, along your
lines and they're passing over and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, all of a sudden they're telling you
that they're going to that bag that you
[SPEAKER_01]: gave them over store bought stuff until
that bag is gone before the store bought
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that they spent money on is that
then you know, you've done your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The empty, the empty jar tells no lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the, one of the questions which
I often hear discussed in this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: general conversation is that like,
it would be great to get these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, really unique weed varieties to
people, but because of the numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes it challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess what I'm wondering is,
do you think it's possible to retain the
[SPEAKER_00]: unique elements of some of these more old
world plants, but maybe bump the numbers a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, not necessarily to like 30% or
anything, but just enough to get people
[SPEAKER_00]: more interested while retaining those
special characteristics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, you know, it's really all
about the uniqueness of, if somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't ever felt this arrangement of THC
molecules and the way that they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: the caranoids are just all arranged to
where they, you know, are different than
[SPEAKER_01]: they've ever felt before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets their attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mom always gets people's attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's 38 years old this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: She always, gets people's attention
because it feels different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be arranged different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to arrange things
different is to have different things to
[SPEAKER_01]: arrange in this kind of a market setting
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you mentioned earlier that,
you know, you were smoking on some GUI
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to quickly ask you, do you prefer
the flower or the concentrates you get
[SPEAKER_00]: from her?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a, and I get shit for this all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke a lot of concentrates for a
couple of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I'm 63 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lungs are like little raisins,
you know, right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't smoke a lot of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to kill it and make it even
a, like a little, I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: crazen, you know, it's going to be awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having said that, my, I, I can't get
used to smoking concentrates because then
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't evaluate what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything I do, I smoke, everything I
do, every plant you see, I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because I need to know what it's
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've saved it in case I went, Whoa,
you know, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I need to explore this more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and if it does that to me,
then I know it's something that is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be, something you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it does it to me with the amount I
smoke and what I do, if it does it to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's something that you folks want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I don't go to
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I, I'll smoke them
occasionally when they're given to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as a gratuity or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did a couple of days ago to the
cannabis cup winner from 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: He invited me over and then, and he just
wants to get me into smoking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's because it has a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a real reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't, if I did the other way,
cause he tells me he doesn't, he doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke flowers anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a professional and he doesn't smoke
flowers anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that's a flaw because you know,
the concentrates are going to be good if
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do you need to, you know,
if you need to smoke that then stop
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking for a while and get back to square
one and then start, you know, getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: more different stuff that, you know,
you're not doing as much damage to your
[SPEAKER_01]: lungs as far as the, the, the tars and
waxes that are in those concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're, they, they,
you know, believe me, I've been doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time and I've smoked a lot of
different stuff and it doesn't do your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your body a lot of good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got, I mean, it does,
it's good for your body in certain ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: not this way, but it's for a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, look, I wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made the switch to vaporizing only
over a year ago now, and I've never looked
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate flowers in such a more unique
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why I brought up
that question about the concentrates with
[SPEAKER_00]: the mom is because I, I enjoyed that post
on your Instagram about that, the machine
[SPEAKER_00]: you were looking for the hash oil machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you managed to find it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: God bless people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you, God bless people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I don't want to, you know,
name names and stuff on here because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people that just jump
through hoops and to get me machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm just so grateful because it's
such a unique little goofy thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: today's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really impractical and not really
a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still going to use it because it's
what I grew up with and like I was telling
[SPEAKER_01]: a gentleman yesterday about when he asked
me about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, you know, I had one of those
back when they first came out in high
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they were like a hundred and
seventy nine dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ordered one and it came all brown
wrap paper wrapped in just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just just the screen is all get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made some really fun raw hash oils
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't refine it and make
honey oils or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just raw hash oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was using old, you know,
little flowers and a lot of stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: people were using it at that time with
just leaves and and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, I'm going to throw in a
bunch of the other stuff and I throw hash
[SPEAKER_01]: in there that I'd make and everything and
get it all in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I take tie sticks just like
these, you know, and I'd make sticks and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'd roll it in there and let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd give them away as Christmas
presents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every fall, that was my little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was it was a every time I see
one of those or I think about it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall, I think, oh, I wish I had one of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bam, people have come through and I am
just overjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are going to be paid back very
handsomely for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I'm glad to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason I ask that is
because the connoisseur hash scene has
[SPEAKER_00]: really seen a resurgence in the past few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'm wondering for any of our
avid hash making listeners out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there any lines of yours particularly
that you think would do well making some
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally pick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are if they're looking for
things that are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh, you know, that's that's such a
hard question because I can sit here and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can think about several of them that just
stand out as far as the resin quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything is so close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the differences are nuanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's intentional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I build in this heavy resin stuff to
everything I do because that's how I like
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that in order to be able to have
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turps overwhelm me and have the high
be as pronounced in me as I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of the GUI based stuff is
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes, you know, like the pure GUIs and
anything with mom in the front tends to be
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those resin heads on her, I designed
so that they were larger because I kept
[SPEAKER_01]: choosing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every every breeder really does need to
just always have their loop with them so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can check everything and do
measurements, do size tests, test things,
[SPEAKER_01]: use microscopes, use loops and get in
there and just be picky as hell in picking
[SPEAKER_01]: out what it is that you think is just a
little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you can measure it micron wise,
do it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's how I got things to be
about two and a half times as large as
[SPEAKER_01]: they started out in the in the other
lander stuff that I use to make GUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kept selecting for the larger heads
because it kept they kept growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept seeing that this was a little
more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, at the same time, I had got lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same time those heads were getting
larger, the stocks were getting longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everybody knows that the THC is
located on the skin of all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that inside there is no THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all other oils and and things,
but the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my mind, increase the size of that
bubble and you've increased the potency
[SPEAKER_01]: range, which is how it works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the kind of things that I
think about when I'm doing this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have the cyclones,
those are very good for hash production
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're really coarse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that I liked this last year was
the King's Banner Cross because it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: upped the game a little bit with the
King's Banner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Bruce Banner thing and it was a
request done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people wanted that particular
strength with a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did that for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whatever I had left, I went ahead
and I just was giving out mostly to people
[SPEAKER_01]: for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I did sell some of my thinker or
Matt may have sold the majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, these little packages,
I mean, they can they hold a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really want I think that you'll be
able to see when you start growing that
[SPEAKER_01]: just about anything I do is made for
extraction and for high people who want,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that bold flavor forward kind of
an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I recommend anything with mom
gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend anything with midnight snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those are going to just just be really
well pronounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cyclones are going to be real
pronounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hawaiians, you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's I just like resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a resin guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to see it if it
doesn't produce like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's reassuring to hear and interesting
to hear about the King's Banner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to that in a few
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to ask you because you just
gave me the perfect introduction there
[SPEAKER_00]: where you said, you know, like things with
the gooey at the front tend to be good
[SPEAKER_00]: with the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some friends of mine and I were really
lucky enough to be able to try a midnight
[SPEAKER_00]: snow C99 gooey hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave us a beautiful, beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the all the things you could want
out of a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me thinking, how did that male
you selected out of the C99 gooey?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that like what traits does it pass
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you said, the gooey is very
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, a C99 probably pretty
dominant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did how did you find that one worked
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't produce the mom times C99 portion
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was done by Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Duke Diamond did those and sent me God
knows how many seed of five, six thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me to just to, you know,
to have to play around because he had used
[SPEAKER_01]: mom to make this cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went through some of those things
and I generally only give those away as
[SPEAKER_01]: freebies because it's not something that I
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can't make money off of somebody
else's hard work, but I can certainly pass
[SPEAKER_01]: on that work to other people for them to
experience his work and be able to enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found adding I did a couple of
crosses with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was a mom times mom times
C99.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, quite frankly, opened up the
recesses in the C99.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got quite a bit of interesting stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, mom didn't dominate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the C99, I I got to be honest with
you, it probably wouldn't have been my
[SPEAKER_01]: selection of breeding for for something to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never really found that special C99
that I've heard so much about over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, I haven't really looked
that hard for any other breeders work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not I've got too much else of my
own to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I we all we all stand on the shoulders
of those that came before us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came from all those hardworking people
that work before us to create what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is only incumbent upon us to do the
best we can going forward with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing that and being conscious always of
that, that you're not you're not to do all
[SPEAKER_01]: end all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I embrace as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you stay so humble?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a tool of God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask anybody who knows me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tell you I'm a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to have this experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to be able to help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to be his guiding work in
this so that others can go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it's for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And C99 is I think there's some stuff that
people really like in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And God bless them for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that he's an incredible guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank him very much for the
opportunity to be able to give other
[SPEAKER_01]: people his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting to hear,
you know, because we got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about the Kings banner and why
you chose to use that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a little bit of a more
fleshed out timeline of was it simply just
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had some friends requested or was
there a little more that went into picking
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there was some actually some
professional people that wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was something I was commissioned
to do with the understanding that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to give some of them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a difference because it's part of
the BPS, Black Platinum Society set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people aren't aware of all that
because it's an invite only for breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world that pay for genetics to
use in their own as their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually they're very trait specific
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kings banner was chosen because it has
a few of the receptors of some very old
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica's in there that this company wanted
to go ahead and have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they commissioned me to go ahead
and tie mom into that because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mom's got some excellent,
you know, you're getting five different
[SPEAKER_01]: Landris things in basically Landris,
not Hawaiian, but everything else is all
[SPEAKER_01]: raw genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of recesses that when
you pair them with other stuff that's old
[SPEAKER_01]: and way back that was created,
you're going to find some recesses that
[SPEAKER_01]: match up and bring out completely new
stuff like I'd mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was their thinking in this
that they wanted to have that spread and
[SPEAKER_01]: that set of stuff because, you know,
they could deconstruct it very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's methods to tear anything
apart and get back to the individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just if you want to take the time to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm past that myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I let others deal with that and they're
one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can go ahead and they can
deconstruct that into the two separates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can even take it further and
separate gooey all the way back into each
[SPEAKER_01]: individual component.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's all numbers, all numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like in terms of future projects,
do you have any current plans to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: bring another sort of external genetic
into the library and incorporate that or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Syrian was was one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some old Lebanese that I have
recently been gifted that I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to that come from the red regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I'm really hoping for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will know them because I've dealt with
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I lived in England, I saw a lot of
material from the Middle East in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that I have some experience in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know what to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have I'm also really excited about
the Colombian thing, because while the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada exotics genetics are very popular
now becoming now in Colombia, I've also
[SPEAKER_01]: discussed with some folks down there who
are actively going into the hills and
[SPEAKER_01]: going into the to find small growers
breeders that have been using these stocks
[SPEAKER_01]: in their families for generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the gentleman that's over there
and doing this for me has assured me that
[SPEAKER_01]: he's looking at some very unique things
that are have been growing for over there
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time, the old puna rotas,
these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very excited to look into those
because pairing those with gooey and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to bring out those old
Colombians and the Mexican the Acapulco
[SPEAKER_01]: gold that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to bring those forward a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are really fun genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really fun genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that sounds that sounds very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got me thinking on our most recent
episode, we had Todd McCormick come on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if you're familiar with
his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been in the scene for quite a while
doing things here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently, he's paired up with Mel
Frank and a few other people to bring some
[SPEAKER_00]: really old school gems back to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one I wanted to ask you about
specifically was he's got what he
[SPEAKER_00]: considers to be an original haze from Sam
the skunk man, as well as most especially
[SPEAKER_00]: original skunk one from Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought to myself, would you be
interested in doing a pure gooey project
[SPEAKER_00]: using that skunk one if you could get
access to it and were confident it was
[SPEAKER_00]: real?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I probably would because I used the
skunk one before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the skunk one that I used was from the
old SSSC back when it first was it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that started that's that was the
genetics that I used to cube gooey
[SPEAKER_01]: originally, because it has some of the
same genetics in it that gooey does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good matchup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really easy to work as far as
that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the original was very,
very malleable compared to later versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't even recognize the skunk
one now that that exists now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even recognize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have any of the
characteristics that I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk one was a very, very well crafted
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, we might have to get you two
in contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow up, he's also been able to
get original seeds of Northern Lights from
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle Greg, who's the guy who gave it to
Neville back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me wondering, would something
like Northern Lights ever interest you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's just too indica to help?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want to offer that to to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different because other people are
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that other people can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stay as original as possible
because that helps the public be more
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more that I sit there and do
exactly what I'm railing against by using
[SPEAKER_01]: other people's stuff is the hypocrisy
would grow and grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm into diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And making sure that we've got a selection
of things that just you can't get any
[SPEAKER_01]: other way than other than keeping them
separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I do a lot of interbreeding and
stuff, but I always have a purpose for
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm and this is my flaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see nothing but holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see nothing but holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when and to me, a hole needs to be
filled and it needs to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to take care of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll use the black raptor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were just freaking out over the
black raptor plant, how pretty it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I saw was is that it had buds that
were this long on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a bunch of stock and
nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a dirty plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, you know, that may work in
indoor grows and where they trim off the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms to promote the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A production grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be good for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my mind, it's a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my problem has always been and
always will be that all I do is see holes
[SPEAKER_01]: in other people's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an awful thing to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an awful thing to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an awful thing to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just can't smoke something and go,
wow, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go, hmm, you know, it's kind of
acidic and a little harsh on the throat
[SPEAKER_01]: and doesn't the buzz comes on really slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I analyze it to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the bad things about
being at the level of the type of breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: that I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just see nothing but holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, you guys all benefit from
that, I hope, because I filled the holes
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you get the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it's just a series of misses
and strikes and foul.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're lucky to have you and your unique
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, somebody's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't enjoy it, this is what
I've done all my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have to understand I was 13 when I
started growing my own plants because I
[SPEAKER_01]: moved around all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an Air Force brat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always had to have a stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I going to have a stash?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way you can do is to grow your
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what started all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that high times ad that had the
first Colombian gold in it because they
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't sell the damn stuff in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a hold of some of that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lit the fuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lit the fuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the very first time that I ever had
only two plants, it was in Texas,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might have been Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two plants, little plants,
and one of them died.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that left was a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grew seedless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought I'd invented something I
started going, what the hell is going?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the best pot I ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started reading about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, the Chinese for 5,000 years have
been doing it like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not anything special at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next year after that,
it was like super popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in California, they were making whole
houses full of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, yeah, all this amazing
seedless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I lived through all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a weird life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, that's the kind of
perspective that I have to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: everything through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, a brilliant perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to jump into some of the more
technical breeding questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just got one last quick one for you
that was submitted by quite a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to know, have you ever
been impressed by one of the more modern
[SPEAKER_00]: hype strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, what was the last thing to
impress you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that comes to mind is
something that came out of Humboldt in
[SPEAKER_01]: about 87, 88 that really took me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I was in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a friend of mine and I smoked a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started to drive away and realized I
forgot how to drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was some Afghani based material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the last time that I was
taken aback by something in many a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been many a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, again, I only see holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I smoke the commercial stuff,
it's like, you know, a lot of it is high
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, no soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, that's very well put.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's exactly how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it bottle rocket pot, where you're
projected up and you're high as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden, and it's gone
and just away with the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, the genetics are to me
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see, again, I'm colored by so much
use and so many different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be, you know, it just has to be
something very unique that's going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: my body by surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's just another thing that,
you know, I've had a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, I got to say,
I probably know I haven't smoked very much
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm really impressed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm sad to say that because I know
that sounds really horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not that kind of person to want to
come off like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a sneaking suspicion you weren't
going to tell me you were impressed by
[SPEAKER_00]: runts, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it brings us to sort of how you go
about creating strains yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first question I wanted to ask
you is you were talking a little earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, these flavors that emerge
from your new lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly can agree with that,
having tried a few different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my first question is, do you create
lines with the intention of sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: filling a flavor profile you don't have?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not I'm not hitting anything,
any plan with anything without a goal
[SPEAKER_01]: firmly in mind for that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know exactly what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know what I want to bring forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know how I'm going to bring it
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know what I need to do in order to
get that done the most efficient ways
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and this all goes back to knowing
your strains inside and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will look at my stuff and they'll
say, well, you've got this combination
[SPEAKER_01]: over here and this combination over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can get one or the other and be all
right and be in the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a completely different
thing from this than you were over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though they're using the same
genetics and different combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: The target was different for this batch
than it was for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's a lot of unique flavors from
the old African strain that I use for the
[SPEAKER_01]: purples that that really come through and
levels of spices and different kinds of of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stay away from the earthy
flavors because those are predominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody complains about your comments on
earthiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Moroccan spice bizarre kind of
a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I only select for that kind of an
effect from those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you're going to get out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tasted something like that
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm after is that effect right
there because more and more pots becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: less about being stoned and being super
high than it is about the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption experience in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to translate,
whether it be oils, whether it be resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be flour, whether it be hash,
it's all going to translate over in that
[SPEAKER_01]: way, in that form for you to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the set that I want to be
different from everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm designing something,
it's always with a whole kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole I'm trying to get filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these look like little tiny
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't mean shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this particular batch doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, they show me in all these
different sections, they show me what this
[SPEAKER_01]: spread had and how many were good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to look at this real
closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can look, look at this expression
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at this expression here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're off the same damn seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you grow and you only get this
expression, what are you going to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to look any further in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But microbreeding shows you these
different levels of color, different
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of resin, and more importantly,
the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one has their own unique smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are like the others,
and some are very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're targeting whichever trade it is
that you're looking for in that spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: of what you're trying to design for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you choose that and you neglect
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't look back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people fall for this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, this is pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to maybe use that for something
else, unless it's super exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got a target for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the mentality that I live by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to bring that up because the
microbreeding thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is microbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what microbreeding in this company is
growing a lot of seeds, picking them out
[SPEAKER_01]: after only letting them get so big so that
you can have fast turnover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expression doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it does is demonstrate what's in that
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you choose that and you take it
to the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I never wrote the book,
because it's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to take it to the next step
to see whether it's a viable plant for the
[SPEAKER_01]: other purposes, like production,
like how it does as far as a big plant
[SPEAKER_01]: goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've eliminated a lot of trouble and
a lot of unusable material, a lot of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: money, and space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've eliminated all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've only focused on what is proper
and right and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've had it in record amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I can do things so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say, honey, how can you do this
stuff so fast?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think that I'm one of these
people that doesn't test my lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I test my lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see what I'm going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the numbers of the different how
much male and female I'm going to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I want to get to in a second because
breeders can drive male and female
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to use an example from an
unlikely source, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something I experienced back
when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Nebraska, they grow a lot of corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of wild hemp everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matter of fact, I used to hollow out the
wild hemp fields that were close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would plant Colombian seed and then
go in there and that was how I never had
[SPEAKER_01]: to worry about growing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, I would just seed with
everything and males and females and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least nobody was stealing your
stuff and they were leaving it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked basically the same because
it was Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that was noticed by
farmers in the area, and I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation with one of them once that
eluded me to notice this, is that there
[SPEAKER_01]: was an increase in females adjacent to the
corn crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one deciding factor that I could
see that was different besides it being
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff, which is another factor,
was nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it turned out to be, and nature
kind of does this as a survival kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can understand this because it makes
perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a nitrogen, pre-flower, nitrogen-rich
or nitrogen-enhanced, shall we say,
[SPEAKER_01]: setting, nature is going to prefer females
because the plants get larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be more of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's less need for males to be as
proliferous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nature, over time, and with the
conditions being that way, in a landress
[SPEAKER_01]: setting, you will see this effect happen
where they have an increase in female
[SPEAKER_01]: populations by introducing a little bit of
nitrogen, pre-flower, more than is
[SPEAKER_01]: normally in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just upping that a little bit,
over time, now it's different with
[SPEAKER_01]: polyhybrids, but we'll get to that in a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking right now about landresses
because landresses show that variation in
[SPEAKER_01]: environment much more readily and
predictably as demonstrated by the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: than the other polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polyhybrids, you got to know what's in it
and know what's being expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you get fooled and most people
don't have that knowledge or they don't go
[SPEAKER_01]: to that depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're speaking with landers,
it's easy to see this effect take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always like to tell breeders that
maybe you can, over a period of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're breeding these stocks again
and again and again, you can up that
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of females expressed for your
customers because most of the people
[SPEAKER_01]: buying seed are looking for females.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the best for your customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's what we're working for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I tend to go for a 50-50 shot with
mine because breeders are my main people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like to tell breeders, go ahead and
just make these small adjustments like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so learning that just firsthand,
it was really kind of interesting to see
[SPEAKER_01]: that effect in a raw nature state and then
to kind of figure it out and have it
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are always going to do what is best
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about music.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say, oh, they respond to music.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't respond to music.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't respond to vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: They respond to whatever is best for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done studies that,
back in the 70s, they thought that plants
[SPEAKER_01]: were responding better to rock music than
they did to anything else and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsequent studies have just proven all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double-blind tests of this, it doesn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping that in mind when you're
growing this stuff is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever is the best for the plant is what
the plant is going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is going to affect its
expression, because microclimates make all
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use GUI as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown GUI for so long, and I've grown
her under so many different methods and
[SPEAKER_01]: styles of growing indoor, outdoor,
deep-water culture, aeroponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything I have used over the course of
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enhanced soils, unenhanced soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything a single thing that you do
affects a different expression that's
[SPEAKER_01]: buried in that plant that is going to be
the best for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why people say dialing in the
plants is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go ahead and dial this stuff
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to do that is to try
different things and see the reaction and
[SPEAKER_01]: get that stuff going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'll tell you right now,
there are some people out there that take
[SPEAKER_01]: my stuff, and they do amazing things with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could never do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could never do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're better at it than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're better at growing my pot than I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because they've learned how to
dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant sentiment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an interesting discussion point about
the male to female ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to hear your opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the more modern polyhybrid
strains, do you think there's much you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do to influence the sex ratios,
or it's pretty sad?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, you've got to know the
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know how these things are
built, and what ratios that they were used
[SPEAKER_01]: in, and whether they back-crossed any at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back-crossing has a tendency to reinforce
background recesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't bring them necessarily forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing that people think that
they're maybe bringing a recessive and
[SPEAKER_01]: making it dominant by back-crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily the case,
especially with polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just be shoving it back into the
mix further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the best way to bring about
something that is unique and different and
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful and everything is probably by
introducing an unfamiliar genetic that
[SPEAKER_01]: allows the recessives that it's made up
from to pair and become dominant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep going back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's really the crux of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luther Burbank taught us all these basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what I live by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the same county that Luther
Burbank used to live in and did his work
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is the sweet spot in the
global world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the one place that he called the
best place on earth for growing as many
[SPEAKER_01]: different things as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all that mentality comes back to
that kind of thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I base everything on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, one of the things I remember very
vividly from our last discussion is your
[SPEAKER_00]: fondness for Luther Burbank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good to see it still alive and
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the lessons that he teaches are
simple, but they're direct and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: fully applicable to any single first-time
grower on up to the seasoned professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only other way that you could
change things now, and we can get into
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you want, is gene splicing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing some amazing things with
that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're inserting Tert profiles that
just never existed in nature before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even right down to some of my own
silly little work with silver to do female
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which by the way, I want to give a little
tip to people who are trying to make their
[SPEAKER_01]: own plow silver for making females is use
just one battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use three batteries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is, is because you want
those particles to be as small as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more current you've got flowing,
the larger those particles are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're taking up a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take your time and let it go,
say overnight rather than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a few hours with a bunch of batteries,
I've found much better effect in material
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't like to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like mom does not like to change sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with the silver, it's very hard to
get her to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it much more readily with a smaller
molecule than a larger one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I use those kinds of things in my own
work only to highlight certain traits in a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain particular project per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that I normally do,
but I will do it in this instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want everybody to be aware in states
like, let's use California as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say I used a mom and old Mendo Hayes
female that I went ahead and forced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got female seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't enter that into the plant realm
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's considered a GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the state is against GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that to a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if everything, and this is
something that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if everything after that,
that you go and convert back to normal,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, regular genetics, whether that's
all considered GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, it seemed like it would
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're producing product to go into the
system, be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you've got smarter people than
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dealing with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, I'd love to talk about that a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the past, we've had some guests
on who have spoken notably about one
[SPEAKER_00]: company called Molecular Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won the Emerald Cup in, I believe,
2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what's interesting about their
win is that they've got a few well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: people working for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's never been confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what people hypothesize is that these
guys have used maybe CRISPR or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that to do what you said and to
create a very specific terp profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason people think this is
because it was the first sample ever
[SPEAKER_00]: tested worldwide that had zero Mersene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just thought Mersene is one of
the base terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just sort of thought it has to be
in everything to an extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that, that if it's
not there, they probably did do something
[SPEAKER_00]: on the molecular level or not necessarily?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, nature's pretty freaky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can come up with some really
interesting phenotypes that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see something naturally skipping a
component, whether they did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's really no way for me to
tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't sit here and say,
oh, sure, they did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way that could happen,
because no, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the same token, yeah, it does seem
a little suspicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, they should just be
quizzed on their methodology and finding
[SPEAKER_01]: out, you know, how it is that they
specifically did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a trade secret, that only muddies
the waters more, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly the opposite of what I'm
doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you right now, if you take
like, you know, some of the hybrids that I
[SPEAKER_01]: made and you put them up against something
that's been designed turp-wise,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bet you they're damn close just from
selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bet you they're damn close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think you can do the
lessons for that is I think you can do it
[SPEAKER_01]: the natural right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to invest the time effort
and be as picky as all hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's the other like sort
of alternative theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the follow up question to that is
let's say that they had made some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically modified line like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On face value, you might sort of think,
well, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: But people have raised their concerns that
what if there was the potential for this
[SPEAKER_00]: to sort of be like the strain hunters
thing where like this plant pollinates
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants and then all of a sudden
plants are losing their ability to express
[SPEAKER_00]: mercy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's a reasonable fear or
it's maybe a bit far-fetched?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anybody done any tests on these plants
to see if that's a trait that gets passed
[SPEAKER_01]: on or if that's genetically only set in
the seed that's developed on the F1?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if that's, you know,
again, you don't know their methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the missing link to that whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of these questions could be
answered without knowing first what their
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they stick to straight selection,
then, you know, and if that's true,
[SPEAKER_01]: then yeah, it's possible, you know,
it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can have plants that are
completely devoid of chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in nature, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, chlorophyll is a natural component
that's always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you look at stuff like the
old colchizine treatments and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we talked about that last time
where, you know, you're stopping the
[SPEAKER_01]: division at the point of mitosis and you
have double sets of chromosomes and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all of that stuff nature takes
care of and it will fix that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So subsequent breedings and stuff will
tell the tale as to whether those
[SPEAKER_01]: components have been set as a trait
expression or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guess is, is that if it's been
manipulated naturally without intervention
[SPEAKER_01]: further, it's going to come back into
normal because the plant will fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These genetics are a lot older than we
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to quickly loop back to the
microbreeding for two seconds because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got two questions that I think will help
the listeners a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is when you do your little,
you know, your test selection that you
[SPEAKER_00]: just showed us shortly ago, are you
initiating flower from seed, like just
[SPEAKER_00]: going straight into 12-12?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, generally I'm letting them get a
little bit bigger only because there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: period that I believe, and I don't know if
this is fact or not, but it seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the case with many of the things I've made
over the years, is that plants really need
[SPEAKER_01]: to be about two months old in order to be
able to fully express everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones that, like the ones I showed
you there, they were just put into the
[SPEAKER_01]: grouping and they had about a week's worth
of growth and then they went into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just natural flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it's done in a more
controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little tests like this are really
more just to see what's there and not to,
[SPEAKER_01]: for real work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that one was just a very super small
example of what it would normally be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally there'd be large trays all under
artificial lights that can be controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: with soil only and cow shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to use any chemicals and I'll
tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes the expression and I can't tell
what the plants genetically is doing if
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm changing its expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes back to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment affects everything you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm looking for trade expression,
I want to be as basic as possible and
[SPEAKER_01]: generic as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything gets the same light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything gets the same water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything gets the same soil and air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, show me what you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I use and how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I urge breeders when they're,
if they're doing breeding and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing testing, use pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to use pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put them in the soil because
there's too much variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put it in hydroponics because
then all of a sudden you're manipulating
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment beyond what it's naturally
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not witnessing uptake correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not metabolizing correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things are changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in pots with soil and cow shit tell you
everything you need to know for a test of
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really urge breeders to do that for
a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, you know, pots, you can go ahead and
move.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a, let's say a rain event
outside and you're right in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: throes of it, you can move the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're in the ground, you can't move
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only cover them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Covering them changes things, you know,
it creates molds and possible powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew and it invites, you know,
more things to live underneath it and be
[SPEAKER_01]: protected with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's all of that stuff is
affected by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put them in pots and you put
them, everything gets the same treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have to go inside because of a
weather event, they all go in together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything's experiencing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get the truest
expression and know exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naturally, that you can do your work from
from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you find something that excites
you and passes the tests, do you try to
[SPEAKER_00]: revege it or you just pop more seeds and
start from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I revege that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't need to pop more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already, I've already done that and I've
already seen a spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already made the selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to see what that plant is going
to do in the next phase, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: production, you know, full size plant,
what its structure is like, how it
[SPEAKER_01]: responds to different stimuli.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't I'll take I'll revege that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll grow a number of the same plants and
then they go under different sets of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing methods so that I can see which
one is optimum and what they do under each
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I can speak to you intelligently.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you ask me a question about X doing
this with this, what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what's going to happen under that
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can speak intelligently about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not doing that as a breeder,
you're disservicing your clientele.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people on the seed buying end need to
demand more of their breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to demand more accountability
because there's too many genetics out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that are trash genetics that show
hermes in the second and third
[SPEAKER_01]: generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just bomb or they pass on
horrible traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can sit here and list shit all
day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's up to you as a breeder to
correct and do deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones and everybody says,
oh, well, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how many look at your competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how many people you're dealing
with out there now as seed breeders that
[SPEAKER_01]: think about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been all of my life dealing with an
increasingly growing number of people
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into this business that I love so
much and muddying the waters so
[SPEAKER_01]: thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seeing it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're making money hand over fist
while I'm sitting there trying to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it comes back to bite up in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how many times there's
been great seed companies that are gone
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: See ya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how long I've been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a reason is I'm a picky
bastard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why that's why I'm still here
because I'm a picky bastard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an old crotchety fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to think I know what I've
experienced in life is the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, you got my backing just as a quick
follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reveging is still a conversation and a
subject area, which is surprisingly sparse
[SPEAKER_00]: with information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear, do you have any tips
or tricks for our listeners about how you
[SPEAKER_00]: read?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, re-vegging is simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Re-vegging is absolutely simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem that people do with re-vegging
is they don't leave enough material on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't leave enough material.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a special plant, is that little
bitty bud that's down there on the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: worth anything to you as far as in a bowl
where it's going to be gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it going to be worth it to you to
re-veg it and have the plant spring from
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I will post some, I have some
pictures of a few things that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: re-vegged throughout the year that I can
show what the effect is with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will post those up on Instagram to
show people how stuff looks when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I do is I normally reap,
I dig up the plant if it's in the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I have a ground plant and I want to
keep it, I dig it up and I give it some B1
[SPEAKER_01]: and I put new soil around it and I water
the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I leave enough green on there for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I move it inside under 20 hours
minimum of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like to use high intensity
discharge lights for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use cool white fluorescent
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 70% blue, 30% red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it produces, you've already got a root
system, so it doesn't need the red so
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs the blue to be able to leaf out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those will happen much faster because
they don't produce as much heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have the plants close to it and
just go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put it under 20 hours of light
minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get to that in a second because
like GUI is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: GUI was under 24 hours of light for
decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any time now you drop GUI,
anything below without working it and
[SPEAKER_01]: really being very careful and letting it
go down in increments that are very small,
[SPEAKER_01]: she'll just flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, because she's 38 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it time to flower now?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what she's thinking all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always tell people that because when
you're re-vegging and you're using it for
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 or 20 hour, at some point you want to
work it back to a normal light cycle that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can then move a plant outside if you
want to without it going off and flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some stuff to think about when
you're doing re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the fastest way to re-veg a
plant is just to do exactly what I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little B1, a little nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to give it a little nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use ammonia nitrate and just go
ahead and I just water a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: that in because everything else is in the
fresh soil that it's going to need for
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to promote that leaf growth
and get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will post up pictures of that that
show just how easy that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any stage, I have saved gooey once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had harvested plants and not realized
that I didn't have any gooey mom left and
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took a bud and I cut it and I put it
in under the 24 hour light in a glass of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept changing the water and doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I regenerated that bud and got gooey
mom back after almost losing her one year
[SPEAKER_01]: early, way early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do anything with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes diligence and vigilance and
a little bit of love and caring and just
[SPEAKER_01]: giving the plant what it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the plant wants to live,
trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't want to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to try and do everything it
can to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you just got to do is make that
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an incredible story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to ask, gooey might be the oldest
clone in terms of its actual age that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all those years, people sometimes talk
about plants deteriorating over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that you can live long
enough to experience degradation and
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics from environmental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have always seen and what I do
believe happens is microclimate affecting
[SPEAKER_01]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are noticing those differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil may be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air may be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more moist or less moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just got too moist of an
environment, resin is suppressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the plant doesn't want to mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to try and increase airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of everything in terms of what the
plant is trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant is always trying to
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wants to make as many of the little
babies as it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything goes back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are of the common belief that
radiation is what degrades genetics over a
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That and the ends of the chromosomes,
of course, becoming small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you take a cutting of a plant,
it's as old as that plant is in what the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant knows its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always tell people like Gooey,
Gooey just thinks it's been one long day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can take Gooey and I can grow her
in any of these different scenarios and
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce exactly what I got all those
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the right environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have always said my favorite Gooey
is rock wool slabs, general hydroponics
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients under a metal halide light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the favorite flavor and favorite
expression that I like of the mom Gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other expressions come out and they
may be deemed as genetic degradations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're not optimum for what that
target is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what people are
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'd have to live several hundred
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are tomatoes, let's say,
back from Roman times that are still 140
[SPEAKER_01]: year old tomato plants that have been kept
alive and have been doing for a very long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Roman times, but they come from Roman
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roman apples, as they were called.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't degraded and those stocks are
140 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this notion, I think a lot of times it
can be something that explains poor
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and masks poor breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It masks poor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It masks changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different things are what people
are, I believe, truly experiencing and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not experiencing genetic
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you spoke about making some
babies in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to loop back for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually mentioned you were making
some feminized seeds and you got me
[SPEAKER_00]: curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it that stimulated you to look
into this a bit more than you had in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's only my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strictly really for my own use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give whatever I have left over
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I did notice is
that I think I introduced a plant that I
[SPEAKER_01]: hadn't rinsed fully and kept segregated
enough before it shed some other pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: that was actually the father of the black
raptor got into that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would never, ever sell those
seeds as a result, because you may get a
[SPEAKER_01]: purple male out of there that,
you know, or a purple female that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: belong in that set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, the reason I made that is
basically to target certain traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: which worked out wonderfully, that I can
do some specific work with mom,
[SPEAKER_01]: dark desire and old Mendo haze for some
refinement portions of some very targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of the traits that I want to see
for those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to go back and turn
them back into regular seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those I will make available to folks
to use, but they will have very much
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighted traits that the people really
kind of concentrate on when they
[SPEAKER_01]: experience them the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to bring those out even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a cheat sheet fast way of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetically doing that is it's a cheater's
way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't color any genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, it's just a fast cheating way
of eliminating half the gene pool so that
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, my internet connection is unstable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I wonder what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could still hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in asking you,
you obviously mentioned how you make your
[SPEAKER_00]: own colloidal silver solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever trialed STS or any
preferences, or it's just what you chosen
[SPEAKER_00]: at work?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just because I could do it myself
and I didn't have to deal with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it was just the quickest way that
I can, again, I'm a control freak as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to be in control of all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the easiest, fastest one
to use to come up with the, and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically shift anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have said that it genetically
shifts things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what they're seeing is
recessive that are being made dominant by
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing the gene sets that are
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the plant and a recessive and a
recessive or are mixing in to become a
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those dominance is from
aphrodism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think that that's what
they're seeing is expressions of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're saying that it's changing the
genetics when no, it's not changing the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics because the silvers are just
hormonal manipulators is all they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're overwhelming the system,
the female system and fooling it with a
[SPEAKER_01]: male component so that it just grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's, that's a simple,
just a science thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, yeah, that's the
reason I use it is just because I can
[SPEAKER_01]: control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can totally understand that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just out of curiosity, when I was
doing some research for our discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: today, I was reading various forum posts
and seems like people still just
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely dying to try the NorCal GUI
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering, do you think an S1 would be
too recessively dominant?
[SPEAKER_00]: To give them that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that something they might be able to
get in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just with the tests and stuff,
I still find that it fragments and it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: off into the end, more into the
individuals than one would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, it's not as collective of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the reason why I went with
the S1 for the cubing pure GUI and going
[SPEAKER_01]: back to it because I can control that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, and keep the mix from,
from breaking apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all just back to selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm working on another set
of pure GUI in a different fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some aspects of it that I used to
really love about the individuals,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially the Vietnamese and the Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to bring those forward more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been kind of working with that
mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have known this, I've been kind
of leaning towards a much more Far East
[SPEAKER_01]: expression than I've gotten in pure GUIs
from the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they tend to, you know,
carry on some of that S1 in their flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bad by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not what I'm tuned into getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm now working on a different pure GUI
that might take a little longer to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce, but I think it's going to get a
better result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in the midst of a huge project
here in Northern California with a large
[SPEAKER_01]: legal grow operation that's coming into
being.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the aspects that that's going
to be is to be able to open up the exotic
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exotic cuts has been something that
I've been telling people about for years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've been stalled because of
permitting and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people will actually be able to get
Mom and Old Mendo He's and Dark Desire and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the stuff that I've been working on
and that were are the classics of my
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be able to get those plants when
that opens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actively, we're just waiting on
the counties to do their thing and get us
[SPEAKER_01]: open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have a tendency to believe that
what I want to do is offer those genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: to both home growers and to professionals
to be able to use in their arsenals of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that everybody's going to be able
to have a chance to experience by that
[SPEAKER_01]: time, maybe a 40 year old plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did the math and I was like,
I think sometime next late next year might
[SPEAKER_00]: be the 40 year mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right around this time right now,
it was 38 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's about two more years to go,
I would say, before it gets to 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been an amazing journey with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love it because it's so versatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that I would say that I
don't like about it is it's so thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so heavy producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the leaves kind of tend to be easy to
exaggerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feed just a little bit too much
nitrogen, you'll get a lot of heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavier than normal leaf growth in in some
of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything, everything I've seen 13
foot tall plants that have colas this big
[SPEAKER_01]: on top and they're as big as your leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then five on the bottom, just huge
buds, just huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's there's too much trimming to
deal with and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the kind of things that,
you know, the public would love to have
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's maybe not perfectly practical for
an industrial setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I kind of tend to think GUI
is going to be situated as a homegrown
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that I think people can just enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to probably going to
market it towards that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to where the home user and the small plant
grower, you know, maximizes their benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: by getting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's always gravy on the top to
have something that old and it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: around and you've heard about and seen and
and you've only wish you could try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I have to do it for free,
I want it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, you're a mind reader when you
brought up the exotic cuts program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you about that,
but you did it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the follow up I had for that is we see
recently breeders are commonly partnering
[SPEAKER_00]: up with bigger facilities to run larger
numbers or to run their select pheno at a
[SPEAKER_00]: big volume so the masses can really
experience like what you're describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my question is, if you had a
big facility come to you and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we want to grow something that's
unique, but it's still going to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal to the general masses, to sort of
the hype market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you think would fit
that bill pretty nicely?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have several that are are tuned in
just for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what these people that
I've teamed up with are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a full nursery size unit with with
ten thousand square foot grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking a very industrial size
outfit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to use my genetics because
they can have an inroad into the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and stuff with something that
isn't available any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff is showy and pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus, we're trying to in this county,
we're trying to get the tourism aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've seen my work with the Pinkle
Berry that's geared towards that aspect,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I want to have, you know,
fields that are showy and beautiful and
[SPEAKER_01]: photographic, ready for the masses to be
able to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't hurt that those plants are
also tasty, flavorful and strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the kind of the mindset that
we're going for, because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to benefit this community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want this community to to draw
attention like no other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of feel like we've got a
unique set to be able to do that and
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just one aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But boy, you know, designing those plants,
I have the exact thing in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to look at a field of those and see
nothing but dark purple plants with
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful effervescent fluorescent magenta
pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the water leaves all turn a
bright orange, yellow, bright orange,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll make it look like there's a
field of fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I'm fashioning these
lines to do is specifically that so they
[SPEAKER_01]: are photo ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I've already built in all the
other stuff, the flavor and all that other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a marketable product on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's always holes to fill,
and we can do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're continuing to go in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what all this is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A brilliant approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had noticed on your Instagram,
you'd been posting some photos over the
[SPEAKER_00]: past few months of a strain you're calling
American sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing which really caught me about
that one was that you say it's got like a
[SPEAKER_00]: vanilla profile to it, which is quite an
underrepresented sort of terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think it might get quite
popular?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm actually breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two females, one purple and one
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post them up on Instagram as to what
they look like at the moment, because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just finishing up for those runs
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the profiles of the vanilla tend to
fade away after week nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before week nine, you're getting this
distinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually said here, I think it was
Northstar who mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, What do you get off of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I already had vanilla in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, Oh, it smells vanilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly because I haven't heard of
a vanilla one before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't really come across anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the first thing that comes to
mind when I smell, especially the green
[SPEAKER_01]: one, the purple one is a little bit more
spicy in the back because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: components that it has from the colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can steer it back over and I will do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm working on now is to
get those into some very dependable
[SPEAKER_01]: vanilla flavors, because then you mix that
with a nice coffee variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a latte.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned I was curious to ask you
because you've got such experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of creating these new flavor
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that, you know, the late sub
cool rest in peace often described
[SPEAKER_00]: creating strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would say, if you got one that's
chocolate and one that's vanilla,
[SPEAKER_00]: combine them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a latte, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that you sort of agree with
that sort of mindset or do you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's the clock is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: A broken clock is right twice a day kind
of syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to tell sub that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that, you know, you can go ahead
and you can have these different
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you lock that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the purpose of going ahead and
reveging plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you've got to be able to lock that
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it's present and pronounced in
the phenotype that you're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've already got half of it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to make that a set a set
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using other genetics that use
create this to go ahead and reset that
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant interest and to keep it dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use the same things where that came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that means you got to know your
backgrounds of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes back to the same things that
are these basics that I tell people all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they they look for these complicated
methods and how they do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simple selection and being picky
period and the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do anything I want with a given set
of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has something that I want to make it
come forward and anybody else can do the
[SPEAKER_01]: same damn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to put the work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an interesting question submitted
by one of our listeners, and I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was sort of inspired by our first
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like they really took on
board the point you made about how you can
[SPEAKER_00]: take a certain trait you like from this
plant and improve it or bring it to
[SPEAKER_00]: another cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they were sort of wondering is,
let's just say I've got like four base
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and I like certain things about
each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to sort of ultimately lead it
into one end strain where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating the things I like about each
into one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it's practically
possible for someone to do that or
[SPEAKER_00]: logistically, it would just require a lot
of work?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to require a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're willing to do the work,
then you've got to have multiple plants of
[SPEAKER_01]: the same plant that you can use to work
with and do your R&D with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to just go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, and that's why I always tell
people, when you're beginning and when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not as sure about your genetic
stock, concentrate on one trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't concentrate on anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is again, what you're describing is
what I was telling you about, ooh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this little plant is prettier and you can
save this for another project.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's you getting in your own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always tell people it's better to
focus on one thing, get it locked in,
[SPEAKER_01]: lock down, then move to the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to work on four plants,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save copies of the other three,
work on the one, get it right,
[SPEAKER_01]: then move to the next one because you're
going to be a lot more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a lot more done and
you're going to do it in a lot shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: time than if you're trying to fuck around
with four plants, four different
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions, and you're trying to
stabilize each one of those expressions in
[SPEAKER_01]: a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I do it because I'm, you know,
I know my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backwards and forwards, as far as my
genetics that I'm working with,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't have that luxury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus they're working with a lot of poly
hybrids in this industry that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't know what they're made of.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can say it's made of something when
it's totally different or that's what they
[SPEAKER_01]: were told it was, you know, and it isn't
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's better to do the work yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always feel it's better to
concentrate on smaller chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when you're cleaning your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your house is totally fucked up and
totally needs cleaning and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmed looking at this whole house
not clean, stop, go over to this three
[SPEAKER_01]: foot little area and clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your task for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next day, the three foot next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you know it, your house is clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hadn't suffered any and it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfectly same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keeping it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one of our listeners submitted
questions was how many seeds do you like
[SPEAKER_00]: to pop of one of your own lines before you
feel satisfied?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a good idea of what's inside it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it's been a refined targeted
line, I can get away with a dozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll show me the, it'll show me
the spread of basically everything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might get these recessive eyeballs
here and there, but you know, they aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be something that expresses as
readily as those other 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're, they're going to,
it's going to show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, I tend to think that now if
you're doing R and D lines, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: six, 700 seeds, you know, I'm serious,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, people laugh and they say,
how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, when you're growing little
tiny plants, it's not as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a lot easier than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And half of those are going to go away as
males anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I don't chase males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never chase males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always advocate that people don't chase
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, males are a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The females are what you chase and the
females are what you refine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, everything is done to refine that
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't chase males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what sort of guiding principles do you
use when selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find the female that has the
qualities you want and then try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the male that matches up to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It all goes back to what it is that I'm
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I tried to color it,
okay, does that male show color?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dependently, is it going to pass it on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it come from a color line that has
color already built in or is the color
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive and only showing in that one
phenotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: It all goes back to targeted results as
far as what you want to do and how you
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's all you choosing and knowing
the background and using that background
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe you're currently working on
an old Mendo-Haze back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had me wondering what traits about
the old Mendo-Haze do you really like and
[SPEAKER_00]: which do you think could maybe be improved
a little?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I already did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cross fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Mendo-Haze has a hell of a stretch
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't like all that elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of kept the elongation because
it was easier to to fill the empty spaces
[SPEAKER_01]: than it was to stop the elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took the easy path in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get big plants, there's sativa
base, and there's a lot less stem,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot more fuller flowers,
larger flowers, the flower size is
[SPEAKER_01]: increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a marker that I use, which was
the dark desire as a color marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was tubing, that I was steering
away from that color marker, and then GUI
[SPEAKER_01]: is in there also because of the resin
expression, but she's in the back end with
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was used with pure GUI was used
for that, not mom GUI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the the male that I did that for
only to increase the resin size on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: which indeed it and I can again show
people on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had examples right here that I
could bring up because I have examples of
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff where I can show you the
difference between the old Mendo-Haze
[SPEAKER_01]: mother and the improved version and what
it does and how much better it is as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as a overall grower experience from that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still has the bright,
overwhelmingly bright flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 24% minimum THC is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those familiar flavors that I talk
about when I take the lime and the vodka,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are very pronounced and everything
is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a fuller plant that produces
better bud and bigger bud and has,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's more refined is
basically is all that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's the color marker in
there, just for my own work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, if someone were to cross it
with a recessive color, all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd get kids that are all kinds of
different colors and that'd be,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's always a fun surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not a, it's like a little
genetic time bomb, but it's a good one,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a bad one, like hermes, you know,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I ran one of Subcool's
breeding theories by you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd love to run one of DJ Short's
by you, which is he always spoke about he
[SPEAKER_00]: liked to have the more sativa of the two
plants in the cross being the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never really explained why that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever found anything like that or
got any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, I think it's more strain
specific in that instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, yeah, if you're dealing with
hybrids and stuff, I tend to lean towards
[SPEAKER_01]: the sativas myself only because one,
they're bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to be fuller, you know,
with a lot better production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just like the high better as far as
that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brighter, more pronounced kind of
high that fits my personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all very person specific stuff that
you're talking about there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody who else who tries that may go
and go for the indica side because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what they favor and their brain craves
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all comes back to me is to,
I want everybody to have the choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to be able to choose what's
best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I like to have a spread on
the things that I do for breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have that spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself choose the sativa sides more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know me, I'm a Thai, Vietnamese,
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm old school Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have fond memories of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just feel like they're more
efficient at giving me the type of high
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not into sedative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm into, you know, euphoric and
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the kind of highs I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be able to go to Hawaii,
smoke a nice sativa bowl, and then go out
[SPEAKER_01]: and enjoy the day, not sit there on the
beach and veg and bake in the sand and get
[SPEAKER_01]: a sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing which just came to mind
when you were talking about that is DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Short commented and it's very much a
personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Oh, yeah, I really like smoking
flour that's been seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's some sort of slight
changes in seeded bud versus sense seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you fall into that category?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not really?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like smoking the flowers to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, you know, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it because again,
what happens when it's making seed is the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant stops THC production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what THC is available there goes into
post THC products and you're getting a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of degraded THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably what he likes about it
is that that CBN kind of a feel that that
[SPEAKER_01]: settling that that heaviness that
sedativeness that it's great for pain kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can see that as being something
that would be present in seeded pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember plenty of seeded brick weed
from back in the day that was just thicker
[SPEAKER_01]: than shit far as a high goes, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all to me is just degraded
resin is what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you like that kind of high,
let your plants sit around.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's what they do in the hash making
regions of the world is in the especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in the poor regions, they'll just pile the
plants in the corner and let them sit for
[SPEAKER_01]: six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they make the hash out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hash is very sedated, very heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel it a lot in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all from sitting around and
just being exposed and oxidizing that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really kind of depends on what your
tastes are and where you're going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, degraded resin has never been my
I don't really care for it as much as I
[SPEAKER_01]: like the bright, newer resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always a new plant kind of a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's kind of my thing from
growing so much and having samples all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just gotten into that that rail of fresh
smoke all the time because it never ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's not a day that goes by
that there is something fresh and new that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried before that goes into my
lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I speak from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, if we're on the other end of
the spectrum of short flowering things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned at the start that you have a
number of lines that are quite quick and
[SPEAKER_00]: the gooey can be harvested reasonably
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my question is, do you think
there's such a thing as too short of a
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time in the sense that if I came
to you and said, hey, I got this line
[SPEAKER_00]: ready in 35 days, people say, oh,
yeah, but like the high probably won't
[SPEAKER_00]: last that long or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think you can get great high at
a very short flower time?
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can trim it down that much,
you bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little, that's a really short,
but you know, that's almost going off of
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowering kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some reservations myself,
but there's nothing that says that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't have full product in a short period
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that I can say in that it
conflicts with that is my two month rule
[SPEAKER_01]: for plants is that if you want to see a
full expression, you need two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I equate that as the same thing as a
prepubescent girl being able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: pregnant versus one that's gone into
puberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's just not ready yet, you know,
and she just is not able to conceive yet
[SPEAKER_01]: at that age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she goes and it gets old enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's mature and she can reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the genetics set up and are
able to establish themselves and express
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves more completely in a slightly
older plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got, and that's why when I
microbreed, if I'm going really fast and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking things really quick and they're
not maybe quite two months, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole purpose of having a secondary growth
set, you know, as a test, nothing is set
[SPEAKER_01]: in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I picked that plant the first time
it's just gone down to the next stage is
[SPEAKER_01]: all, you know, there's still a lot of
evaluation and a lot of rejects that come
[SPEAKER_01]: off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People look at the rejects that I do and
they go, well, geez, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you rejecting that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, didn't hit the mark for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out of here next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because life's too short to mess around
with crappy genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just raised the topic that you got
some reservations around autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to tell us what they
might be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like would we ever see a GUI auto
project in the works or is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: something you're interested in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm so busy just doing what I'm doing
and I've got so many irons in the fire
[SPEAKER_01]: with all of the stuff like this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adding more stuff is just not I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a possibility, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't considered it myself
as far as a separate project goal thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to be able to bring the brand
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's my main focus right now is
to bring the brand around to the public
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only just now kind of really fully
getting that it's different and that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not the same and people are hearing stuff
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the really the main focus of
all my attentions these last few years is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of getting that because I think it's
good for the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my heart and my efforts are really
concentrating on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned earlier the Black Platinum
Society is somewhere where you get some
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality genetics from, I was
wondering.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Platinum Society is mine and people
get their genetics from me to use in their
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the most famous breeders that I'm
not allowed to mention because that's part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Black Platinum Society's rules are
that we don't discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the other rules is that they
can use those genetics as their own and
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't have to promote them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In with my company or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always tell them might be a good
idea to tell people that they come from
[SPEAKER_01]: these genetics because just incites more
interest in that that genre or that that
[SPEAKER_01]: area, you know, that uniqueness and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would draw more people in to that
just by virtue of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a requisite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, no, that's something that I over
the years I've invited professional
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders and whether they want to go ahead
and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them approach me and then we go
ahead and talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's all right, then I go ahead and
I invite them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, that's something that comes from
me and goes out, not other ways coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my mistake on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my question I'm hoping is still
going to be just as relevant in that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering, you know, you've obviously got
a very reputable collection of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you keep your eye out for new land
races coming out in the sense that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: a guys like Indian Land Race Exchange and
stuff like that, who are doing these trips
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to source it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you keep your finger on that pulse at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I don't is because of the
same thing I've always said.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's their their their selling point
that I don't want to mix my genetics in
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to do is I want to take raw
genetics, whatever is left in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is as we've talked before,
you know, the gene pool is shrinking ever
[SPEAKER_01]: and ever more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you can still find these
little enclaves of areas where you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: lander stuff that's been bred by small
farmers in very remote areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can bring that stuff forward and
use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where my focus has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend who's a producer in
Hollywood, and he also goes around and
[SPEAKER_01]: does stock footage filming for the,
you know, the various industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that he does stock footage,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in his travels, he goes around and he's
the one that got me the African.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gotten me some Jamaican material
before that was very old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the kind of stuff that he
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes and he searches out these areas to
film and then happens across these
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, talks to them, gets their
confidence, and then sends me the material
[SPEAKER_01]: to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had great success with it that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that just, again,
brings more diversity into this field and
[SPEAKER_01]: allows more customer advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think customer advantage is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the only way to do it is to
get new stuff and that gene pool is
[SPEAKER_01]: shrinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's fun is that all my old stuff is
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I've kept it separate,
it's available for folks to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's fun to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really find that I find that I find that
so much fun because I know how it was when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a kid experiencing these new things
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to bring that pleasure to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think you can do it by mixing
even no matter how land or sea and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them benefit from that niche and enjoy
that, which they work very hard for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if somebody wants to take their
material and then they take some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: material and they blend them together and
they come up with something unique for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, that's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing on your Instagram,
you had mentioned that the Hawaiian Blush
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother, really special plant and something
you were hoping to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, what about it makes it so
special to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the blush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the blush is actually a combination
of a couple of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from there is an old family
in Hawaii that had some, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian varieties that they kept to
themselves and only use for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got some of their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a composite still of old island
strains, I believe, because I can see a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of different things in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it harkens back to the older Hawaiians
with those very unique Eastern flavors and
[SPEAKER_01]: that bright effervescent kind of a feel
that you get when you smoke a good
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian for the first time, where it kind
of grows and feels almost bubbly and
[SPEAKER_01]: effervescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is that kind of a feel,
very alive, awake, no suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mood, but very almost psychoactive,
you know, just very for a younger person
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't have as much THC in their
system as someone like me, it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: very psychoactive and very pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so using that line that they gave me
to be able to do that, I mixed it with
[SPEAKER_01]: what did I mix it with?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a color marker that I used,
and I don't think it had a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the color marker would go back to Zin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zin would be the, and that's a very
grapey kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to like to use that for a lot
of the flavor components that it had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that I think the Zin,
I don't have my notes with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have got my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a Zin cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do believe it was Zin times Cone of
Sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross with Zin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it was Hawaiian blush,
because the Hawaiian material that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: male that I used with it was crossed into
that female of the blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's where the Hawaiian blush
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually re-veged that and say that I
seeded the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I re-veged it just so they could
grow it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I see these dark purples and
stuff all the time that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just kind of get tired of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see something that has a nice
red hue to it, like the reds that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're new and different and showy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big plants look really, whoa,
you know, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm into it being a display.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wanted to come up with a
landscaping company that would tailor
[SPEAKER_01]: different pots for different areas in your
yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have edges and you could have
tall, wispy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would just be a beautiful yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got too many other things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to convert them to
perennials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that would be nice,
wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's why everybody always says
good gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how can you make an annual but a
perennial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you just control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, while we're on the topic of
Hawaii, one of our Patreon listeners would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to know if you could tell us a little
bit more about your connection to Hawaii
[SPEAKER_00]: and if there are any specific Hawaiian
genetics you feel really drawn to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've always liked the Big Island
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Island material always had the most
punch to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Maui's were cute and bright and nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Kauai electrics were always really
amazing materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know the Big Island always had the
punch to it that really set it apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Konas I was gifted were another old
strain that has been kept on that island
[SPEAKER_01]: for all these years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really resistant to mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grew big and has flavorful colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the punch is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really enjoyed the Kona more than I
really probably enjoyed anything else from
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, do you have any specific
history with Hawaii or it's just some way
[SPEAKER_00]: you really like?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually, I have a family over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to go over there quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus on Oahu, the first dispensary in
Hawaii, they use some of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a kind of a little bit of a soft
spot for just Hawaii, for what it's given
[SPEAKER_01]: for Maungui all those years ago with the
first 1972 Maui Wawis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of always was one of those
special things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, my dog needs to go out for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had no idea he was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's a 14-year-old dox and miniature
dox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's a good boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I like Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have always liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it was always a very challenging
place for a number of reasons as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really always attracted my attention
to that because you really I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that Hawaiians traditionally grew
stuff is they would put small plants out
[SPEAKER_01]: up on the hills and they would let it go
and they would come back a few months
[SPEAKER_01]: later and harvest and put another one in
its place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was always a very interesting
dance because of the police that were so
[SPEAKER_01]: vigilant about trying to do the
eradications over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always something that I always
thought was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any time I'd go into the back country,
I'd maybe take a few seeds and I'd spread
[SPEAKER_01]: them around into the jungles and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some people tell me they come
across purple plants that I've never seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I used to hide stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I go to Hawaii, I always have a
kind of a hunt for and I hide seeds on the
[SPEAKER_01]: island that I give people clues and they
go and they search them out and they
[SPEAKER_01]: always find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little treasure hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always enjoy doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, anybody in the world that goes
to Hawaii, go there and get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually make it worth their while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always a fun thing to do in
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I like Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a follow up from the same person who
asked that question, but sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were wondering and I don't know if
this actually has an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, do you have any cool stories
from when you did the photo shoot of The
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Desire with World Wide Magazine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Weed World Magazine?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, as a matter of fact, no, that was done
by a Canadian grower and photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okanavis is his name and he's the one who
initiated that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent him cuts of those plants because,
you know, he and I hit it off and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, here, let me help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you gave him that and he grew those
and then submitted it into the magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to print and they ran it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other references.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's in one of the 100 best sativas in
the world or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of books and things
and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just happy to be able to give people
something to photograph and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had another listener who asked if you
had any tips on taming really sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I always tell people if
you're going to have a stretchy,
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy plant like that to grow plantlet
method, do the plantlet method rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: growing full size plants, drew a whole
bunch of short cuttings and flower those
[SPEAKER_01]: out in mass, create a whole carpet full of
nothing but bud that ends up only getting
[SPEAKER_01]: about three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even on the stretchiest stuff,
start out with two, two inch clones and
[SPEAKER_01]: flower them directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the stretchiest plants will only
get up to about two or two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: three feet and they'll just be nothing but
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question I actually got from your
Instagram page, beautifully, beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: well thought out worded question from one
of your followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to know how do breeders
effectively work around the reality that
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic expressions are constantly moving
and given change, especially given changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that washes out with the
more experienced when growing and breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: lines or are there more nuances at it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, you know, it depends on what
you're talking about you're breeding with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes back to the selection of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have wide based genetics,
you're going to have wide based
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have narrow based expressions,
you're going to have narrow expressions
[SPEAKER_01]: come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my my biggest point I always tell
people is consistency and selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency and environment and
consistency in your methods of how you
[SPEAKER_01]: select what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will always overcome these nuanced
things that can come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can't control for an environment
that changes that's outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I always discourage people
from exclusively breeding outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something you need to experience and
you need to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not something that I think people
need to cut their teeth on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's easier to control an
indoor environment where you are learning
[SPEAKER_01]: all those aspects and are controlling what
you're seeing in this expressions of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that you can then dependably go
forward with a breeding project that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to give you predictable and
equitable results.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just that's just it all goes back
to simple stuff, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't make this stuff so complicated
and don't make it any more than it really
[SPEAKER_01]: has to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it comes back to what you're selecting
to use for your genetic gene pool to work
[SPEAKER_01]: in period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of these things have the same
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that it's been made to be believed
to be so complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's either two sets of ways of
looking at breeding from people who don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know anything about breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's an incredible
monumentous task.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who are breeders but are lazy
breeders think that pollen chucking is the
[SPEAKER_01]: answer and that you're going to hit it
right, you know, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of those are bad ways of looking
at things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's not how you deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand where you're coming
from with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on to a slightly different topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, we've had some guests on who
have discussed how there's the emergence
[SPEAKER_00]: of now cannabis specific pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the cannabis aphid you may have heard
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just one of possibly many
cannabis specific bugs that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of the fact that cannabis has
just been grown on such large scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on how we might
try to prevent more of these superbugs
[SPEAKER_00]: from emerging or what can we do to combat
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, that's a good question because,
you know, a breeder should be using bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: as an indicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: A breeder should be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugs for a breeder is something different
than they are for anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugs tell you what plants are the
preferred plants before the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: ever expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a group of plants,
like this set right here that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: showed you, the microbreeding,
if I go through those, there will be
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that have more bugs because they're
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be more plants with bugs on
it that once they have more bugs are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that are going to be sharper flavors,
heavier highs, more pronounced highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs know this before they even get to
this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always tell people pay attention
to bugs if you're a breeder because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're telling you they're pointing the
way early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having said that, when you get into
commercial stuff, you're starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: become a real issue with stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that in indoor crops where they can
have free rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always found that if I've had a
problem with something that I needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: control, natural methods seem to be as
good as chemical methods as far as,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, let's say, you know, oil on spider
mites, you know, tends to do the trick
[SPEAKER_01]: better than spreading poisons around that
linger and stay in and see deep into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and you ingest it ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I don't have any magic answers for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I'm not the right person to ask
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: My job is not production.
[SPEAKER_01]: My job is not producing beautiful,
thick plants that are going to be sold in
[SPEAKER_01]: stores and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my that's not my purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: My purpose is to design this stuff so that
you can take it and do that end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not the best person to ask about
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's another sort of similar
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really similar, but it's somewhat
related, I guess, in the sense that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are talking about male sex stability and
using these males as pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask you specifically,
have you ever bred with males that show
[SPEAKER_00]: some amount of female expression or do you
think that's just shitty intersex traits
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I see it, I even I've I've heard
all the accolades about they tend to fail,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, favor female expressions and and
all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, it's dirty genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just dirty genetics because I don't
care how good the quality is or how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got it in a mass and you're
trying to do something in the industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, you're doing that genetic like that
in there, you're ruining that whole crop
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're tainting that whole crop or
you're influencing that whole crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, getting rid of any intersecting
at all is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done it for years dealing with when
goo is being developed because the tie had
[SPEAKER_01]: a tendency to show some hermaphrodism if
it was pushed any at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that would be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to breed that out of subsequent
gooey stuff because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: even in even in the later stages of
growing the pure gooey and designing the
[SPEAKER_01]: pure gooey, it was very much something
that I had to watch for because recesses
[SPEAKER_01]: would emerge and they would come in and
then all of a sudden you'd see expressions
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you see them very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times you'd see them really late in
flowering anything that displayed anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was immediately removed from the gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look on that topic of removing things from
the gene pool, I know that you you end up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not releasing a good majority of
the things you end up making because you
[SPEAKER_00]: decide you're not up to scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to put a number on it,
what percentage of crosses do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: don't make the cut for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, very strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, seriously, I'm dead serious
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everything that you see won't make
it past the second the second set of
[SPEAKER_01]: tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything out there that I showed on
Instagram and stuff is all great.
[SPEAKER_01]: First F1 material that that you can see
that particular strain giving that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it goes through another set of tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are put through rigors for
stress for different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: of tolerances for nutrient and stuff like
that, because everybody knows I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: to spend money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cheap as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I build in that economy into these
plants so that I get complaints all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time about people saying that my plants
burn easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will produce just as much with half
of the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're designed to do that because I
don't want to spend a lot of money on
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and expensive stuff when I don't
need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can get the same thing with half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're designed to be to be sensitive
like that, because you don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll save you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's for the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: An act of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting you raise that point,
because there's currently a discussion on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Instagram community about like,
what is due diligence with testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of to summarize that people are
like, yeah, it's all well and good if you
[SPEAKER_00]: test your plants and get good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to give it to the shittest
grower there is because they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: expose it to stuff you're not going to,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I wasn't so sold on that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think testing things yourself and
if it passes, that's good enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think you really have to stress
it out a bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the answer that's simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've already actually touched on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't use anything but soil and
cow shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my stuff is all designed around that
basic mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let's just say that no one someone
who doesn't know and I've said this many
[SPEAKER_01]: times to many people online before that
everything is geared towards the person
[SPEAKER_01]: who doesn't know what they're doing to
still get optimum results for as little
[SPEAKER_01]: effort as they're going to put into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of us know that there's
people out there that kill plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kill them with kindness.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kill them with caring.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kill them with just an over-sense of
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is designed for people who are
the other end of that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kill them because they're lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're killing them because they don't
pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're killing them because they didn't
give them enough of what it was to do what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why less nutrients are needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get the same expressions with full
plants, big flowers, nice resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: good flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just soil and cow shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm already designing for the base that
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I tell you that there's
people out there that do amazing things
[SPEAKER_01]: with my stuff that I can't even do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other end of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That spectrum that they took it to that
next level that the plant was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: handle and utilize the maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got even better than what would
happen with cow shit and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything is geared towards cow shit
and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've already built in those
designs for these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I'm meant to do is to
make it easy for the simplest person to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the best results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, you just gave me a great segue
because you spoke about people doing
[SPEAKER_00]: really well with your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you referenced Joel of Northstar
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to bring that up quickly and
just sort of ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see he does a lot of projects with your
lines in them and they look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me sort of wondering,
is there any distinct differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: your work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if he did a cross that used two of
your lines, is that sort of just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: gooey breeder strain in a way?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me address that because Joel and Jen
are just, they're phenomenal people and
[SPEAKER_01]: they really are, they know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good at what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's using a diverse enough genetic
set that he's making totally different
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff than what I'm making.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does tend to think have a tendency to
use some of the more commercial stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: his, some of his lines, but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I just really think that he's
got a different expression up to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where like let's call, let's just,
and he will say this too, dirty little
[SPEAKER_01]: secret is one of his most famous strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually the one that I was
speaking with, with Mark Emery talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about how he thought that was some of the
best pot he's ever tasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's dark desire and, and purple
mayhem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are both mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joel acknowledges that whenever he,
you know, somebody asks him, he says,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, basically it's a gooey strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, he just maestroed it
with the masterful skill that he has into
[SPEAKER_01]: a wonderful set of selections that he was
able to cross and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I support that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want him to, you know, he, I think he
was even going to keep that going just
[SPEAKER_01]: because he wanted to have that set of
genetics, because it gets so much
[SPEAKER_01]: attention and brings so much people into
the fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a little bit of gooey breeder
that they've heard about, and he makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: much more readily available than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they get a little bit of that,
but then they get to experience his stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and his, and the things that he's designed
in conjunction with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so he benefits from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's just exactly why I
gave him the genetics, because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them to death and I want them to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody's got to carry this shit on
when I croak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really, I mean, he, I was kind of
hoping that he'd help carry the mantle
[SPEAKER_01]: among other breeders, you know,
and just keep it going and keep the brand
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, but he's tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys have worked their butts off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Jen's in Philadelphia right now at
a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're far flung.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to New Jersey to go to shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one they tried to do there
was canceled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, you know, it cost them a bunch
of money, but they're out there getting
[SPEAKER_01]: it, trying to get it done, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I admire that they work well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that they're somebody that
people ought to experience more of their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always looked at their work and
thought it looks really interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's unique combinations in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sort of just touched on,
you know, yeah, as a community,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had some struggles, you know,
with shows being canceled, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects everyone in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of something I realized there
were parallels with is during COVID,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've also had a sort of a cannabis plant
COVID in the sense that the hoplatin virus
[SPEAKER_00]: has really taken a stranglehold on the
community over the past two years that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been dealing with COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you don't bring in a lot of
genetics to your library, but have you had
[SPEAKER_00]: any experiences with it at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess a good reason why to keep your
stuff to you and don't bring external in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, and I also do,
I do harden everything so that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's within itself, it's very
strong so that it can withstand,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when people sit there and
say, oh, you know, it attracts powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are some genetics in there
that are prone to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, mom GUI in her later
periods of life has become much more prone
[SPEAKER_01]: to possibly getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you control the bloom, then it
might as well not have it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just figure at this stage with
her age and everything, and the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptibility is that you just kind of
got to control it rather than try to breed
[SPEAKER_01]: it out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because quite frankly, there are just some
things that follow along the very
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable lines that it's going to take a
while to breed out specifically and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had mixed results with doing that
with plants where there are some stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that you just can't get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in GUI stuff, powdery mildew can be an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now other people have had really great
success in mold-prone environments where
[SPEAKER_01]: they say it's very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I can't speak to that
because I can't see it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's anecdotal at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can only speak from what I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was curious, I seen you've been
posting recently about a strain called
[SPEAKER_00]: island fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember a few years back,
I grew out one of your freebies called
[SPEAKER_00]: island mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was beautiful strain, very
tropical, great structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, did the island mix
somehow make it into the island fire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That island fire uses the same genetics
that went into the Kona sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the pure Kona, I do believe,
went into island fire along with a subset
[SPEAKER_01]: from the death grip line that was really
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a really strong initial feel to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it would just grab you and shake you
right off the bat and then leave a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very noticeable long lasting buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I use that and I got the balance
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just a little bit hairy
still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf wise for me as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had hopes of releasing that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm thinking I'm going to refine
it a little bit more and get rid of some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the, because the best plants are a
little leafy, I think for my taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could trim it out and it would be
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's beautiful stuff, very,
very distinct coloring, towering,
[SPEAKER_01]: huge colas, very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still needs a little more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, it's good to hear it's almost
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of our Patreon submitted
questions was they were wondering what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics behind the Black Raptor and
what sort of traits would crosses with
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Raptor in it bring to the table?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're trying to figure out which
cross is going to be best for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Raptor is based on midnight snow and
Black Raptor is basically a dark midnight
[SPEAKER_01]: snow, but it has a definite heavier feel
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavors are along the same lines,
but the Raptor is a lot heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use the, people might remember a
lemon purple male that I had that was just
[SPEAKER_01]: about black and a beautiful, stunning kind
of a black cola, really long, I love that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is that plant I crossed with a
midnight snow, dark desire, old Mendo haze
[SPEAKER_01]: and gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that made the flavor really pronounced
and really heavy as far as a bright in
[SPEAKER_01]: your face kind of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then use the male purple, lemon purple
in and mixed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that one was the father of the
Black Raptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was hit to a pure midnight snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's set the color, it's set the
flavor, and it just deepened the smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: deepened the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And midnight snow is already around 24%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Black Raptor is a little higher,
but it's really a nice, I always like it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning because it's such a bright,
it doesn't taste like orange juice,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has that same effect as drinking
your glass of orange juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really bright, effervescent in the
mouth and really opens your eyes and gets
[SPEAKER_01]: your day going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, lovely, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting sort of genetic
component I'd seen you working with was
[SPEAKER_00]: the cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That caught my eye, I'm like such a
die-hard cinnamon fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering what genetics are in
that and is it truly cinnamon?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cinnamon actually came not from
the taste, but it was described as
[SPEAKER_01]: cinnamon from the look and color that it
would come from because it had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: amber to the resin right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a cinnamon color bud when
you kind of dried it and got it ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the smell and taste were very bright,
very floral, kind of unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do not remember where the cinnamon
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had had that thing for years and years
and years, and I don't remember what its
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic makeup was or where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been given to me,
but no, it did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a cinnamon profile in the
flavor, but God darn, it looked like
[SPEAKER_01]: cinnamon colored with that beautiful,
especially when you made ash out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd think it was cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, wow, of course, cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's where the cinnamon came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when Australians have like a
sort of cool backstory to them like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, I love to ask every guest
his question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What seeds is gooey excited to pop next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a backlog of eight years right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've trimmed off two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 10 at the beginning of this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've cut down to eight years of backlog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I make seed every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many different kinds I
make.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the year and what it's for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm doing stuff for clients or
something like that, I'll go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep a portion of those for my own
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always agreed upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always tell them I won't be
releasing this in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just be using it in genetic research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got about eight years of stuff
with their stuff that I have never
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned and I have never told anybody
I've had yet just because it hasn't come
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just hasn't come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I thought I'd do is I'm going
back to that old working on this three
[SPEAKER_01]: foot area of space to clean up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dealing with a small set of genetics
and refining those and getting those out
[SPEAKER_01]: to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to be moving into this
next stage and doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people will see less from me during
that interim period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'm working on the sets of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the black lines, those kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on those to be able to have
something to tide people over while I get
[SPEAKER_01]: this next set of things ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see how far, how many times I
can do this before I end up six feet
[SPEAKER_01]: under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think you'll be around for a while
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hopes, one hopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're very kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I echo the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, how breeders work is a different
question than how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you right now, I work with a
set of reps and I let them deal with with
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I turn it over to a rep, it's their
gig.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could do whatever they want,
however they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they highlight the brand in a
positive light as it should be,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless it doesn't deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't deserve it, I want the rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the rep to be able to feel that and
then say, hey, look out for this,
[SPEAKER_01]: or he told me this, or because it does
this, we're going to give you free this as
[SPEAKER_01]: a replacement to make sure that you,
the customer are taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of attitude pervades
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm smoking gooey again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, my wife is saying that it's
about time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I had, I had one final question for
you that I was interested to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: take on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of mum gooey, there's been a
variety of different pure gooey's and
[SPEAKER_00]: various sort of recombinations of gooey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is the most standout in your
mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, that's a weird question as far
as are you talking about other things like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an old goo that comes from Santa
Cruz that was been around since the
[SPEAKER_01]: seventies and it's different than gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, whether people are still using that
goo, or not, it has been described to me
[SPEAKER_01]: as being really similar, really similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never had it tested or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause sometimes, you know, we'll,
we'll genetically test things to see if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, somebody was questioning
AF GUI and they have shown that in
[SPEAKER_01]: subsequent tests that mum gooey is,
is the mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that hasn't happened with other
goo strains since there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that name stuff, you know, they don't,
they don't know, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That, uh, especially the newer breeders
and whatnot, they don't bother to look up
[SPEAKER_01]: and see what's active online or what's
been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just name something, something,
and then it gets its own little traction
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you have to be aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the fun things that
people can count on with Canada exotics
[SPEAKER_01]: and this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that this genetics has been around a
long time and it has a long history that
[SPEAKER_01]: people can follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and that seems to be lacking in
the other kinds of expressions that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking to, you know, you don't find that
history to be able to, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: avail yourself of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of tend to just fall back on
that whenever, whenever people ask me
[SPEAKER_01]: about other variations or other,
uh, materializations of something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, I just kind of fall back on only
what I know and go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have time for one last quick
one?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be interested to hear what's your
thoughts on how legalization has turned
[SPEAKER_00]: out versus how you thought it would go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually always thought it would be a
lot more, uh, streamlined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I knew that there was always
going to be a little bit of contention and
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of, of societal, um,
unrest around it as you transition from a
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's been traditionally
illegal and always has been and always was
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective to be that is going to be
illegal because it was deemed bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, war on drugs kind of thing and
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it, uh, uh, it started to shift
and legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I kind of think has gone and swung the
pendulum the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too far where it's over-regulated,
it's over-controlled, um, overtaxed,
[SPEAKER_01]: over, um, overproduced and overbred with
too many holes in each of those systems
[SPEAKER_01]: with different stuff falling through all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a more measured, um, type of
method needed to be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jeannie's out of a bottle now and
we've got a kind of adjustment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we've ever been here before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't, you know, we didn't,
you, you knew kind of how society was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just didn't know which direction and
how far, how fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're seeing all of that right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of just tend to think that
cooler heads will prevail eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it'll settle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a plan with the legal material
that I'm trying to get set up where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to provide genetic stock for
vineyard people that are wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert a portion of their land over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we want to provide those,
uh, genetics and a consistent multi-year
[SPEAKER_01]: contract kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, uh, we're, you know, you have to,
you know, bounce in to the system that's
[SPEAKER_01]: set up with, with the reality that of what
the future may hold and the future may
[SPEAKER_01]: hold a very low price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of our pricing is based on $275
a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're still able to do, you know,
make a good living, uh, on that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, right now it's nowhere near that
here, but it's nowhere near where the apex
[SPEAKER_01]: of how it used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, over 4,000 a pound,
nowhere near that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the people that got into the
industry when that was going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was their target.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought they were going to say,
it was going to stay like that forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the pendulum is going to
end up, you know, being in the middle and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, uh, until we vacillate through
this stuff and get, and work back and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the entities that are against it
have their say and all the ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: for it have their say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, I think we're in for some
tumultuous years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the intelligence gets all settled
and it gets normalized and the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government goes ahead and normalizes
things and has one consistent set of laws
[SPEAKER_01]: for it that are governed by the whole
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'll see, then you'll see,
you know, real progress until then
[SPEAKER_01]: fractionalization and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really an impediment, really an
impediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wise words there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gu, were there any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really want to thank everybody that
bothers to give this old guy a listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your patronage.

[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that you'll allow me to enjoy
the fruits of your labor by maybe giving
[SPEAKER_01]: me a look-see at what you've produced and
show people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always, always open to criticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather hear people's negative
thoughts and stuff about material because
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned more from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this stage in my life, I like to
learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way I can do that is with
your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you.
