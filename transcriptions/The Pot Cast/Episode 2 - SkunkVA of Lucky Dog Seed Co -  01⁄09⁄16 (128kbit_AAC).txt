[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to the second episode of

[SPEAKER_02]: enthusiasts.

[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, we're joined by Skunk VA,
who was kind enough to give us some
[SPEAKER_02]: in-depth history on the scene as well as a
killer recount of how he came to acquire
[SPEAKER_02]: the 91 cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: His general plans for the future and some
general thoughts on the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further ado, I'd like to
welcome our next guest onto the show,
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, thanks so much for taking the
time to talk to us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so before we get into it, I'm just
going to basically remind everyone that
[SPEAKER_02]: for this interview, we're going to refer
to the man Chem Dog as Mass G or just G
[SPEAKER_02]: and the strain as Chem Dog or the 91 or
the VA cutting just so we can hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid some confusion because that's
something which comes up a lot when
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about this type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing I was going to say is
for this interview, I think kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: most fitting way to start it would be to
actually kind of start at the middle and
[SPEAKER_02]: then go back to the start just so that
people kind of have an understanding of
[SPEAKER_02]: where you fit into the whole scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so far, the story online seems to be
what I gather, pretty inaccurate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, you met Matt Mass G online on
Overgrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two of you chatted, became friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ended up trading clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the 91 off him and he got the
skunk from you or the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some years later, Chem got raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lost his clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, you guys met back up and you
gave him the 91 back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are a few years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: How accurate is that story in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely pieces of that that add
up or that are true, but that's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't meet G until 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the chem dog in 1995, a few days
before Jerry Garcia died in July of 1995.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace, Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see, I'm going to McLaren
Park tomorrow in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Jerry Garcia Day at the amphitheater.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually called Jerry Garcia
Amphitheater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty excited about it, but yes,
rest in peace, Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for everything out there,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened was, I'm just going to
start from the beginning, how I came into
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Virginia originally and lots of
us people, lots of us young folks from
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia, my age, we ended up on Grateful
Dead Tour because that's what was going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in America at the time, like 1988,
1989, 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like every time they passed
through, they would take a whole nother
[SPEAKER_00]: wave of us with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason, when you were on
tour, there was a lot of people from
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really explain it to you,
but there was a lot of people from
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found myself following the Grateful
Dead around and pretty much left Virginia
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a full time thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is, and of course
there's not a show every night and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a tour going on constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three or four tours a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bunch of other Jerry Garcia
band or Grateful Dead shows that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would, Jerry Garcia band shows that you
might catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were always centered around San
Francisco in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, in between tours, you would find
yourself in the Bay area, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting around for the next show
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways that we would kind of
put food in our mouths and when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Grateful Dead show, it was really
easy to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money was in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anybody who's 35 or 40 years old,
30 or older knows what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But between shows, life can get kind of
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found myself in San Francisco
hanging around the Panhandle Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, of course, marijuana was
very difficult to find at times,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the summertime before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there just wasn't the type of indoor
volume going on as we have today
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pot prices could be anywhere from 400
to $450 for a weight ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get a weight ounce for that price,
you were getting hooked up by your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would do is we would get ounces
and we would break them into what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: hates, which were like 2.8 grams,
and get a couple little extra ones out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically find customers in the
park who were, honestly, 80% of those
[SPEAKER_00]: people were ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see sometimes that more than
often that there was something going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where they would come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a shady transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time because selling marijuana was a
felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just kids in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like fish in a barrel,
if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, that's what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was growing up in Virginia,
we smoked stuff like the Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the 86 Super Skunk later on,
which was also later called the Mass
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk, the Mass Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get to that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the things that we were growing were a
lot of things out of the Super Sativa Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when they started coming out,
but I've got a few of them digitally
[SPEAKER_00]: archived.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy about that because they
had the numbers and what they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the fellow who went all
around the world and buddied up with
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the Kush Mountains in
Afghanistan or Africa or even the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow he had this network of
breeders all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in Virginia, that was probably
one of his seed producers because we
[SPEAKER_00]: always seemed like we always had the cream
of the crop of what the stuff was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some even, for instance,
the Beatrix Choice, which was always my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite before I left my hometown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the Holy Grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, oh my God, you got a bag of
Beatrix Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the catalog, I think in the 87
version, he actually mentioned Central
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so yeah, in between,
I think it was, it must've been January of
[SPEAKER_00]: 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the park and I was kind of always
away from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of a, I don't know,
kind of more, I didn't like doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me very uncomfortable,
but this is kind of what we did to make it
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a hotel that night, get a floor space
that night, get us some food in our belly,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, just kind of make it to the next
day so we can be around when the next
[SPEAKER_00]: shows start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically I was sitting on the bench
and this guy comes walking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big moment in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew it at the time, but this guy
comes walking down the sidewalk and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got this grin on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a ponytail and he comes walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got me locked in his eyes and he
comes walking through the panhandle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he walks right up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew, I was like, this guy either
really, really needs a sack of weed or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, maybe just maybe he's got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did, he offered me, he goes,
Hey, and he had a heavy, heavy New York
[SPEAKER_00]: accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started talking and he didn't waste
any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked him, I said, Hey,
do you need a sack of weed or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, actually bro, I was going to
ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy has like the quintessential
heaviest net New York accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just knew so, cause he had that,
he had that look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had growers all over the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, everywhere we went,
you would look for those familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy you saw somewhere in that area
last time, you know, in the little,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, set of shows, four or five or
six in Ohio area, you'd see this guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe even don't even remember
his name, but you know, his face and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: always got the kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you were on tour, that was really
a big part of your day was you had to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to get a ticket for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not necessarily in this
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the ticket always came first and you
had to find yourself some headstache.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, the headstache was always the
most challenging part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were like me and you didn't
really have your own ride, you had to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a ride to the next show, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so he, we started talking and
he goes, listen, man, I just moved out
[SPEAKER_00]: here from New York city in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my electricity is getting ready to get
turned off tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my girlfriend from Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if you could help me,
it would be, I would really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just like, dude, you have no
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to help each other
both, you know, mutually a lot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he takes me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We walked back to his van and he's got one
of those, he's got one of those extended,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like when you see an extended
van, like one of the big old cargo vans
[SPEAKER_00]: and it had like the line at the back of
the van where you can see where the,
[SPEAKER_00]: they extended it to get the extra three or
four feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line, this van actually had another
line with another set or two feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing was like 17, 18 feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the biggest van I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're parked, he parked like on a
pretty sharp hill in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get in there and he's like,
I'm like, well, first off, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, how much, how much are you going to
be, you know, how much would you sell this
[SPEAKER_00]: to me for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned, cannabis,
marijuana, it was going for $450 an ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: that day from your buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to wait for him to get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to wait for him to get down to the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you had to divvy it out because
everybody needed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like you're the first person to
get to see and you wanted two ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he would just give you one
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes to make sure you have other
outs for, you know, somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of his other friends is going to say,
you know, it was always a hassle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and this guy starts pulling out
this amazing indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and the indoor, you know,
you would find it down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the city at those days, but it was
extremely rare, even in California in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early nineties like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was mostly outdoor, beautiful
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say even nicer outdoor than we see
these days, but, but still indoor was very
[SPEAKER_00]: rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he had a string called Francine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a very small amount of Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me about, and, and, and,
and I was very impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't have any for me to, to buy or
anything like that, but he had,
[SPEAKER_00]: we smoked a little bit while we were chit
chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking about, you know,
grateful dad and nugs and all the things
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk about when you meet someone,
you know, people, kindred people meet like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you know, and, uh, he had,
uh, what else do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he had this other really fluffy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, fluffy was the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could get the fluffy we'd like,
cause it just looks bigger when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: only weighing 2.8, you know, grams out,
you know, and, uh, or I'll get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and, and he was like, I was like,
all right, so what, what do you want for
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, cause I'm ready to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if he wants $450 an ounce,
then we're going to go up to the street
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to find everybody in
hoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to sell for 450 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think 300 would be good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I almost kissed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yes, I think that would be
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that'd be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but you have to do me one favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to stay right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't go wandering around and every
single kid that you see with a backpack
[SPEAKER_00]: and a skateboard, don't walk up to him and
ask him, cause you know, I'm going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, let me take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would appreciate it, you know,
and I'll make sure that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get your money and you go home and pay
your electric bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so he's like, no problem,
man, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought himself up a few joints and
we, we got some books and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found his van and we made like a nice
little level spot and we started weighing
[SPEAKER_00]: the mugs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing went well all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kept running back and forth down
the street and I hope the statue of
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations has run out on that crime,
but I think this was, I think January,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hard time with this particular
date and in my own little personal
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline here because, but I'm pretty sure
it was January, 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so anyways, I made a pocket full
of money and a big fat sack of killer
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor head stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy really had some of the best
indoor I've ever seen so far in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd seen quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fortunate enough to see quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he told me he goes, man,
I'm, I'm so appreciative.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, I was very appreciative,
but he was 10 fold appreciative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he was like, I, it was out of
proportion, how appreciative he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, man, it's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, I'm going to go sleep in
downtown tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going out to the Marine and crash
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go get my own damn room
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so anyway, um, he said,
listen to me, I live here because Jerry
[SPEAKER_00]: Garcia plays at the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole reason I moved out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, California is a dream
to me, but I came here to see Jerry Garcia
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just in case anybody
doesn't know what that means, like Jerry
[SPEAKER_00]: Garcia at the Warfield was like church to
a dead head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's like, that's you get,
you get, you get as close as possible back
[SPEAKER_00]: then, you know, concerts, grateful dead
concert for big events, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: three days at a stadium with 90,000 people
in it, you know, no problem sold out and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably another 20,000 people who don't
even have tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mayhem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see Jerry Garcia at a roughly,
I think, I think the Warfield's like 12 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1600 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a pretty small theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old theater in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very special thing, you know,
and playing his music that he wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: play us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he would play on average
air three to six shows every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you average it out,
you know, so it was a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, they had these tables there and
he said to me, he goes, Hey, I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get up at the morning at the crack of
dawn at 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go down to the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole group of friends that I
know just from sitting in this line,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so I can get this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'd like to come, I will always
save you a chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm just that appreciative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will always say save you a chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always welcome to come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, sure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there was some shows coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and he, and so I did,
I went down there and sure enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: the man, he was almost like you could wait
to see me, you know, and I get there and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my spot, you know, for,
for the rest of the time the Jerry was
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always went and sat that chair next to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and then it was, it was an
amazing experience just being there
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, this guy was quite the
networker himself, as far as growers
[SPEAKER_00]: around the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, you know, doesn't just travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously, you know, we go all over
the place to see this stuff we did still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, growers from all over the country
would come and they would link up with
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and come set the table and bring
their wares and bring their, their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their ganja, you know, like their,
their, their best buds, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Steve parish would come from behind
the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was Jerry Garcia's tech sound guitar,
man, probably his bounce for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: every, he was everything to Jerry in the
professional setting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was the guy who wiped down Jerry's
guitar between separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he would come out, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would smoke with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ramrod came out a couple of times that he
was visiting to see a Jerry show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a, uh, another roadie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the Grateful Dead and Bob Snodgrass and
Maria Snodgrass would come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also they, they're Bob Snodgrass is the
guy who probably blew the very first glass
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana pipe, you know, and this is
where I get the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look confused because it seemed like
back then when we were young, and I
[SPEAKER_00]: probably, I would imagine everybody feels
this way, but back when we were young,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a month or like a season could seem
like a year in your memory, as you look
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your life, you know, you're like,
how could that much stuff happen in my
[SPEAKER_00]: life in that short period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I got older, I've always kind of
tripped out on that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it wasn't too long after I met him
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, Jerry was always playing
there that, uh, I asked, I asked this guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Hey, uh, Hey man, is it okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, I would tell him about the
super Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell him about the super Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah, this is nice,
but you should see this stuff in my
[SPEAKER_00]: hometown or, you know, it's always like
the fish that got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd tell him about the super Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he had, like I said,
friends all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, well, you got to get me
some, you know, I want to check it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always talking about the super Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one night or one weekend or a week or
whatever, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the, uh, some of the people that I
grew up growing, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that grew the weed that I smoked
when I was growing up, came out to see
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry at the Warfield and it linked up
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Hey, I'm gonna ask my
buddy to see if you guys want to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: the table, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all have amazing puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just ask my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked the guy, the table guy,
you know, and I said, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_00]: would it be cool if these guys came?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they got, they brought some
super skunk with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a chance to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, hell yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I was just a pretty much a
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was, you know, what 19 at the
time or 20, 21 or 21, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, these guys were grown
men most of them, even to my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: the person I'm talking about with the
debt, shared his seat at the table with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, they were all growers
and they had their own discussions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about people from Virginia
and I don't know if Tommy told you this or
[SPEAKER_00]: you may, I guess he lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really need to, he doesn't need
to tell you, but it's a harsh place for
[SPEAKER_00]: people who, who, uh, you know,
are involved with cannabis and any,
[SPEAKER_00]: any vast, it's smoking any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, you can get yourself in a
lot of trouble there with the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course that leads to a culture
of a lot of quiet, you know, reserves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you, you gotta watch who you
talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to really watch your step and
keep your business to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, you know, even just grow
some headstache for yourself there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how those guys were.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't talk about anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that even though I knew they smoked,
they didn't talk about with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I was okay, okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was surprised that they, you know,
they opened up to each other and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, you know, and you know, they came
back out for another set of shows and we
[SPEAKER_00]: got to all know each other over that
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, finally some of the boys from
Virginia said to me, they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, listen, your body from New York,
he asked us about, if we could get them
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you tell him?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, uh, you know, we kind of,
we kind of didn't really answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you known this guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, you know,
I haven't known him very long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he, you know, I know a lot about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, you know, he's an all right
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, they took my, took my,
I felt like they went out on a limb
[SPEAKER_00]: because they took the 21 year olds,
you know, advice that, Hey, this guy's
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to talk to him a little bit and
get to know him, exchange phone numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, which was a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, today it seems silly to think
about that, but it was a really big deal
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, quick, quick order,
you know, they actually went, went,
[SPEAKER_00]: went into process and, and, uh,
what the plan was, was he was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring a couple of cuttings out.
[SPEAKER_00]: From, uh, Sonoma County, fly them out to
New York where he's from and get a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of Kim dog cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was going to meet them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to drive it from Virginia
with some super scunt cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple, and then, uh, and then make an
exchange and they were going to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim dog back to Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I think, you know what, thinking back,
I think they were actually going for this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had called the Francine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I don't, I haven't seen it in
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the only one that ever showed his
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Northern lights kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, when he went back there,
he, uh, got a couple of Kim dog cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in 1993 still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to been 1993 and, uh, and he took
a, he went back and got a couple of Kim
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs locally from that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he was tied into that whole Kim
dog family that was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to grow Kim dog in a park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would sell, they would sell the
stuff in central park for $800 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it was crazy, but he was tied into
that, to that crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somehow he got some Kim dog cuttings
and then they came up with the super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: and they made an exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in order to kind of pay whoever
helped him out, he gave them a super scunt
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so he brought back the Kim dog.
And then he got a couple of Kim dog
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim dog and the super skunk back to the
West coast, the guy, the New York guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how he got out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that was the trade that,
that eventually, as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way I understand it is that's
where the mass skunk became the mass skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: was that super skunk cutting that came up
from Virginia.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then I don't know all this because
I wasn't there for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I know that's what happened
because, you know, I knew all the people
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, but I don't know what happened
to super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent, but I'll definitely
have seen pictures of the mass super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without a doubt, that's the mass
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sorry, the super skunk,
the 86 super sativa club, super skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the most distinctive bud because it
always had this one little pregnant belly
[SPEAKER_00]: that would pop off on not all around the
bud, but only on one side and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily on the side the light was on,
but only on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at it's a, um,
in that 86 catalog or the 87, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: two, it's very distinct that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks exactly like the seed that was
popped where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the same one that they called
the mass skunk that I saw later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all this stuff, you know,
I like to say that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: back then, like, of course we didn't
really have cell phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had sky pagers was the brand new thing
where you could get a page anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cutting edge revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was no Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no email.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no cell phones, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's amazing what the Grateful
Dead did to connect people around the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and to, you know,
keep these things alive that were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to be stamped out by the government at the
height of the drug war in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, it can't, it can never
be like overemphasized, like how much that
[SPEAKER_00]: community had a role in making sure that
cannabis kept evolving through those
[SPEAKER_00]: years, those dark years in the United
States, you know, Well, that was actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, I was going to say that was going
to be the next question I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually ask was, you know, at the end of
the day, how much do you think the
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead did influence the cannabis
scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like when I look at it,
I tend to think that if they weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: around, you could almost argue that,
you know, like none of this would exist in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of, you know, I mean, you'd have
your skunk number one in that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, in terms of the cam dog and
all the OG cushion, everything that's
[SPEAKER_02]: alineated out from it, it just wouldn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anybody my age or older or even
younger, a little bit younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: knows that, you know, it had, there was
nothing going on in America like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was nothing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the drug war had a huge,
when I act like it's over, it's not over,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's definitely, we're on the other
side of it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's waning now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our side has now made its case that,
Hey man, you know, you're destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking people's family and crushing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just for a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're definitely got, we've
definitely got America's attention now
[SPEAKER_00]: about what an atrocity occurred during
those years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, from, from this 1970,
from the early seventies, when this whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they basically scheduled drugs in the
United States and put cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one category, meaning it has no
medical value whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still look at that day,
you know, all the way through until
[SPEAKER_00]: basically until nine 11, I would even say,
because I think maybe that took a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the resources away from the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was dark in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, you had to really be committed
to these types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was no, you know, it was no,
you didn't take these things lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, if you did, you were playing
with fire and you know, you really could
[SPEAKER_00]: be finding yourself in for a big surprise,
you know, and there's a, there's one,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one saying, you know, as far in
Grateful Dead land is that there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: land of darkness, the, the carriage of
the, uh, in the land of darkness,
[SPEAKER_00]: the carriage of light is drawn by the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of what it was like,
you know, they literally, their mission,
[SPEAKER_00]: their mission from the get-go was to go
into the dark corners of the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: and the world, but really United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this was, this is about this,
this band and this culture was about
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about, you know, where's the
freedom, you know, like where's the
[SPEAKER_00]: adventure that we all read about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is it over?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just, we're just spectators of
the past, you know, like it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was right now and it was happening and
it was, it was, they took this circus into
[SPEAKER_00]: every dark corner of this country and they
found kids like myself who were just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: really?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your freedom that I've been
getting caught about in fourth grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they really, that's,
you know, when I say they, I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a guy playing a guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about me, everybody who was
part of that, you know, and the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: and the band of course was catalyst and
people who put it all on the line because
[SPEAKER_00]: of what they believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what it boiled down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never about, it was just about,
you know, I don't really know what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about just trying to make a more
free world where you can be yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, I think that cannabis
played was a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that was just a,
it was all, it was a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was in the background, but it was also
in the foreground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big part of that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's where growers met
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you met a guy in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how you meet a guy in the
park in San Francisco when you're 21,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's eventually going to give you the
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it worked, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyways, I'm sorry for getting
sidetracked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting back to the story, just to
clarify, cause I think some people may not
[SPEAKER_02]: have picked up on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said the New York guy,
that's how he got the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a mass G you're referring to,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this guy, I'm going to leave this
guy's name out of it for now because I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't talked to him about, you know,
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to clarify for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our New York friend has got this super
skunk now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and he, and he, like I said,
he brought one cutting back to the West
[SPEAKER_00]: coast and he, to him with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cause that's what, you know,
he's doing it for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he left one with the people,
his friends in New York, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually that got up to
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the story goes that that eventually got
up to Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think G has talked a little
bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could probably tell you more about
like, what, how did that get from Staten
Island?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and say Staten Island up to
where he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he was tied in with those folks
because they, their whole thing was the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how he was connected to
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I didn't, to those guys,
I just don't know, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met that guy until 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want, and then going forward from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he brings it back and he's like,
man, you know, he started growing it here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he basically, I'm like,
look, the only thing I ask is every time
[SPEAKER_00]: you harvest, sell me all the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would sell me these tupperwares a
week, not even in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and my friends would just smoke it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was no, it was just for us,
you know, and it was, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I can't believe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking my favorite weed, the super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grew up better than anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this guy really knows what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we became close for friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we got a little closer,
he said to me one day, he goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, when this whole grateful dead thing
ends, you know, I would just want to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you, like, I want to offer to you that I
will give you genetics and I will show you
[SPEAKER_00]: what everything I know about growing
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I was like, great, cause that's
exactly what I'm going to do when this is
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the plan all along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, as soon as that was always the
problem of tour to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was like, man, I can be growing
marijuana somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hadn't really, I'd only done it once
before I left Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but it was just, I knew that's
what I would have wanted it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love kind buds, you know, you're going
to have plenty of those and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: win-win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, uh, so Jerry did die a few years
later and I, I went to him and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I said, all right, man,
I'm coming up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move to Sonoma County and I'm
going to get a place and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up being my wife at one point
and, uh, she, uh, had convinced me,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's, uh, let's start settling down
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she was still in college and
then, uh, you know, she was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonoma state university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so we were going to move up there
and I, you know, I've got a hold of my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were getting a place up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is before Jared Garcia died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it was that, it was that summer
of 95, like June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we went up there, we found a
place and I, I called him up and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know, I'm here, come over and,
you know, he came over the house and we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, look, man, I'm selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to made a little money recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go buy some lights and
whatever else you think I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I want to get this,
I got this bedroom here and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing some pot in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, all right, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring it over to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he brings me over my super skunk,
you know, and he brings over the chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, oh, he brought over like some
herni CD pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that was the other thing back then we
never, ever the, one of the things was
[SPEAKER_00]: that the first thing I heard was if you
ever find any seeds in your pot and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: them away, eat them, don't grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll always be shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of course later on we found out
that's not necessarily true, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he comes, he comes through and,
uh, he does all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he literally, this all happened like
the week before Jerry died.
[SPEAKER_00]: He died on August 9th, 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought all this up over to me,
these plants and, and he filed through,
[SPEAKER_00]: he showed me what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had, he had some pretty,
even today, cutting edge, uh, methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic growing, you know, and,
uh, he showed me everything and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and the stuff came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one came up just like his,
you know, it was really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a good teacher and taught the
number one thing he taught me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget was don't ever think,
you know, at all, always pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else who's doing, you know,
who's willing to tell you anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what their skill level is,
no matter how long they're doing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: always, always try to keep learning
because once the minute you think you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got all figured out is the minute that
when you, you'll have a problem and you
[SPEAKER_00]: won't have any idea what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, I got the books and started
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so he always told me,
he told me when he gives me the Kim dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: he says, all right, and you know,
he never, he only, he always had like a
[SPEAKER_00]: very small amount of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never had like, like I said,
he would sell me a quarter pound of head
[SPEAKER_00]: stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would all be super scum, you know,
all the tops, the best buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would, and then he would like
smoke a few joints and give me a nug of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the, always the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never had like an ounce or two of it
or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked him, I was like, what's the
deal with that, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best one, clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a killer, you know,
all the streams he had and he had some
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, dude, it's, it's a bitch to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't root, you know, with a stick
heavy accent, it won't root, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't count on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I was like, whatever,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, I was like, in other words,
he was like, you don't really want this
[SPEAKER_00]: when he gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you don't really want this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have it, but I know you're not
going to be able to do much with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause I can't really do a whole bunch
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it was like that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, whatever, dude,
that's the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he gives it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one was a, was a crop of
super skunk or a hundred percent super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that little Hermi one that he gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, and then the next one I was
going to, you know, take a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother going pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me, he goes, Hey man,
I'm telling you right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's better to stick with that super skunk
at roots in 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's got a quick bed,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, I'm just going to give it
a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's the worst thing that
happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a bunch of cuttings out of it
and it sure enough, it rooted in like 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Hmm, so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, what he told me is not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing he told me, I'll never
forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the Kim dog is for the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes in his heavy accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, and never smoke in a bubbler
before 11 AM.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the guy who like, like this guy
just smokes joint after joint after joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is advice to me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I probably pulled out a bubble right
then loaded it up and smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably before 11 AM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so, and it came out really
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I, I did, I grew it and it came
out really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right, you know,
the super skunk is definitely a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: Yoder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was very important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so I'll just have a few of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the years went by and you know,
that's the way it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, you know, we,
we weren't very connected back then
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was very sparse and sporadic
and unusual and rare when you would get a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to like trade things with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the other thing he told me,
I should say was never, ever, ever give
[SPEAKER_00]: this to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving this to you and I shouldn't be,
you know, I'm, I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm giving this to you,
I'm violating my friend's trust to me not
[SPEAKER_00]: to give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, don't do that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever give this to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right, yeah,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my word, my word is my honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the years went by, you know,
kids came and you know, life was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: settled down and you know, life was really
different when Jerry died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of adjustment for
people like me and just kept on growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the killer and trying to learn as I was
going along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2005, fast forward 2005,
I looked at a high times article that a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, you won't believe this,
but this guy, okay, so let me back up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a fellow on tour who we became
friends through the pot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like talking about this, but talking about
that, but showing each other buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: we find, you know, like, you know,
connoisseur type things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he became a good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started talking to me about
coincidentally, you know, before Jerry
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started talking to me about this pot
chem dog, you know, uh, that he would grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that he, that he would, uh, smoke when he
was young, you know, the same kind of way
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the super scone,
but up in New Hampshire and Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_00]: area where he's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it kind of went in one
ear and went out there at the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, out the other at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we became really good friends and
even better friends, um, after Jerry died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's actually still really one of my
closest friends to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, um, yeah, let's see how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I started, like when Jerry died,
there was a big disconnect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we lost contact with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we didn't have cell phones
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a minute, for, you know,
a year it was, it was like, it took a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute to get ahold of everybody and find
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there was no events going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the next thing didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just took a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I linked back up with this fella who
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he, um, I had the chem dog now
and I smothered him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked it with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, dude, this is the fucking
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you smoked this when you were young,
you were always told me about your friend
[SPEAKER_00]: G and I was because he knew G I guess,
you know, I mean, I, I know he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were real close actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, back when I guess they,
they met at a fish show or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, back in the early nineties
and or late eighties and had become good
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, you know, uh, he lived up in
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he moved up to Tahoe and I'd go up
there and visit him, go snowboarding and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he started a little thing
and he, you know, I gave him the chem,
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him the chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm figuring, Hey, you know, the guy who
cracked the seed is he told me the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, my friend cracked the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the 13 or the 12, whatever the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he started telling me his
story and I'm like, wow, that's what a
[SPEAKER_00]: coincidence that I actually ended up with
this cutting, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so then I guess G at one point
made these t-shirts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he made a super skunk and a chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like this light green,
almost the color of the chem dog shirt and
[SPEAKER_00]: had that this dog with the joint smoke,
uh, this dog on the back smoking a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: this little emblem he made for chem dog
and said chem dogs since 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had a super skunk and it
said super skunk since 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's when he got it, you know,
and they were kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and so one day I go up there to
go snowboarding and my friend gives me
[SPEAKER_00]: this, uh, chem dog shirt and a super skunk
shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you make these?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, my friend G made these back
East and, and, uh, he sent me a few and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, he's like, you got to have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, man, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still got to this day, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so that was probably like in
1998, 97, when that was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fast forward now to 2006,
2005, I see this high times article and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a, it's a interview of G talking
about the chem dog, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had actually gone into his garden
or, and taken pictures of his plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like in five gallon, like home
Depot bucket type buckets, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, uh, really beautiful plants,
you know, and they were showing some
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of the sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they said was the chem dog,
but clearly to me, it was not the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, and then some Kim,
uh, something else that might've been the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem D, but it was definitely the sister,
the cyst they call it a sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my sister is actually the number
I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I gotta have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to my buddy, I was like,
and they talked, they were, they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude, I just saw this article
with your buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what do we got to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what, what, what, what can I do
for us to go out there and get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, I'm not sure he's even got
the chem dog anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could give him the chem dog back and
then, you know, maybe he'll trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I'm sure we'd probably talked
about going to get other strains before
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I, uh, uh, I was having a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, uh, I was the first time I'd ever
seen powdery mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, I had it on my plants and I,
and I was like, what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started like kind of searching,
you know, now we have computers now and
[SPEAKER_00]: cell phones and chip, but not likely still
not like we do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got on the computer and I started
like kind of trying to find out what I
[SPEAKER_00]: could find out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like someone said it's called mildew or
powder mildew or downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started, you know, trying to figure
this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, um, it led me to this website
called overgrow.com and, uh, it looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like a completely, it looked to me,
it looked like a fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a police trap or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I, all these people are anonymous
and they're sharing knowledge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was learning stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stay up late at night and looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so naturally I Google, I not Google,
but search chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy came up chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and I was looking through what
he was saying and I could tell,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit, this is this guy G this is my
buddy's friend right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the guy that I was looking at his
pictures last, you know, last month or
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever it was, you know, uh,
of this high times article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, I'm going to, I'm going to
reach out to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got that t-shirt that he made out and
I took a little picture of the emblem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you had to have like a, like a
avatar, just like you gotta have with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the things we use today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called myself skunk VA, you know,
super skunk Virginia had made sense.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I sent, and, and, you know,
the overgrow is a serious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, you know, now when you go into
those forums, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: assholes and know-it-alls and,
but people are really open and willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: share back that on overgrow, they were a
little bit more cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were converse with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to see pictures and stuff,
you know, they didn't want to just start
[SPEAKER_00]: talking with anybody about growing and
all, giving you all their little trade
[SPEAKER_00]: secrets or even asking you questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've put on a few pictures,
I saw, if you put a few pictures up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you could get a better
conversation going when people saw you
[SPEAKER_00]: were serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not joking around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got, you've got some,
you're growing some pot, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put some pictures up of chem dog and,
uh, and then I put that little avatar on
[SPEAKER_00]: there and immediately he like sends me
like one of them little, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like private messages is like,
Hey, where'd you get that shirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I just gave the first
letter of the, of our mutual friend and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, Oh, Oh, do you live up in Tahoe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, but you know, we've known
each other for, you know, 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sat and the other, he tells me,
he goes, I don't, I don't have the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I know you don't,
I saw that, you know, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but today's your lucky day because,
you know, so let's just, so let's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: base player for the great for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was getting, he was playing and
this was like in December of 2005 and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was playing in February, 2006 in New York,
like nine nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of just planned just like
almost just materialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, listen, I will come out there,
check out Phil and I'll bring you your
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, if you could just give me like
trade assists for me, the sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, we didn't,
it wasn't right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chit chatted for, you know,
like a week or two, a little bit and got
[SPEAKER_00]: to sort of make sure that we knew who we
were talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I'm sure he called my friend and
made sure that, you know, it may all lined
[SPEAKER_00]: up and it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I took a couple of chem dog
cuttings in New York, put them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plane with me and flew them out to New
York and got a place, the Soho sweets down
[SPEAKER_00]: in Soho.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the night I got there, the biggest
snowstorm they've had since like 1953 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 43 or something, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but it did delay our meeting and
we eventually met up and he brought me
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't give me the sister and I'm not
really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really got to never have still
this day, never talked to him about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, but he did bring me to Kim D,
you know, and then, and then to my
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise and to my joy, he actually
brought the super skunk, which we had lost
[SPEAKER_00]: out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had lost that like in 1997,
my buddy was getting a house inspection by
[SPEAKER_00]: the landlord and he had the one mother now
my friend from Staten Island in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy I was talking about earlier at the
work field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, um, he basically, uh, had this
plant in a box and it just didn't make it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the inspection, you know,
so we hadn't had it in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he gives that back to me and I was
really happy, you know, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was real school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, at this point, me and my
friend and Tahoe, his, our mutual friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: me and G's mutual friend, we had our own
place and we were, you know, we were,
[SPEAKER_00]: we grew the Kim D now we had to Kim D on
the West coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to me, it wasn't, it wasn't
like, it's not really my, I don't love the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim D as much as I think the public loves
that more of a Kim dog guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but, but nonetheless,
the super skunk was back and it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same exact cutting,
definitely at age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the super skunk got, that seed had
gotten cracked in 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually been around longer than
the Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it's still out there,
I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody who's got that
cutting anymore per se, but I definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is where the side story
goes off because the guy who cracked that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, that super skunk seed, in Virginia
back in 1988, he's one of my closest
[SPEAKER_00]: friends now, you know, and he was a
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I know it's a really, it's a really
special thing to me because, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's actually a Facebook story,
you know, like a Facebook modern day kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of computer store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I linked back up to him and I'm really
grateful to have that man back in my life
[SPEAKER_00]: because he, he was, he's older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's like an, uh, an elder to me
and I look up to him and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it's just really special, but it's
like, I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe the circles you think
you've come, you know, all the circles are
[SPEAKER_00]: all now complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, boom,
one day you got this whole other part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your past is back in your future,
back in your present and especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but, um, but the reason I was
jumping as cause he actually has not the
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk, but we, we now have back the
parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the super skunk was at, I didn't know
this until recently, but the super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: actually wasn't just a crack from Neville
seeds from the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a cross that he made with
super skunk and that he got, he'd actually
[SPEAKER_00]: croc took two super skunk season,
crossing together and did something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've been, I don't know the exact
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get quoted on that quite
yet because it was something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he has one of the parents to that
super skunk, which to me is, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll see what we can do with
that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, maybe we'll get back
into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to go back to the chem dog
for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you said that, um, you saw
immediately that, um, chem, sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: mass G didn't have the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, uh, what now is referred to as
the Joe brand cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this was, this was, this was before,
uh, you'd have to ask G about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I, I'm under the impression that this
would have been before they went back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, a hundred percent sure about
that, but it might, it might've been,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, link back up after their
original meeting back in deer Creek in 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it wasn't, it to me, it looked like it
might've been Kim D I'm not really sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was, but I can't really remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the high times or articles still
around, but I don't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just, I just noticed that
either there was a picture that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually Kim dog or also it could have
been, I, it was just conspicuously missing
[SPEAKER_00]: from all these photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might even been that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: My memory is a little foggy, but I
probably actually still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pictures are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the sister just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was going to say, so if we
were to compare, say the chem sister and
[SPEAKER_02]: the chem D and the chem four and the 91,
um, you kind of mentioned earlier that the
[SPEAKER_02]: 91 was your favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think it is then, for example,
that, um, people like JJ and Rez choose to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with the D, um, kind of as they're,
you know, to work those lines out over,
[SPEAKER_02]: say the 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my guess from what I can see is that I
think that, I mean, I'm going on a limiter
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that maybe they didn't have the 91,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have to say that's probably what
it was, you know, or they had that fake
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe brand 91, which, you know,
I knew even, I was even around when that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, I, that's my guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I also, it, maybe I'm so biased
that I have to come up with something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can't understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have the chem D, I think it's,
it's got its place in life, but it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so far different than the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is, you know, it's not,
to me, it's not even close to the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: not, not, not just the level of quality,
but the same type, like in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: ballpark, like comparable even,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, that fuel smell is really
different on the chem dog 91 compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem D to me, it's just, you could
totally be in love with one and not even
[SPEAKER_00]: care about the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I'm saying is maybe the,
it's just the opposite for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just see it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met P bud later in life here too,
lately, like do Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he mentioned that to me that
he likes the chem dog D better,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem D better than the chem dog too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's just, I'm so heavily
biased about chem dog that I love it so
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that maybe it's hard for you to
understand why that would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it kind of goes without saying,
cause you kind of alluded that you weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: fully aware, but I guess just to kind of
rule the story straight, when G did go
[SPEAKER_02]: down from all that res business,
were you aware that you were the only one
[SPEAKER_02]: with the 91 cutting or it wasn't until you
saw that high time story and then it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of dawned on you that you were the only
one who had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, I hadn't, I don't think I was the
only one with it because those like back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Staten Island crew, I got to hang
out with them at one point in Tahoe when
[SPEAKER_00]: they came to visit interesting crowd and
they, they, I think they had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they had some chem dog and
I have no idea what any of those guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: up to these days, but they definitely had
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never really felt like I was the only
one that had the chem dog during those
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really know what happened to
G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it wasn't like my buddy, even though
he was closer than it wasn't like he was
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting around, give me the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow by blow was going on that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was our only encounter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to my hotel, we hung out,
we traded some stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We going, if I had to do it over again,
we would have had a lot more to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't know how much, how much in
common we had with people and things and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but that's all, that's all we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the trade and I came back and
brought the chem D and the super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: back and, and I gave her two really
beautiful cuts of the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and he was just as happy as I
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the only reason I did that
thing on overgrow though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only reason is to try to get
that trade just to do what, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it seemed like an opportunity
for me to get some other genetics out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the west coast in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I, you know, that was the whole
reason I did it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm kind of an introverted
person when it comes to this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to break out of my shell and
step into the lights of saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would start like an internet
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like give myself a name and put
pictures of my garden on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like insane to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, to my perspective, that was the
most insane thing I could do, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: works, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never really went back over to
overgrow and I was, I wasn't blown away by
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem D and I still didn't have the
sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I was kind of had a little bad taste
in my mouth a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I think it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had all happened and it happened and,
and you know, we ended up having the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: D on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have that before and that was
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then it got spread all over
the west coast, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then overgrow of course got
shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the details of that story,
but I know overgrow got shut down and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the government shut them down and
they took their servers and all this other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just compounded my belief that,
Hey, you need to keep your business,
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff and certainly don't go to the
internet with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, 2012, I, uh, I had another problem
all of a sudden in my garden that I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, I had these plants that
look like they were being poisoned with
[SPEAKER_00]: salt water, you know, and I'm flushing
them and I'm looking through the,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the root balls with a microscope
and, you know, now I'm going back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's back six years later,
I'm back on the internet and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I Google like, you know, cannabis form
and, uh, you know, uh, what's the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of them popped up, but I went with
the, uh, what's the, yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give myself a name and I start up
the whole thing and I'm, I'm going through
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I'm looking through,
I'm looking through bugs and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm researching tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting way, way deep in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some pictures on there and,
uh, and I put basically the same pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: probably because I have a hard drive in my
vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of pictures,
but I got some of my favorite pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure I put my favorite ones on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, immediately like a hundred people
messaged me and they're like, where did
[SPEAKER_00]: you get those pictures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like kind of stern with me, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I took them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them from my hard drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, they're like, those are skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are skunk VAs pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you get those?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're like an imposter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm an imposter and they all
clicked back in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely forgot about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, like I had not really
thought about this overgrowth thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: years at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's went right into my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started talking to this one guy who
was clearly paying attention to the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog by talking, you know, telling me what
he knew about the story and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was repeating and he goes,
are you skunk V and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, that was, that's,
you know, I was on overgrowth skunk V and
[SPEAKER_00]: it all popped back in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it freaked me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When all these people started texting,
I was like, all right, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: messaging me on this thing, you know,
and, and, uh, it was kind of, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really surreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so anyways, um, ended up that I
had broad mites and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: had to go through that and learn that and,
you know, take the brunt on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could tell everybody else what I
learned about it and how to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, uh, anyways, that's kind of,
that's kind of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I met G and, you know,
now we're all kind of getting linked up
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really special thing to be part of,
you know, it and, uh, for me this year was
[SPEAKER_00]: the 21st year I've had it, the Kim dog
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, she's been in my care
every single day, every single one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up giving, I think I counted
on my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up giving it over these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up giving it to, uh, five people,
uh, several of those people, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of those people more than once,
a couple of those people a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of those people,
I gave it to it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason I ever gave it to
anybody, cause I took that very seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I, I, uh, I, you know,
I, I had friends question our friendship
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wouldn't give it to them at
times, but I, it wasn't anything because I
[SPEAKER_00]: told my friend, I never would,
you know, and then in the end that I'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that, that seemed kind of silly
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, but that's, that's really how
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I really felt that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I told my friend, I wouldn't,
I wouldn't, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the brewers, you know,
like from, from that 2006, up until like
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012 time, and even a little bit longer,
actually, I would say, even though it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still a couple of years ago, you know,
Kim dog was a, it was a muddy thing
[SPEAKER_00]: because no one had the Kim dog and
everyone had the Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get cuttings of it, but none of
it was Kim dog, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I spent, I spent, I spent summer 2008
going from garden to garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people would call me up,
Hey man, you know, friends would call me
[SPEAKER_00]: up and say, Hey man, I, I, I'm running the
Kim dog out here on my property in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendoza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really looking like it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need you to come up and check it out
and go up there and see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a giant forest of giant outdoor 150
outdoor plants, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and having to tell them, say, no,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this isn't the sour diesel,
but it looks a lot like the sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's definitely not the Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, turns out that that was that,
that Joe B thing that happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that whole mix up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I have, I have the whole details on
how that happened because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my, my good friend was there and,
uh, and it was a big mix up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and, but I, I think I'd rather
leave that out of it because I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: really talked to him and see how much he
wants people to know about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how that happened and stuff like that and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just leave that out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but that's what, that's what,
as I understand, and according to him and
[SPEAKER_00]: he knows, he knows who he gave it to and
what the mix up was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and he knows how that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that was that Joe B cut of Kim
dog that was out here and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that 2007, 2006 or seven or eight era
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so, uh, but, but what I'm saying
is, is like, so you might, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as someone who loves Kim dog and you're
growing it, you know, trying to get by in
[SPEAKER_00]: life and stuff, you know, you're like,
Hey, I've got some Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be interested in looking at
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whoever it was would eventually
got to the point where people didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at it because they had already
seen it and they didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they never saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It got so bad sometimes where I would show
it to people, you know, finally say,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, this is Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in their mind, they'd already made up
their mind about what they thought Kim dog
[SPEAKER_00]: was and their, and their opinion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would just brush it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, this is killer pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you, what's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for like four years, I thought I was
the only one who liked Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my couple of friends, you know,
and then recently because of the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or because breeding is becoming,
you know, a more prevalent thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, maybe the Kim dog is making
its comeback now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are more willing to stop and
pay attention to the, to the deal with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim dog and you know, how, how,
what it's, it's such the backbone of
[SPEAKER_00]: contemporary cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think in the world now,
I mean, I live here in California and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it definitely is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every strain that you see has got
something to do with Kim dog at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point, you know, and, and then,
you know, in 2003 I had a short lived
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership with a person and here in
Sonoma County and, and this person had
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the first time I'd seen sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, good Lord, this stuff smells
familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it has all of my
favorites in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to find out most likely, you know,
as the story goes some point back then,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those guys in Staten Island,
somehow, I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard so many different
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I wasn't there, but somehow
some way, the super skunk that they got
[SPEAKER_00]: from my front of Virginia and that Kim dog
got tangled up in a, in a Hermi fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think that's how the sour
diesel came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, I think that, cause I mean,
clearly that's, it's not the, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gotta be the most, you know,
famed strain of weed on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was actually going to ask you,
do you ever feel like you kind of don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get any credit where you should for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was going to say, you know,
a lot of people don't realize that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, the sour D is the 91 to get thrown a
bit of pollen on the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like you should get some
credit for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think you're kind of too far
removed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when I think about it, both of those
strains are very much attributable to
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely are, but I would give,
I know this sounds like some hippie shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would give the Grateful Dead credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I said, I just, I would,
I just introduced some, a couple of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite growers to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally all I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did all the hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flew out, met each other,
you know, they did all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I'm not, I don't really want
credit, but, and I'm not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that there's another story
out there where they went to Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_00]: got some super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, maybe they had another super
skunk, who knows, you know, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely know that my, my friend from
New York, he, he definitely left a super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk behind with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like I said, I got that,
that they think that the sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I got that one, the super skunk from,
and actually he knew, she knew somehow he
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that that was the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: He somehow, he was kind of the one that
even told me, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That the super skunk that he was giving me
was the same one that he, that he got back
[SPEAKER_00]: then, which was the same as the mass
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says to you, I'm calling it the super
skunk, but they call it the mass skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then coming home, I grew it and sure
as shit, it was the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the little features were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, that pregnant belly,
the smell is unforgettable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's loud like the sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's unforgettable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it smells just like a stunk on the
road from about 150 yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's, it's, it's just
unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really want any kind of credit
for anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I would give Jerry Garcia
and the Grateful Dave credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause man, what are, what are,
what an amazing connection that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that those guys made and that
you make those trade because if they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do that and if he didn't bring the
Kim dog back out here, my friend from New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, he gave up on the Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I really was the only one in my
world had had it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I ended up giving it to
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I wanted to make sure I wasn't,
if something happened to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or my place, I didn't want anything that,
and I didn't want the, I understood the
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity of the situation that this could
go away forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always made sure that someone else
had it, you know, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it ended up being over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it to, I think five people total
and only really one of them ever really
[SPEAKER_00]: kept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's my, my good friend who I knew
from Tahoe, like I was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say, so when we see
breeders these days, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: notably we've got Bodhi and also Swerve of
the Cali con claiming to be breeding with
[SPEAKER_02]: the skunk VA cutting that, I mean,
I guess you've kind of already alluded to
[SPEAKER_02]: the answer that that they obviously not
getting it directly from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that when people see a
breeder claiming to be breeding with the
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk VA cutting, they should kind of view
that with an eye of caution, or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's probably legit?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just come through someone through
someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that, you know, the way I look at
it is like this, cause you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could go and you could, you could get
into this tit for tat with this and it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the truth matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe that I believe that what
you say and the truth, it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should line up, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your story is, is that you did some
stupid little shady deal in the back room
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the cuts that you have or whatever
it is, you know, you know, that's your
[SPEAKER_00]: story, you know, stick, you gotta,
you gotta go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come out at some point,
you know, and, and the way I look at it is
[SPEAKER_00]: this, is that as we go forward,
I do think it matters because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at some point we're all going to
be completely, I believe this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that all of us here in the
United States, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely, you know, out in the open and
you're going to have your story,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how did this happen to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why did you choose to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you choose to risk your freedom to
do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then what are the details?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like prohibition is ending
and it's taken a while for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I gotta say back when, you know,
I turned on the lights for the first time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I never ever thought we would
get this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thing's going quicker than any of
us thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if your story's a lie,
then you're going to have to, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to, you're going to have to deal
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not anything for me to have a big
opinion about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to deal with that if
that's what's going on in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not you, of course, but whoever,
you know, I kept it above the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, and like I did my part,
you know, the thing that people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize, I think in this, you know,
world of marijuana growing consultants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we live in, and that's a joke is
that, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't, we don't, we don't, this plant's
not doing this for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we're not, we're not the
stars of the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the, we're tools and a toolbox for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant doesn't have eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant doesn't have feet for certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the plant, it needs protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason cannabis, in my opinion,
has evolved so quickly in the last 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years, 30 years is because, you know,
it's speaking to people and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing what we're being told,
you know, we're following the,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're following what we need to happen to
make A and B happen, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: make the thing happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant thanks us for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we work for the plant,
you know, that's, that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the Kim dog needed somebody,
Kim dogs, a powerful plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend from New York, he used to tell
me, I don't know, man, he used to say to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I think it's tied into the stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause sometimes he'd have really good
luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would just like, this guy was
skilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made, he grew the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it didn't work out with him,
the Kim dog, just like for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes like, what the hell
happened here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not going like it did the
last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finicky a little bit, you know,
and he used to tell him, he used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced that this is a very like,
you know, mechanically minded,
[SPEAKER_00]: like nuts and bolts kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was telling me, I think it's lined up
with the stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would look at him like, what are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, it's, you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gonna, I think it has a lot to do
with the star alignments and the moons and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycles of the youth, the galaxy and
the solar system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's affecting the Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, dude, you sound like,
you sound like you're on drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but that's kind of how it is
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, it's a very, very powerful
plant and it's, it found its safe havens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did, you know, I'll tell, I'll share a
little story with you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, uh, um, you know, like the Kim dog,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's, it's being grown at house
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep this like non-personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown in house set, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, and then, and then the
guy who's in house, he has like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he's hasn't seen a lot of his
friends for years, or maybe he hasn't seen
[SPEAKER_00]: some key friends in some years,
you know, like life gets busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they randomly bump into each
other, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At like, uh, uh, at one of those cannabis
cups, the Emerald cup, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Sonoma County, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they reconnect, change phone numbers,
you know, phone numbers are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you lose connect with
people, especially if they're not on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, Hey man, I don't have the
chem dog person.
[SPEAKER_00]: B says the person, a, can you give it back
to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on over as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have cuttings for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So person becomes a person, a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets the plant from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then person, a gets arrested a week
later and they kill all this chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a true story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's magic to me, you know,
that plant had some sort of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, this is some hippie shit,
but in my opinion, that plant had some
[SPEAKER_00]: forward thought of what was getting ready
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, some way, somehow cosmically,
it found itself out of a bad situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a true story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was a recent story that
happened that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, so what I'm trying
to say is I think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be more humble when we talk
about our contributions to this and just
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that we're, we're just part of
the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just part of the toolbox that this
plant's using.
[SPEAKER_00]: To evolve because, you know, cannabis,
cannabis uses, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody uses cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they got president Obama's kid on
film the other day, smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's a big cannabis to me is
in the relationship it has to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a, you know, we live in a
stressful world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're polluting ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we've got, we're bombarded with
negative news and bad media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, it's just a weird
world we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think planet earth is an amazing
place, but we got our challenges here and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put food on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that cannabis really truly
helps people get through that,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond now we're, now we're doing
cancer research with it and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing research in all times,
all the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's a big part of our
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the, and as we look back in
history, many years from now, say 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40, 50 years, we're going to, I think
society is going to recognize that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this plant, you know, evolved quickly
at the right time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it become a useful tool for us in
the world that we're creating for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who, the people who are doing
the things, say me and G, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting the guy in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some, that's some grateful dead
shit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting a guy in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, 25 years later,
we're sitting here talking about chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing, you know, but I think the
plant is the motivator and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, it's like any symbiotic
relationship in nature or in the universe
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, one organism needs the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does what it needs to help that
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That organism benefits from that aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it returns the favor back to the,
you know, in this sense, the caretaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just keeps going around and around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in that process, and it's an
evolution of, of, of two organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming better beings because of that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what our, you know,
but to answer your question, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't, I, I don't know those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met those people before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't, I don't know what their
motive is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're doing,
but I do know that at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're all sitting around the table
and this war is finally over, we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have stories and some of them are
going to be a lot more interesting than
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can tell you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 91 cutting, over the 21 years
you've had it, do you think kind of on
[SPEAKER_02]: that same theme of evolution we were just
talking about, do you think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypically kind of changed at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I guess kind of when you took it
back to G, was it just like, he just
[SPEAKER_02]: instantly recognized it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it had, it had kind of
changed just a little bit over the years
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you took it back, like he knew it
was the 91, but it was just a little
[SPEAKER_02]: different when he had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it was the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I think that I would agree
that there's definitely been some genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: drift over the years a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely some traits that have
waned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug traits, as Duke would call them,
I like that phrase, I stick with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the drug traits have not changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're as strong as they ever were.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor trait has definitely taken back
a step over the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes I've noticed, because like
I said, there was other cuttings out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are one by one every now and
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many there were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly there wasn't very many,
but every now and again you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, that's the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll smoke it and you go,
that does not taste like the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the one I got, the one I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually, it's something I'm really
interested in right now is what we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: about that to slow that process down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even hopefully repair that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm working on that right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did some digging around on your
Instagram and it was approximately 63
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked you, were you going to
release the chem dog to the public in seed
[SPEAKER_02]: form?
[SPEAKER_02]: And your reply was, I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to tell us a little more about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got a company, it's called
Lucky Dog Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm in the process of
basically what I'm doing is I'm developing
[SPEAKER_00]: a male that I feel represents the chem dog
and that I can breed with and make hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every now and again release some
back crosses with itself, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had a lot of luck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten, I think, you know,
a project like that, if you really do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most brewers would tell you that
could take 10 years, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about testing that I've
learned, because this is new to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really done a lot of breeding
before, but it's going really well and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a little, like, kindness come
back to me in seed form from some things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it, I gave the cut to someone many
years ago on just a wimp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, so when I said only one person
ever did anything with it, I got to back
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be two people, because he
definitely, he was breeding and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to me about breeding and he was
like one on mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 2004, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him a cut of the Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, let's see, three years ago,
two years ago, we ran back into each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost contact and he actually gave me
some seeds that he'd worked with that cut
[SPEAKER_00]: of Kim dog I gave him and had some good
success with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me some stuff back that I can
get going with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually, it actually was,
was really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me, gave me a good head start on
what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of cool to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, it was kind of cool because
I, I never expected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was just, I knew he was going to
do something good with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, a bunch of handful 10,
10 years later, he gives them back to some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, it's turning out to be
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I don't want to put anything out
there that I don't 100 for fully percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stand behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, but I feel like,
I feel like by the beginning of this next
[SPEAKER_00]: year, we're going to have something going
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we don't want to just have two or
three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have a nice mail that I can make
a bunch of hybrids with, with some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite strains and then, you know,
give that to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so that's where that's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually kind of leading into the
next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say it's kind of a
two-parter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I noticed you had those seeds,
which were, I think you said you used a
[SPEAKER_02]: silverback OG mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if we think about res dogs work and
JJ's work, they use the Hindu Kush and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani respectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is the ideal match?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I look at that, um, I would agree
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I feel like I'm doing the same
thing in the sense that the, in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, the OG cush is, is a,
um, is an Afganica type of strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the chem dog is it's a clearly,
I think it's a high elevation,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, cooler nights, a lot more used to
withstand like a lot more UV light than a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the lower land strains would be,
um, something that grew at a high
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation, you know, the very bright sun
with a lot less protection, making its own
[SPEAKER_00]: protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where those Afganica
strands, that's where they get that glossy
[SPEAKER_00]: dark green leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a, I think it's protection on
the, uh, the, their, their natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that they came from,
where they were exposed to extremely hot
[SPEAKER_00]: days, definitely not hot days and
certainly some cool nights, but also some
[SPEAKER_00]: very intense sunlight, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I would say that I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I think that OG Kush falls into
that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's clearly an Afganica,
you know, Kush strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I think that that's a good
place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is kind of what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working, um, I took a back cross,
uh, OG cross, OG Kush back cross that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's what I'm working on
developing this mail with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so like I said, uh, just released,
uh, well just named a strain, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's called chem crush with a K and it,
it's, it's a nice, um, marriage of OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: and chem by what heavy, heavy chem flavor
and smell to it, you know, and very
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky, it's beautiful pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got that gloss on the,
on the families that I was looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and to back up a little bit,
it's actually the silverback of OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the silver chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from an IC collective here in
Oakland in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a plant that that's a strain they
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that was a chem dog, feminized cross
with a silverback OG, which I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen the silverback OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, the, that's what that's
silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver chem is it's a, it's a,
it's just a one single plant, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: from some feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend made the IC collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you did, I get this male,
what would be some of the other clone
[SPEAKER_02]: onlys you'd want to mate it with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what are some of your favorite clone
onlys we kind of haven't talked about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, it's not very, it's not very,
um, I don't have a lot of favorites,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I really only smoke chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke that my new one is my favorite
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem crush has turned.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been smoking all summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but after that it's chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I I'm going to
experiment with crossing with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these feminized seeds, like, uh,
taking some, like for this instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: the silver chem, and then there's another
one called the chem scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I'm going to be really reserved
and cautious with that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I want, I don't going to be worried
about Hermes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't see any Hermes on those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm learning as I'm going here and I
understand that the community is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is concerned about, uh, you know,
feminized seeds in that regard,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so, but that, and then,
um, um, you know, the ultimate goal really
[SPEAKER_00]: is to get the back cross, the chem dog
back cross in the seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I'm shooting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can release that to the public and
say this for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my is Kim dog, you know, whatever it
ends up being a back cross, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came from a chem dog,
91 cut for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question mark about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no weird story behind it where
you're going to find out later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what the public is would
like to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I think certainly by the time I
get this thing where I want it to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be the demand,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, to, to name off a
bunch of strains, I have a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really know where I'm going to
go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I can't really tell you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the, um, kind of the inspiration to
start all of this, did that kind of get
[SPEAKER_02]: lit up when you kind of noticed that,
um, some of the older people from the
[SPEAKER_02]: overgrown forums, for example,
were getting more active in the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, we've seen Oregon kid
and Mr. Soul, they're both getting things
[SPEAKER_02]: slash have gotten things back underway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that kind of a bit of a catalyst for
you to think like now's the time for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: get my head in the seed game?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's interesting
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, the possibilities are endless
and I, I see that it kind of clicked with
[SPEAKER_00]: me and, uh, you know, I just feel like
that it's, it's just the next step for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I can contribute back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and that's what I want to do,
you know, and, and I, I, I feel like I've,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I can, I got the growing of
cannabis down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's like a machine,
you know, it's just like, there's not much
[SPEAKER_00]: more I can do to tweak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, of course there's always going to
be some new things that come along,
[SPEAKER_00]: new technologies, I would guess,
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, there's really not much room for
me to grow in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting what I want from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and I just want to take it to the
next step and see what I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got the tools and like I
said, you know, I, I, after, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of years after two decades of
doing this, I can see when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is leading me in a direction,
you know, and, uh, and I've gotten,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten the signs that that's where
this is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just kind of going with the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, I feel like genetics,
when I was a kid in the early eighties,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like genetics, the old school
genetics, I feel like they were in some
[SPEAKER_00]: ways a lot better than what we have these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that's perception
necessarily, but that definitely is my
[SPEAKER_00]: perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't know if that's all it is,
but I would like to get things more
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's what I want my
contribution to do it to be, is to get
[SPEAKER_00]: things more isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, w you know,
when people in, you know, whatever people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next state that legalizes wants to
grow their six plants or whatever their
[SPEAKER_00]: big brother allows them to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be able to like,
not have to spend 20 years or 10 years or
[SPEAKER_00]: five years trying to find what they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they should be able to get what
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they should be, they,
they know what they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like OG Gush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they want to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what they're looking for,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I would like to try to get that
to the point where we're isolating things
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to get those skunks back,
those skunk smells back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that we're really,
there's big notes when I feel like someone
[SPEAKER_00]: shows me what they are talking about skunk
and I'm using the skunk as an example,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think that we all, when we were
young, I think that was all, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: our favorite weed that we kind buds that
we fell in love with, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but I don't smell that
specifically anymore when I smell it,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm out in the world checking to
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beautiful pot, not saying it's not
great strains, super high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think that we need to isolate
those flavors and those smells back out so
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't lose them forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, and if, if you work hard enough,
I think, and if you go through enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I think you can isolate and a lot of
luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned, I think that you can isolate
those traits back and we can, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: reintroduce them back to the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if people want to get a muddy
back up again, that's their, that's their
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think that somewhere it
needs to be, you know, in other words,
[SPEAKER_00]: like taking those memories I have of that
mouthwatering cannabis that I haven't seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in a while, not to say, like I said,
that we don't have a lot of great things
[SPEAKER_00]: these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause man, people are making some amazing
things I've seen, but getting those things
[SPEAKER_00]: and isolating them back to where,
you know, we can kind of reset the button
[SPEAKER_00]: and start over and start working them
again and see what we can do when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not, you know, hiding in our basements,
you know, from, from the big brother,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and each other even,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, that's kind of my vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I have, I'm hoping that's my,
I can, my next step can be in this,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this, in this, in this process,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, as someone from Australia,
who's in that position of where big
[SPEAKER_02]: brother is kind of looking at the
possibility of letting us do some things,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's definitely great to be able to
have people like you who are looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of get things back to kind of their
true breeding forms in that same kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of how things were better in the
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we go back to kind of the, the super
skunk and where it originated from the
[SPEAKER_02]: SSC, do you think that like breeding was
so much better back then that like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the clone that is now, that was the super
skunk, that was just kind of a common
[SPEAKER_02]: occurrence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you got a couple packs of SSC,
you would likely find something that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it was like a one in a
million thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these days to get a clone only,
it's considered like one in a million,
[SPEAKER_02]: but back in the day, people talk of SSC,
for example, as though like it was just a
[SPEAKER_02]: common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, well, I, what my take on it
is, is that when the man traveled around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world and he collected all this stuff
for our enjoyment to, to, to make his
[SPEAKER_00]: business and to break that catwalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what he, what he was finding was
what evolution, you know, God knows the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I, the way I kind of, the way I look
at what helps me kind of put it in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a visual picture is imagine going to
Afghanistan, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and during, by the way, not to
mention during the, the, the you at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Soviet invasion and teaming in,
you know, kind of be friended like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, guys who are hiding in a
mountain or like their life is war and
[SPEAKER_00]: their families are producing hash and
cannabis to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are doing breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're breeding up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making seeds for every year,
just like farmers have been doing for
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow this man, you know,
befriends these people to a point where he
[SPEAKER_00]: takes them to their village, to their
homes and to their staff spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've given things to take out into
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I think that maybe just by
default, I think that the, the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: were, you know, we're all these original
Landry strange or whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the, the, the people who were
caretaking informed for God knows how long
[SPEAKER_00]: their families have been taking care of
them for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe who knows, you know, for as long as
you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I went to Ireland once I went to
the Guinness factory and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they showed us the base where they,
the, I'm sorry, the, uh, the safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they keep their, uh, their yeast
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a starter and they have the same
one going back to the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Guinness brewery or to the last fire or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they keep it under safekeeping,
you know, and it's built their business
[SPEAKER_00]: and their, you know, people all over the
world drink Guinness beer for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it all comes from that strain of
yeast that they have there at their,
[SPEAKER_00]: at their facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis went through the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't have the benefits of,
of, uh, safes in Dublin, Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the benefits of, you know,
maybe arm, you know, dudes, not
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan who, you know, we're trying to
keep their families fed and do something
[SPEAKER_00]: that their fathers or mothers showed them
and grandfathers or mothers showed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that breeding, that had been
done, it was just done differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like on this fast paced thing,
like trying everything you can and hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: that you catch the right thing that we're
kind of caught up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more of like, you know,
this, this village and family was isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: from this family and the Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they just never crossed their
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just did the families were working on
their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe they had products that
their own, that whatever, whoever was
[SPEAKER_00]: working, whether it consumed themselves or
selling it more likely and making hash
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and selling it more likely,
you know, they were looking for traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were breeding, you know,
just like humans have learned how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I think that when the world got
smaller and everything got moved around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think we did what we would
normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would try to take two of our favorite
things and cross them together and make
[SPEAKER_00]: something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results have been, you know,
they've been kind of hit or miss a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: myths, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, you know, when,
when, when I was young and throughout my
[SPEAKER_00]: life, you know, I've, I've smelled
cannabis and tasted cannabis and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that I fell in love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's imprinted in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's imprinted in my brain, just like
every other, you know, pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I'm, I, I have those,
those things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I come across, like I talked about
the Beatrix choice earlier, I actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: that friend that I'd be friended,
uh, that I ran back into in life lately,
[SPEAKER_00]: he actually gave that back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just took it down for the first
time and I'm trying to, now I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: through files in my memory from 1992 was
the last time I smoked that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got a sack of it as I was
going up to Buffalo, New York to summer
[SPEAKER_00]: tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the last sack of it I ever got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my favorite, my favorite weed when
I was a kid growing up in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm just sitting here going,
is it it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smelling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it and it's got like a
heavy grape, like artificial grape
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: To it, which I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, um, it just makes my mouth water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't smoked yet because it's
drying right now, but I'm smelling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I sure as shit smoke great
bubble gum in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure as shit do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it doesn't look like it to me,
but my memory of what it looked like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have a very, uh, you know,
developed memory that I have a more
[SPEAKER_00]: developed memory of the flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an example I'm talking
about is taking those, those memories,
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits where I formed the opinion
that yeah, that was better than what we
[SPEAKER_00]: got today and trying to like recreate
that, you know, just based off of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what, that's all I got,
you know, I don't know if it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the world, I mean, you,
you'll have to tell me, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm keen to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be sure to let you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so did you ever happen to,
uh, have any run-ins with the infamous
[SPEAKER_02]: roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Duke, do we call him Duke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what we like to call?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he, he's been talking to me about the
roadkill skunk and I never really heard
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone call anything particular growing up
in Virginia, the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we had like skunk number one and then
we have what they called the basic five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I recall that was the heavy skunk one,
the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the Northern lights,
which.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Northern lights to me, if I had to say
the chem, like people will compare the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog to the OG Kush in other ways and
say they must be related.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I see, I don't get the
impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a direct relationship between the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my buddy swears to God that the OG
Kush came from a bag of my, like a bag
[SPEAKER_00]: sheet out of one of my units years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I laugh at him every time I hear that,
but I don't, I just don't, I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that, that they're that connected,
but this Northern lights that I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke that came out from the catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I want to say Northern lights number
five, but I don't really know if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just called it Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had that same color as the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's had that loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like molecule penetrating smell that the
chem dog has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever, whenever, when I first smoked
the chem dog, I immediately that memory of
[SPEAKER_00]: that Northern lights popped up,
you know, that we used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so, you know, I had that same
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know where I was going with
that, but, uh, um, what was your question
[SPEAKER_00]: again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever get to run across the
roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I never actually ran anything
called the roadkill skunk in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do kind of turn me onto that,
that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he talks much about it and he's
told me a lot about it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, the skunks when I was a kid,
the super skunk was at the very top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: list mainly because you had more exposure
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right after that, if you were
lucky, the basic skunk or the,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the skunk five, I think is what they
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and then there was a skunk number
one, which was similar to the basic five
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, but those were pretty much
the skunk strains when I was that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been, uh, that I've been around exposed
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we keep with that same theme of like
kind of comparing some of the older
[SPEAKER_02]: strains to some of the new ones,
um, on your Instagram, there was a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: frosty looking photo of some girl scout
cookies, but one of the hashtags you used
[SPEAKER_02]: was hashtag yawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this kind of a bit of a, of a reference
to how you feel about some of the new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains versus the older ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they stand up or the old ones just
crush them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I think that I don't
understand how the girl scout cookie got
[SPEAKER_00]: so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't want it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've peaked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it and I've peaked it out,
you know, and my friend at IC collective,
[SPEAKER_00]: he made the, uh, the chem scout,
which it got really popular really quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially around the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he won a couple of it and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that one better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it has Kim dog in it,
but it's really, really much more similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to the girl scout with just a lot more,
just a, uh, I want to say a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a couple more notes of odor to it
and flavor too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, uh, I just never was impressed
with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt I'm like, I think I'm sure,
you know, it is like when it hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: streets here in California, it just was
like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, you know, you were selling
units, someone would, could be so units
[SPEAKER_00]: like on the wholesale market for say in
California here, they're getting like 22
[SPEAKER_00]: to 26, but they, there was a period a
couple of years ago for two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: even where the girl scout was on that same
market going for 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, I can't wait to see
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause people show you strains,
you know, and you're like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you pull out of the sack of Kim
dog and they're like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're like, wow, that's like
10 times better than this or it's just so
[SPEAKER_00]: much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, so I couldn't
wait to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to be honest, I was disappointed
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not, it's not my, it's not that
I don't think it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think it's great for the
daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got, you know, business meetings or
whatever people do in the daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that, uh, I don't,
where's the taste, where's the smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm missing something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like I've made up traits
to justify keeping it in my life,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, uh, that's, that's not what
I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great, great example,
you know, but yeah, that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, whatever, you know,
I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not, but everyone's got
their own, I respect and understand and
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly seen that everyone's got their own
opinions about these things and blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I mean, I'm not going to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, I got so much space in my lungs for
smoke in my lifetime here, however long I
[SPEAKER_00]: get to be here and I'm not going to waste
it on weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a good taste to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause half the reason I smoke weed is the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really demanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main thing I get out of it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess just to be fair, um,
what would you say are some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: downsides of the 91 then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've already brought up that she's,
you know, she's inconsistent and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one thing that's commonly brought up
is she harms, you know, cause a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: famous strains are born from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How easy is she to actually harm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is she like any other strain where like
you do need to actually stress or is she
[SPEAKER_02]: quite temperamental?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that, like I said,
the first time I grew, it was in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think the first bit I smoked
was, uh, the first, first week in January,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first week in January of 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found a seat in there and it was,
there was no seat in the super scunt,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a seat in the, uh,
in the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, when I say a seat, I'm saying
like, that was like one or two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very, and it was shocking to me
because I was learning at the time and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, oh my God, what did I do wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, he explained to me everything about
how Hermes happened, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we knew at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went through my whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I got a lay leak in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have enough air flows or are we
choking in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, I think I had, I think I had
seeds in every single, and I'm saying
[SPEAKER_00]: like, say you had five pounds of weed,
you'd find five seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very, and then every now and again,
you would see one bud that would have just
[SPEAKER_00]: be, I would say four seeds, but relatively
speaking, you know, 10 seeds in a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, holy shit, what happened
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start, you know, going
through the whole thing and seeing where
[SPEAKER_00]: else they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you never find another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I usually don't ever see the
males, the, the Hermi flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, it's very rare that I actually see the
Hermi flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually I see a seed, which I'm
assuming it must've been a flower at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point, but I've tried to go through and
see if I could find them to pick them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've certainly found them in like
dried flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely a few times I've found
them in there, but it must happen real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and they must go away real quick
because it's really hard to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've, I've scoured them,
but, uh, the down points on the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, you could get that,
I don't know, that's depends, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, if you get up in the
morning and you smoke chem dog rosin or
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs all day, you know, you're going to,
you're going to have it's for me
[SPEAKER_00]: personally, that's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they had to have a life and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had lots of patients tell me that
it's, you know, people consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cause they want to, uh, the wasting away
syndrome or they're having a heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just are stressful and they're
having, you know, a lot of people when
[SPEAKER_00]: they get stressed out, they can't eat,
they lose their appetite and they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis helps them with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had lots of patients over the years
tell me that not only did this chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: help with their appetite, but they really
felt that it changed their metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they were able to put more weight
on without eating much more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That their body's metabolism changed where
it actually was converting energy to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I don't know that I don't
want to say that's a negative,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a, that's, that's not
recreational, you know, when you,
[SPEAKER_00]: when people are, you know, feeling a
little heavy on the front because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking too much chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, as far as the traits of the
planet cell for the buds go, she looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like a bitch to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say that it,
you know, if you get it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's the worst thing I don't like is
the Fox tail thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing that more the last few years
than it used to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be more rounded than whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see one of those rounded buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get a picture of it, you know,
cause it's tough for some reason to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am like, I always think I figure out
what I can do to make it so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently all that rounded top,
which is just a lovely, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: visually it's just lovely when it turns
out like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I, I say that like, you know,
I've got it down to the point where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're minimal, but I don't
like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish that the one thing I've noticed
with the chem dog is that what it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: done is that the, it has this funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people will tell you, Oh,
the chem dogs done day 79.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let it go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when my friend gave it to me,
he told me that you can let it go forever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you should, you can't, you got to take
it at some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take it at day 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seemed like a pretty reasonable
thing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant can keep on getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peak, no one really knows where the
peak is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, now we know what the peak
is because we can test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it turns out the peak is
way sooner, way sooner as far as the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: levels and Oh, the, the white hairs,
you know, like, so what the chem dog will
[SPEAKER_00]: do is it'll look perfect on day 48,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look perfect, picture perfect,
but obviously that's not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not, you, you can take that and now
you got what 19% T and who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're not going to take it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to get a little closer to
the peak and you keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after day 48, it does a little
Fox tailing and then it puts out a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: new set of white hairs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bugs me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing I don't like about
the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really bugs me because, you know,
I would have a lot more pictures to share
[SPEAKER_00]: with the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can never get happy with them
because, well, cause I'm weird and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of weird about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to look, look perfect,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and, uh, I'm a control
freak for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every, I think every flower is a
control freak if that's what they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, cause that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but, but, uh, yeah, I don't like
that cause it did visually it's hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: but by the end of the whole thing,
I mean, and you dry it and you cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't have, I, I personally
haven't smoked anything better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stronger has a better flavor as she stands
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's my opinion, but that's
the way I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, the, and the other
thing is like, it's much harder to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: giant chunk nugs than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, certainly can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got 2.12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm allowed to say this,
but I just got 2.12 pounds per a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was not because I, you know,
it was growing trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because, you know, the buds were
chunky, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaped and they came out perfectly,
you know, sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when, and when you smoke
it, you know, like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my fiance, she smokes cannabis daily for
her, for whatever reason she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've got all kinds of weed
around here and that jar is always the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so she, she's not biased like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't talk to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She met me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she just, that's just her favorite one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I don't know to me it's
still, I, I, I hope that we have one day
[SPEAKER_00]: soon, just a catalog of strains that are
on that level in my perception,
[SPEAKER_00]: that caliber, you know, you know,
me and my buddy at IC collective,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were talking, we were saying is like,
are we the only people who really love the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dark or like what, you know,
cause it just seems like it's sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: like, are we in a bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we create a bubble where this is the
queen of all cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just what we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think the whole world agrees with
us and, and we're wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, would you agree that there has
seemingly been more success breeding the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog as a her me than as with a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know it's kind of early days,
but it seems like whenever the chem throws
[SPEAKER_02]: some pollen, whatever it hits turns to
gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas whenever you hit it with an act
hit, like for example, the 91 with a male
[SPEAKER_02]: is maybe not as consistently producing
really stellar clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the, the, the, I've been
around a, uh, pretty extensive chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: feminizing project and, you know,
feminizing the chem dog hitting so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains and they were all
winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I, I, I don't think that that's
how it normally pans out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, like I said, the silver
chem, the chem scout, the sky,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sky chem, I mean, that's the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it looks like to me, like,
you know, that has to be explored a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more in further, you know,
and I don't really, I don't, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm not the one to be able to
articulate the community's opinion on
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm, I, the jury's still out on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the thing I I'm wondering
what the, uh, cause I guess what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying is to me, my understanding of the
perception of feminized seeds is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: shaky thing where some people are like
against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people seem to be against it,
but I'm the same as you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really seen too many problems to
be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of the time people don't
want to face their own growing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, that is definitely,
you know, I I've seen when I first got to
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D for an example, you know,
I grew it, like I was doing things at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I was overfeeding my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just where I was at in my
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was the last person to,
uh, to use, uh, in my circles to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: use any kind of salt mixtures,
you know, in, uh, these spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I overdid it until I understood,
you know, where I think the sweet spot is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got shit tons of hermy flowers on my
Chem D, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't get any Hermes, you know,
I don't have any Hermes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, literally no Hermes on the
Chem D that I grew recently, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using it as an example that the
growing methods have a lot more to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: that than I think people realize or give
good credit for, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, like I said, you know, I've,
I've been around this, this project and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm watching it unfold and I'm watching
the seeds as they, I'm talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching it for three years now
and, and watching the seeds come out and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the chem scout did, we were
suspicious the chem scout was creating
[SPEAKER_00]: some hermy, but you know, the chem dog was
always in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that definitely, certainly for surely
puts, you know, some, some, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: hermy banana type flowers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I never saw one on the chem
scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and even then, even in that
case, we, when I was helping my friend get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bottom of things, we did find a
problem in his, in, in a section of his
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room that could have been causing
some extra stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a hotspot in the
corner that wasn't getting the proper air
[SPEAKER_00]: flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I, we, we know for sure that
can cause a plant to, uh, to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate itself, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I haven't seen it to me,
it's been like, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but, um, but, but I,
I think my approach, I'm going to do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, cause I think there's a lot
of promise there and I think you have way
[SPEAKER_00]: more control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that in some aspects you can,
you can actually go and get the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for a little quicker than,
than going through the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and so I'm going to do both
because I, I, my goal, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: is I want that male or those couple males
that, you know, it's like Genesis yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: where that, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where this is our base right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this point, everything either gets
better or it goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to, we're not going to vary
from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as I'm learning to breed and I'm,
and I'm learning, you know, I'm learning
[SPEAKER_00]: at what, I mean, really it's just knowing
the plan is I think is what breeding all
[SPEAKER_00]: does is knowing the plant and being able
to, at any point in the plant's life,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, stages in any stage of the plant's
life say, you know, I'm feeling like this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's got this trade or this trade or
that trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's really what a
good breeder can do really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, what else is,
what else are you really doing besides
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, in order for that to be
successful at that, you gotta really know
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta really know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just met it, but really know
it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for me, what I want to do is
take that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my favorite strain to chem dog and
put it in the seed form and, and see where
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes from there, but make hybrids and
eventually release back crosses with
[SPEAKER_00]: itself that are, you know, cubed to the
point where it's guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get what you want,
you know, or the variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess, uh, kind of my ultimate
question in regards to the 91 in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: both working and breeding with it is,
do you think for this plant specifically,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the answer might be a little
different for other plants, but do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think for the 91 working with it is more
of an art or a science?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it seems to not behave quite like
the regular plant in some aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think, do you think that,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that like it, um,
you can consistently get results from it
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you think it's, it's not the type of
thing where you can have your kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: playbook and know if I do this,
it'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's, it's a bit
unpredictable in some ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to think that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as my understanding of what I'm
actually doing, met whatever method I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using at that time, um, I tried different
things at different times too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't always do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I definitely feel like I've
gotten a, um, you know, a process that is
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed to produce what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have very much variation
anymore from crop to crop with ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, what my friend told me
about the hit or miss and the stars,
[SPEAKER_00]: it definitely was true, but as time went
on and my understanding I want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: skills, but I don't really know if that
word applies to what I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those, you know, learning from my
experiences and applying what I'm learning
[SPEAKER_00]: to what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that just, that kind of went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very consistent now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, like I said, you know,
I had these new ones, the ChemCrush,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, uh, you know, a sour band in there,
which is really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the Beatrix Choice and some
Silver Chem on one side, say half that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then on the other half had ChemDog and I
crushed it on the ChemDog side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got more of a yield on the
ChemDog side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got, you know, it's always
better pot to me, so I'm not even going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that, but you know, it's very
consistent, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tricky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, you know, the nuts and bolts of
it, it consumes itself at the end of its
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to let it do that because
that's what it's going to do anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, time is of the essence and
you know, this is just the clock of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but it's hard to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it, it consumes itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it takes every little bit of its
nutrient out of its body and eats it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and you can watch it do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, you know, if you're the first
time you ever come walking into a growing
[SPEAKER_00]: room, you're going to go and without using
your nose, okay, you're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell happened to those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these over here, they're all
Russian green and stuff, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ChemDog is just, you know,
for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does do that more than you used to
going back to that question you asked
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier about the changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does do that more like, uh,
the best ChemDog I ever grew was organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason that was,
was because you're never ever really just
[SPEAKER_00]: running on water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're doing it that with
the method I use with that, I always had
[SPEAKER_00]: like this certain tea I was making this,
like I used to make this, uh, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: call it, um, compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it the vat, gay tea,
the vat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had like, yeah, it's like this net.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this was the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you take your back one,
it was a couple of different kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you take your seabird guano,
high phosphorus in your high phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: back guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in there with a little maxi
crop, you know, uh, yeah, a little sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put one of those,
not just an air bubble in the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these things were really hard to get
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really hard to find these,
but I would go find these fish pond or I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these big saltwater fish tank pumps
where they actually suck the water up at a
[SPEAKER_00]: very high volume, bring it up to the top
of the pump head, which is kind of hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: on and say like the edge of a trash can or
whatever you got the vat, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, mixes it with air and actually
had a tube going out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just like a, I don't know
what they call them, but, um, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the idea was it was creating like a
vigorous and a, uh, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sucking action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got, it's like agitating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have waters agitating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's adding air to it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing, when the power would go off,
this was be the first thing that the
[SPEAKER_00]: generator would get.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the first thing that I'd
plug into the generator was this pump.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when this thing was humming and I
would never use more than half of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all the stuff my friend
originally showed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all his tricks and it,
man, it was, I got 72 ounces of chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: off of two 1000s on light tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I brought everybody, I had to go
over to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: People drove from, four hours away to come
see these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy, but, um, you know,
I would go every time I water my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stick my hand in the vat and I
would only use this thing once every two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and do a lot of top dressings and
I would take my hand and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm an electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always doing some sort of physical
project, messing with tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got some sort of Nick on my
hand always even right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would take my hand, I would stir it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time I would be done,
by the time I'd water my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: just what the, what the regular regiment,
the regular water, that little cut on my
[SPEAKER_00]: hand would be nice and red and looking
like it's already infected just 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, all right, tomorrow,
tomorrow we're going to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready, you know, and then I would
only use half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how I had to, no matter how much
I had to spread it, how many plants I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to spread over, I would never use more
than half of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would fill it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very careful of course,
to make sure that the water was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not didn't have a chlorine or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was basically some sort of
compost tea action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were getting with it, you know,
but, um, but the inconsistency thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't really happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just doesn't, it's just,
it pretty much comes out the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it looks as pretty on day
56 as the silver chem does, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, it's still my favorite manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people around me,
it's their favorite one still,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we keep on that same topic of like a
kind of technology in the garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, what are some updates?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you running nowadays?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you converted over to our,
you know, your nano lux slash Gavita
[SPEAKER_02]: double in bulbs, or are you still a simple
man with just your tents and your HIDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I am using the, uh, not the Gavitas,
but I'm using the, uh, um, the hydro farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phantoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, same thing, double ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little different of a,
I didn't have, you know, the reason I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that is that they have the right
hood, I guess you'd call it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the insert, the reflector, they have the
right reflector, um, for my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I can't go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't raise like I would need to for the
Gavitas to get that high over the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use this other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a more open pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put it on light movers just
because, uh, let me, why not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it seems to work good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes the shadows out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always, I've always really liked,
those things I got away from using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off with them and I really like
them because, you know, it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you see some of these, these,
I don't really have the type of grow where
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, it's a small thing that I have and I
can't like cover the whole thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be an aisle way over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a cabinet over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I use the light movers to
kind of try to compensate for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, lack of total coverage I've got,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, besides that, you know,
I do different things at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it depends on what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we do, sometimes we're doing a
little organic and sometimes we're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little mostly some, some custom salt mixes
we've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just over the course of the
bunch of years, you know, you just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: some things work and some things,
some things help you out and some things
[SPEAKER_00]: are just literally a waste of money,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and I've, I, anybody out there
who's growing or learning, I, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing I could tell you is less is
more and, and keep it simple, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it's, it's, it's really,
they call it weed for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really have to do that much to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, it's got to give it a
little food and enough to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: tell it what time it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think that, I think most of the
skill when it comes to growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't, uh, what you feed, what your plant,
your, your, your, you know, your regimen
[SPEAKER_00]: is or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really on how you train your
plants and how you treat them in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially I think it's how you train your
plants and you know, how you shape them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Sarah sculpt them, you know,
to get them to where they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring you the most for their little space
that they're going to have with the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that that lights directly above them and
not to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's not going to move from
this point of sky as the season changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always in the same spot with that all
taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is the thing that you
can, you know, give yourself better
[SPEAKER_00]: results with more than anything else that
I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't really see, you know,
people going, Oh, I'm using this and now
[SPEAKER_00]: look what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people use what they feel
comfortable with their, their,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, recipes and their regiments,
you know, they're, you know, Duke,
[SPEAKER_00]: he uses all kinds of stuff over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tells me things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you do what now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met him recently in life and he's
fucking, he's an interesting cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like his attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell he's good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but yeah, he tells me some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like some, I would eat shit,
but, um, but I guess, I think it mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: has to do with, with, uh, remembering that
you're in a sprint when you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you're not in a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get today twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get today once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you didn't do today, what had to be
done, you don't get to do it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just missed it and maybe you should
jot it down and make sure you didn't the
[SPEAKER_00]: next time you get a chance and make sure
you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then along with that,
just, you know, keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like, you know, watch your plants
and see, see, see which way they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're trying to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they respond quick,
you know, they don't, they don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not like you have to wait half your
life to figure out what you did work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got, you got a short period
of time, you're going to find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: your results are and, you know,
be, keep your mind open and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and really look at everything you're
doing, you know, don't turn your eyes away
[SPEAKER_00]: from something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because you thought it worked in the
past, you know, keep it all on the table
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of you and try to make sure that
you're, you're fine tuning everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just one aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like am I feeding my plants the right
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see so many people that get caught up in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think it's like, it's a dead
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really matter that much really,
you know, you know, you can use any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools that are available to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got so many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you learn how to use them properly,
I would imagine that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get good results if
everything else is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my buddy said, it's light air and
water and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no more complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, for this next part, we just might
move on to some kind of less growing based
[SPEAKER_02]: questions, some kind of more cannabis
scene slash community related questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, were you, uh, quick to jump onto the,
as like a medical patient or were you kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a bit hesitant and you just kind of did
your own thing without really engaging in
[SPEAKER_02]: the medical community?
[SPEAKER_02]: So much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And furthermore, do you think that the
kind of the medical scene in America is
[SPEAKER_02]: working for the people in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, me, I, uh, I, I'm kind of hardcore
about all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I, when I, when two 15, I remember
when proposition two 15, when the petition
[SPEAKER_00]: was being passed around, I remember I went
in front of this grocery, a Safeway or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, and this guy asked me if I
wanted to sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I said, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, because I think it should be
legal for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you should have to be sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, in my mind, I was like,
you know, and that was a really foolish
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, when I looked back and I was
some serious dumb youth right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's, that's how I felt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, it should be legal
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when proposition two 15 happened,
I think we all, no matter what our feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: on it was, I think that the way that the
proposition was written, I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing because it was so basic and simple
and it was so vague that it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreted to mean basically that,
you know, there was no limits,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was just not plant limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just no limitations to this,
the way they were so masterfully vague,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we all rejoice when that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like, I think it was,
you know, amazing moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that me personally,
I don't think I took it in for what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: worth at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being is because I feel
like I just didn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did not believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that that's really how it was,
you know, until I was at a concert down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the South Bay and we had quite a who's who
of people with cannabis came to a suite we
[SPEAKER_00]: had there one night in Santa Clara,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we were at the shoreline show
and this is, you know, this was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2002 or three, this is much farther
after Jerry died.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is after kids and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all settled down, but we were
anyways, we're at this hotel and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and it was definitely getting a
little hairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend had just given me this,
this one of these hand blown on a lathe
[SPEAKER_00]: glass, you know, glass pipe bongs,
you know, like the ones that they spin on
[SPEAKER_00]: the lathe, very nice piece, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're putting that and then then we
have the guy with the bubble hash shows
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first guy that ever showed me
a bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows up and he's got his full melt and
we're just smoking and it's just one after
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, it's just me and my
buddy in the room and the kids are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back room and it's separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a door that's separate and they're
asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get that knock at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack, crack, crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, the police are out there and
someone had complained, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, we're, you know, we come from a
place where it's really not that big a
[SPEAKER_00]: deal up in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can, you can smoke weed pretty
much in public like you can in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco almost now, but we're not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Santa Clara.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much more conservative,
conservative place and sure enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was some police at the door and we
opened the door and I went outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, we're coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, now without a warrant,
we go through this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing you know, I'm in
handcuffs sitting on the floor and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: searching the room and they find some pie
and they find a, you know, maybe a scale
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nothing much was, but it was a big
deal to them, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And uh, they arrest me and, and uh,
and you know, the next thing I know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in, you know, later that week I'm
sitting in front of an attorney and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first question she asked me is,
so do you have your proposition to 15?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, it was like the most
embarrassing moment of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think practically I said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, well, she's very
professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, well, can I ask you why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, it hit me right then I was
like, this is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm sitting in front of an attorney
that I just paid money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her question to me is, why don't you
have your two 15?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm paying her to ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fool I am, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I got a little pop plants and
I got it, you know, my garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a couple of the outdoor in the
garden up at the house, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the time, I don't know,
I felt like a fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was like, and you know,
proposition to 15 was in 1996,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and I didn't get my medical until
I was in 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a good three years later and
that's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: She basically, you know, was like,
you know, you need to go see a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm like, well,
I don't really, I'm not sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she goes, look, you don't understand
how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you don't have to be sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use it for anything besides like,
you just get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, I mean, I mean, you know,
traffic irritates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke weed, you know, and like life gets
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she goes, that's, that's a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me it was such an alien idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went and saw the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked to me and he's like,
you know, he asked me all the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell him, and then I suddenly felt
like a patient, you know, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it felt legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, we took all this to the,
to the, you know, we, she did her thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't, we didn't go to court
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they, they ended up
dropping the charges and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it happened for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, I've, I've, uh,
you know, in my, my years traveling around
[SPEAKER_00]: the grateful dead and everything else
associated that we, we learned how to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive in the shadows in America,
you know, and, and I kind of got
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, I think even as things
are, you know, as we're recreations when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lying here in America, I think I'm
still dealing with that a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes I see what people were
doing out there and I'm like, God dang,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, you guys are over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're actually really
successful and they're putting their
[SPEAKER_00]: dreams together because they came out of
the shadows to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I struggle with that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that when I, that's,
it took me a while to get my medical
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as medical in America, I want to
say yes, but I, I don't, I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't know if I have the whole view
on that because of my lack of really
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding completely what's how CBD
works and how it helps people with various
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just my lack of understanding it
just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my answer would be that it would be
great if we would just open this up and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, uh, in America here and,
and, and try to figure out what is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helping people in a, in situations,
A, B and C and, and, and try to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, that's how I, I think
that, you know, I just want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from a science base point of
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the medical side of
cannabis, like what exactly does this
[SPEAKER_00]: help?
[SPEAKER_00]: But being careful with, you know,
we're getting pretty far away in America
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just remembering that it's just a
fucking plant, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everyone's so hyped,
hyped up on, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulate tax, the cannabis, you know,
producer, like you do an alcohol producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, and then that brings up
that same kind of militant attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, it's like, it's not like
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's more like Valerian or it's
more like, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more like an herb or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol is poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, yeah, you know,
I like glass along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to get, and if,
and if, and since we're already on this
[SPEAKER_00]: road, because you know, reality is
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're on this road where we're going
to regulate it, tax black alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the phrase that people are
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then treat me like, you know,
treat me like a small brewery,
[SPEAKER_00]: treat me like a winery or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't treat me like I'm making
meth or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making like, you know, oxycodone in
my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like treat me like I'm making out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me have the same rights as those
people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they got plenty of rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in wine country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what they get away with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, or, you know, just let people
leave it be like it's a tomato plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which is what I would prefer if
they would just leave it alone and let,
[SPEAKER_00]: let the market sort itself out,
you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say, so what are some of
the, uh, the pitfalls that, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: other countries could learn from America?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like surely there were some things that
happened after legalization, which in
[SPEAKER_02]: retrospect you realize were negatives,
but maybe initially you thought they were
[SPEAKER_02]: positives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, what should we be on the
lookout for?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, see, I guess when you ask that,
that comes to mind is a dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, that's just, that's just part
of the fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's part of the scene now,
but in the beginning, and even the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who wrote the proposition to 15,
that's exactly what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't want, you know, they knew that if,
if we allowed, if, if we allow people to,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, you know, cannabis in like a
dispensary situation, that's exactly where
[SPEAKER_00]: the federal government would get involved
right there, you know, right when you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that transaction that they would have a
problem with that, you know, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: never intended, and actually my doctor
was, uh, in the room when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: brainstorming to 15 and he explained this
to me and he said that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we never intend, we never saw that
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assumed that then when he said,
when I say we am talking like I'm him,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, we never thought that that would
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that as soon as that happened
and we, that the feds would shut it down
[SPEAKER_00]: and that wouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we would be left with is,
you know, farmers market type things,
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanges and, and, but mainly everyone
having the right to grow their own pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was really the main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, you know, as when
legalization happens, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they weren't being realistic in my
opinion, because, you know, not everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow their own, you know, I mean,
that's just that most people can't,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have the space, they don't have
the physical capabilities, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have, they don't, they don't
want to learn a skill just to get
[SPEAKER_00]: something they've been using their whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the law says that's what you
have to do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think as when legalization
happens in places where it's beginning to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen and it hasn't even gotten this far,
like maybe where you're at or anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else, I think just keeping an eye on that,
you know, making sure that the structure
[SPEAKER_00]: of how cannabis gets from the grower to
the end user, just making sure that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't, don't let any, cause that's
where all the shady, the shady characters
[SPEAKER_00]: have popped into this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, in my opinion, I think that
that the lure and, and that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure and apparatus has allowed
the people who really just want and for
[SPEAKER_00]: the money that's given them the door and
you know, you know, they, they've
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled, they, they, that basically
gave them the keys to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they decide how much pot costs,
you know, and, uh, I don't, I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's, I don't, I think that could
have been, we've gotten away with it here
[SPEAKER_00]: and it went okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that part could be definitely
organized better as it's growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where marijuana has become legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, just touching back on a point you
made, you made earlier on in terms of how
[SPEAKER_02]: you were saying, we need to figure out
whether it's, you know, maybe the THC or
[SPEAKER_02]: the CBD, for example, which is actually
giving them additional benefit on your,
[SPEAKER_02]: just in your personal experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you mentioned earlier,
your fiance uses for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that the high THC strains are
actually for the most people, the most
[SPEAKER_02]: effective because what we're seeing in
Australia, for example, is that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: big push to tell people that CBD is what's
the benefit out of marijuana and that THC
[SPEAKER_02]: is just this recreational side component
that you don't really need.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, do you feel like that's a
total misrepresentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's no possible way that
anyone could a hundred percent tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what any given individual,
whether it be a kid with seizures or
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who's going through chemo,
what they're getting, what in cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them the benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's an entourage effect,
I think is what we, we agree the phrase we
[SPEAKER_00]: agree on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's simply,
and now with the introduction of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of, of, you know, I was breaking all the
terpenes and isolating them all out and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding that like, these are
powerful, powerful substances,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we, and now we're trying to fit
that into the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started off with taking the THC out,
you know, you got, I mean, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who's ever used marijuana and been
raving about it, you know, so that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then the CBD and you think,
oh man, we just saved the whole world with
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's turning out not to be the
case when we isolate it and give that to
[SPEAKER_00]: people certainly helps with certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's some other gray
areas here that I'm not covered or
[SPEAKER_00]: probably even aware of, but I think that
the whole plant concentrated or just the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant consumed, I think seems to be
the universal, you know, uh, kind of helps
[SPEAKER_00]: with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what I mean, like it seems to
me that the people who have the access to
[SPEAKER_00]: the high T and C stuff, they seem to be
the ones that rave the most me,
[SPEAKER_00]: my experience from what I hear,
my perception to me about the benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're getting from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, I think that that's a big
misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that THC is a very important part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it goes back to what I
said, I think that, you know, these things
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be broken down in a scientific way
and understood before we start telling
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: About what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, millions of people are
having positive effects on their life and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should, in the meantime,
while the government catches up to
[SPEAKER_00]: society, which is basically what we're
waiting for is, you know, just the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day in the United States, I'm sure you
know that the DEA after a bunch of fanfare
[SPEAKER_00]: this summer, they decided, and I got to
say, like, how did, how did my democracy
[SPEAKER_00]: turn into a place where some bureaucracy
decides what's dangerous and what's not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that, I mean, couldn't we at least
have a photo on that in Congress or
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, this, that's the way
where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just denied, they just,
you know, almost in a joke, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: came out and said that they still think
that there's zero medical benefit to us
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to keep it remain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to keep it under schedule
one, you know, as opposed to schedule two,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be a recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocaine isn't scheduled to, you know,
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that that has a medical benefit
as whereas cannabis doesn't, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin and PC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And LSD, for instance, you know,
I mean, it's just so it's we're so our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our research and our main, and especially
our government is, is keeping this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: moving at such a pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we'll ever know what,
what the deal is with cannabis and what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's trying to help us with and what the,
what the goal is here with that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, and really break it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, here in America, that's what we're
good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, I feel like that's what
we've been always doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we take something and we get down to
the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientifically, we always have in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we like to take, tell
ourselves when we, when we look at our
[SPEAKER_00]: history, you know, like we've got,
we put the man on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured it out, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I would love to see us
go in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see it happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for obvious reasons,
because it's more profitable right now to
[SPEAKER_00]: cage humans than it is to, you know,
take less medicine, take, take people's
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine cabinets and empty them and,
and, putting a plant in there instead,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for many, many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some reason, it makes more sense to
society right now, uh, officially to
[SPEAKER_00]: demonize this and continuously put people
in cages and lawyers and judges and
[SPEAKER_00]: Colonel clerics and the whole,
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just don't think that I,
I like Florida comes to mind the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing in Florida,
when you talk about the CBD thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying, there's a lot of States
where, and at the beginning, it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: warm, fuzzy thing where we're going to
have CBD, like South Carolina for all
[SPEAKER_00]: places that you can, you can have CBD oil
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even import it into the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand my, my family, some of my
family lives there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's like the most backwards
conservative place and in Florida and
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it's like they're jumping the
gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I respect that they're trying to
help, you know, I think that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: when a, when a small child is having
seizures and is having a horrible life,
[SPEAKER_00]: it compels even these guys who can't see
past their own biases towards this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see past it just enough to help
those people, but they're making laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and those laws will have to be
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to be, you know,
uh, rearrange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to be, you know,
revisited at some time in the future as a
[SPEAKER_00]: science comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I just think you gotta be cautious
with that, you know, because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know, you know, THC is,
is powerful medicine and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's our bodies receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It well, so it's gotta be something to it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that, um, for new
countries that are just kind of writing
[SPEAKER_02]: their own legislation, do you think that
the most important thing to maintain is
[SPEAKER_02]: that you need to be able to grow your own
medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think that, um, you know,
it, it's maybe okay to forego that right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be able to say, get it from,
say a mass supplier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause just for it to give some context to
this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Australia currently, the model
proposed is looking like you won't be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow it yourself, but you know,
some big Philip Morrison tobacco conglomer
[SPEAKER_02]: will probably be producing a ton of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that we should compromise for
that or the, at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing your own needs to be the end goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, well, and you're,
and you're saying that they're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about doing this in the medical aspect,
not recreational.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no recreational only medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I, I, I, I, and as I get older,
I'm more this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe that self reliance is,
is one of the highest of human qualities,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, uh, growing your own food
and making sure that your, your location,
[SPEAKER_00]: the place where you call home as good
clean source of water and figuring out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not clean and growing your own
cannabis as part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't see it any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot, I, you know, companies that
you're speaking to, you know, like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just Philip Morrison, those types of
comments, but even like just bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that provide things that people
use every day in life, say food and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, it's, to me, it's really important to
get away from all that and to find more
[SPEAKER_00]: local sources, uh, and, and more
importantly, produce things that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself, you know, because I think
that I just think that if we all do that
[SPEAKER_00]: life, the machine slows down to the point
where we can maybe have a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: spaceship here on earth, you know,
and that if, if people spend more time
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to take care of their more basic
needs on their own, not like, Oh no,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, not, not in a mean way, but like,
as in, this is what I'm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what we want our society to be
like people, you know, families take being
[SPEAKER_00]: self reliant, you know, and, and learning
how to like be healthy and feed themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: without help from the companies,
the corporations and the government and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, there's no other way
for me to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I really think that cannabis plant is
no different than a tomato plant and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be able to grow either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that being said, yeah,
you know, it is, is that, like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: before, not everybody's going to be able
to do that for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that you have to have that
right to do that though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you have to, you have to,
it's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and by the way, if, if you have a
system, where you're not allowed to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can buy it from whatever people
are still going to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did you really accomplish?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just made some more laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, you just, without even trying,
you just made some more penalties for
[SPEAKER_00]: people in life, you know, cause people are
still going to grow their own pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can, I can get, you know,
shit, I don't even know where I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to think of a good example, eggs,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get eggs from the factory farm at
the state, at the store, but I have my own
[SPEAKER_00]: chickens and I get my eggs from chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can eat GMO free eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I shouldn't have to be forced to
go deal with some company that has
[SPEAKER_00]: different values in me, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we just kind of, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just saying, I think that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think that's really important
to fight against that net.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they're, they're just at
one little addition to what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that you should make that
compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, here in California
in 2010, we had a legalization thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was called proposition 10 or 20
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember, but it failed and it
failed because it was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It legalized cannabis, but it also created
other laws that more penalties for things
[SPEAKER_00]: that people were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, there was a,
there was some sort of clause in there
[SPEAKER_00]: where you had to have your, you know,
your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was extra, there was new penalties
for, for people who had their children
[SPEAKER_00]: around their cannabis grows or a cannabis
situation in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it lost, you know, it's
surprisingly lost because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the voters of California took all this
into account and many people in California
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis says, you know, and it
failed because, you know, we couldn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: those compromises just to have
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here again with AUMA, uh,
proposition 64 coming in November,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's not doing so well in the
community because people are having the
[SPEAKER_00]: same kind of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, does this protect the small
growers or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go to where the money is and who
the backers are, and it gets even more
[SPEAKER_00]: unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do see, you know, to your point of
the question that, you know, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: compromise that has been made there and
you have to like, you know, you,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be losers, but we don't
want to see new penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that anything that says you
can't grow is a terrible idea because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you're really, you're really just
creating more criminals when you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you can't grow plants,
you're creating an environment where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's criminals, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say criminals, I mean,
dudes like me, I ain't a criminal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, people who are breaking the
law, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so this is kind of a little bit of
left field question, but I wanted to ask,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's your thoughts on the concentration
community and maybe the possible kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: negative impact they have on our image.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our last episode, Duke referenced that,
you know, some of the people who are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, really heavily onto concentrates
these days, more resemble crack addicts
[SPEAKER_02]: than marijuana users.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that's potentially like
a negative thing or do you think on the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole, we should just try to push the
stoner image and make it more mainstream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you're saying about the image
and, um, I think it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of funny too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, it's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to, I don't even know if
I've put my whole opinion on this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've even formed my opinion,
but I think that, you know, it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, that's, that's not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might get more refined in better
processes and standards, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely popular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, uh, I smoked the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, it's not because of any,
it's not like I'm anti solvent or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I really love, it's,
it goes back to being self reliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to make casual or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really have a desire to,
I've, I've messed around with it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not that interesting to me really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I feel like the ceiling of,
of what captivates my imagination about
[SPEAKER_00]: learning something new is I hit it really
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so rosin is like a self reliant
thing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the fact that I can take my
favorite strain instead of smoking someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else's trim that's been made into a
concentrate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even luckily, if you're lucky enough
smoking their fresh frozen live resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they call it, they've made into a
country, which I love that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some amazing products coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, this tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, but I love the fact that I
can just take one of my own buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: stick it in some paper and smush it and
then do a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I really liked the ritual of doing a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I don't like smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I'm really, I have a really strong,
I feel like I have a really strong sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of smell and smoke, even cannabis smoke,
it, it, it aggravates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, I had allergies in the spring
and, um, so I got like a sensitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a respiratory system and
smoking anything is not my favorite thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm not saying I want to eat
because I don't like eating cannabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as I like the instant smoking,
the instant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that instantaneous effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I feel like it's, it's,
it, it satisfies me in a way because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: self it's just self-reliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I have everything I need right in
my kitchen just to quickly make up a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not, you know,
and people who are hearing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: who make dabs or smoke dabs are going to
go, Oh God, not the rosin, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it's so, they're so hard on it,
but it's actually, you know, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: damn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I get to smoke the
flavors I want to smoke instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: settling for some other strain that
somebody else, you know, did it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to smoke, you know, Kim dog,
you know, so, um, but as far as the image
[SPEAKER_00]: goes, you know, it doesn't look good,
but it's definitely so mainstream now that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, uh, the public's perception
of it's changing and it doesn't look as
[SPEAKER_00]: bad as it did three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as long as people don't blow up houses
and continuously do that, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been going on, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, in terms of all the recent
breeders kind of coming out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: woodworks, what's your feelings on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess more specifically,
how do you feel about kind of companies
[SPEAKER_02]: using the chem dog name as a way of,
you know, trying to boost their product?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you think it's like,
you know, do you ever want to call these
[SPEAKER_02]: people out or do you just think like,
look, the end of the day, everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: always going to try to say they've got
like, you know, quote the highest quality
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients in their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, by the natural extension,
people are going to lie and say that the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog is the real chem dogs used in
their strain when maybe it's not,
[SPEAKER_02]: or heck, I've even seen strains that don't
even have chem dog in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got like chem dog references
in the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, you know, yeah, there's some,
there's some companies that have used that
[SPEAKER_00]: name and they've really done well with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you mentioned one earlier and I
can think of one other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, when I first saw that,
when I first came out of the shadows and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, looked at an Instagram or,
you know, went to one of the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: carnivals as Duke calls it, you know,
I, uh, I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, these people will say
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even, it's not even close to
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the stories, you know,
like when I, you know, I got back on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet in 2012, you know, you know,
some people asked me that what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of the same questions you
asked me about the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, that's not what I
heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, I'm telling you about
my life, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not repeating some story that I heard
at somebody's house or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you what happened in my life,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the, please understand that,
you know, so I was really frustrated
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when my friend showed me the
picture on the package, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely my picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you gotta be kidding me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a free for all, but you know,
and of course it made me feel a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, you know, I was angry
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's not right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put my fucking blood, sweat and
freedom on the line for this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be fucking, you know,
I don't want to see someone making
[SPEAKER_00]: trillion dollars off of a lie,
you know, but you know, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, I'm not really, it's not my MO to go
around calling people out on their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, like I said, we'll all be sitting
around, you know, at a table, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, figuratively speaking,
and we all got stories and your stories
[SPEAKER_00]: either a bullshit lie or you really,
you really put your heart and soul into
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put my heart and soul into this and
I still to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, I don't like it,
but it's a waste of my energy to go around
[SPEAKER_00]: and police that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I, I'm just going to, you know,
what I want to, when you, when you,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you, to describe the situation you're
talking about, the only answer is just to
[SPEAKER_00]: go blow, blow them out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you got the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many times does that happen
where you like, you smoke a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone tells you the chem dog,
you're like, here, dudes hit this instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, it's the chem dog,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you just moved to me,
but that's the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, you know, do your thing and
make it, make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if you just tell the truth,
man, you know, like live, live,
[SPEAKER_00]: live by the golden rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't have to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to make up a fucking weird
story for everyone to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just, you can just tell the
people the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lived your life for right away,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll, I think in the end it's
all, it's all going to sort itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those people crushing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they be crushing it five years from
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but you know, I just think
that, you know, I think that the truth at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day, you know, is,
is what people are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't want to hear the
bullshit lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's some of these
people we've talked about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not here to talk shit about
anybody, but some of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them have, you know, they've
fucking blatantly lied and known about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they've gotten really successful
and practically famous for some of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for their company, whatever
their thing is and their lie or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it just sorts itself out at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're a customer, say
somebody, some dude in like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois and you know, you want to get
some seeds or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go to the guy that's got
a funny reputation for Hermes seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really, can't really tell you
exactly where he got this, the stuff he
[SPEAKER_00]: says he got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, or are you going to
go where, you know, you definitely know
[SPEAKER_00]: this dude is like been doing this for
whatever you're probably going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want the chem dog, you're going to
go where you know, the chem dog came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will, there'll be an Exodus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a kind of our last extended
response question that we've got just some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of more short answer ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a bit lighthearted when,
when talking to people about chem dog and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the different varieties, what do you
find is the part that gets confused the
[SPEAKER_02]: most?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the fact that there's, you know,
there's the D, the three, the four,
[SPEAKER_02]: the 91, and people just confuse the names
or do you think like it's all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different aspects of the history,
which people confuse more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, what, what do you find kind of,
I, I, maybe it's not frustrating,
[SPEAKER_02]: but when you're trying to talk to people
about it, what do you find gets kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to correct the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: The volume of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much bullshit that it's
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost tiring to hear, you know,
let me think, let me think about that
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, if you,
if we actually look at Leafley at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment, which is kind of, you know,
the go-to website for people to look up
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, it says that chem 91 was a strain
created from the original chem dog crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: to skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't they have like a big joke about them
saying that the sour diesel is an Indica
[SPEAKER_00]: or hybrid?
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's a sativa and AJ is trying to
get them to make it a hybrid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of, so I guess they are already,
are like kind of, then they're notable for
[SPEAKER_02]: getting things wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like they're, they're gaining
their own kind of reputation in a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of making their own reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should probably check their sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, remember that, um,
the Canada Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that book that was coming
out in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: They had, they had the chem dog story
wrong in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we're, you're, you're talking
about a coffee table book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick up and I mean, I'm looking at
it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my fiance's, uh, it's on her
bookshelf right now and they got the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog story wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's, I think it's,
it would have been more useful if people
[SPEAKER_00]: would have taken their firsthand knowledge
and spread that around as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to believe or the best version
they heard or, or however they came to
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would have been more useful to
the whole community if they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: just used the firsthand knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe now as we move forward and
people can come out of the shadows a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more who actually, you know,
um, know what's up, they know that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: there and maybe that will sort of fix
itself too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I, I find it, it doesn't,
it used to, it used to bother me more than
[SPEAKER_00]: it does now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to me, it's just like, it's more
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything you're like, why,
you know, it's, it's like, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes back to the truth is way more
interesting than fiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always, I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the best craziest stories you've ever
heard are true stories, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why, why do you got to make up
a story?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the original, the store,
what actually happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so mind-blowingly interesting when
you look at the different, the
[SPEAKER_00]: coincidences and the chance happening,
the chance meetings and just like the once
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lifetime events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like how could that have even
happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so much more interesting than,
you know, what everybody's opinion about
[SPEAKER_00]: this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you like how I felt when
someone questioned my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I, when I finally told it to them,
they asked me and they, and they,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they didn't question it like directly,
but they were like, well, what I heard was
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I just told you,
like I said before, I just told you what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you, why are you still telling me
that version?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my, one of my favorite one was
when the chem dog was being passed when
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole Joe, Joe, Jay, uh, Joe brand
thing happened in that fake chem dog that
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that was, it to me, I think it
was a res dog sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is what it was, but uh,
it was a chunky sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I said, I had to go around and
give a lot of bad news that summer and um,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, what was I saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, oh, you know, I would, I would,
people that were, I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: close to me, but people that were in my
outer circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would come in contact with
them, people who I was new well enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about this stuff with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, look, I got the chem dog,
check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go, this is not the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, then you have to give them a
little bit of background about how you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that of course, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is not the chem dog because of
APNC, you know, like some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they still call it chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, dude, you literally got right
from the horse's mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're told the this is my chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but, and for some reason,
I mean, give it another name, just name it
[SPEAKER_00]: something else now, you know, like make
something up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but that's not the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really, that broke me down
because those were some hard days for me
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm telling you, man, like talk
about units and where they got to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, like I've always, the chem dog has
always been my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's some sort of confusion
there, man, it really hit me hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one point where I was like,
what do I even have this plan for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, I know why I had it,
but as far as the other things are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, besides smoking it and I was
like, what am I banging my head against
[SPEAKER_00]: this wall for?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to mean, you know,
so, but there are other stories and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I hear them and I, and I try to
try to see like where they got,
[SPEAKER_00]: how this, you know, like when you're in
kindergarten and you pass a secret around
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and a story is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets back over here, I try to
figure out how did that story get to be
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'm like, I think someone
just made this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds like a bunch of bullshit to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always, always less interesting
than the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard one story that was like,
wow, let's just change the story to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's way cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, for the last little bit,
it's just some kind of lighthearted
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one being, um, if you could
go to one place on earth at any time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, presumably to collect some land
race seeds, where would you go?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what era?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the era.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, um, I would say I would like
to go to the Hindu Kush region in
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan, the high, the high mountains
of Afghanistan and, um, and see what they
[SPEAKER_00]: had up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's, that's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cannabis that speaks to me the
most, you know, I would have liked to have
[SPEAKER_00]: been, I, there's a legend that,
uh, the skunk was found in the wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the Ohio River.
[SPEAKER_00]: River Valley, somewhere in Kentucky or
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have loved to have been there
when that happened, you know, when,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, not necessarily in the wild as legend
goes, but it, that it was, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the people that, that had it,
that passed it on, that's what they found
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that they're, that the legend
that they were going off was that the
[SPEAKER_00]: native Americans there had been working
with it and they, that it was sacred plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have loved to have been there for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been there to witness that moment when
that whole realization, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and, and then when I look at the
catalog and I see the man standing in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like bunker in front of all the
hash and, and I'm looking around and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you got this white dude,
you know, and, and he's like standing
[SPEAKER_00]: there with like these, you know,
these, these soldiers, these warriors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the family men, the warriors
fighting the, the, the Soviet empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, some way this guy gains
enough trust to go and look at the big
[SPEAKER_00]: headstache, you know, look at the spot
when they're keeping all the hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that'd be, I mean, that's,
that couldn't imagine a more powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: moment than that, as far as cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, that's just, that's some,
that's some serious networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's before email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just like, how did that
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a contribution, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could only hope that, um, one day I'd be
able to chat to Neville about how that all
[SPEAKER_02]: happened and hopefully he'd share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know where he's at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, um, he's currently in Australia,
so not too far away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not far from me, but, um, unfortunately
he's actually battling, um, some cancer at
[SPEAKER_02]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not too confident he'd be kind of
up to feeling up to doing an interview,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, you know, we obviously send our
best wishes to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I likewise out there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause to me, that guy, uh, he,
he made the biggest contribution to
[SPEAKER_00]: contemporary cannabis that there won't,
there won't be a bigger contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution than that, you know,
just collecting all that, working it and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and giving it to the world and the heat in
the height of the drug war was just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he certainly, um, I mean him and I
think Shanti Barbara has also done,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some comparable amount of work,
but yeah, I think they definitely have
[SPEAKER_02]: done a lot, especially in terms of like
just laying the groundwork for future
[SPEAKER_02]: people, if nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's certainly something to shoot
for, you know, no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So onto our next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one might, you might have to struggle
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think you might want to give them
all them one, but if you could only change
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing about the 91, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would want it to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I would, it's lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk in notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lost a note or two on the flavor
since I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like, there was this deep,
dark, dark earthy flavor that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you get it, but it's, it's diminished
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like for that to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but overall without going back to
something that maybe we've lost with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, it's hard for me to say,
cause it's, it's, you know, I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: it to be more, you know, chunky and you
know, the shape to be a little bit tighter
[SPEAKER_00]: on the tops and the edges, like we were
talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wish, uh, I don't think it's
the prettiest pot in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that, you know,
I think that only on, on all the things we
[SPEAKER_00]: judge cannabis on, I think that's probably
gets more attention than it deserves the
[SPEAKER_00]: look of it, you know, but, uh,
opposed to the flavor and the smell and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course the drug traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I would say that that would be
the one thing that I would want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: look, look, just looked a little bit
nicer, you know, like more shaped,
[SPEAKER_00]: more shaped buds and, and, uh,
more uniform on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'm a, I'm a big, I'm a big fan of
the Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not, it's a tough answer cause I
really don't see how you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: something much more better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so when you do get the seed
company up and running, um, I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've obviously got some own personal
goals to get done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you, however, considered possibly
doing a collab with someone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever thought like, I'd love to
get my own stuff going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, like Duke's got some
cool stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could do a collab or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Duke's actually, he's, uh,
he's really inspired me when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the, to the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, he's opened my eyes to the
different, um, possibilities with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's really kind of inspired
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I would certainly be interested
in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that those kinds of things are
going to, that's where the real magic is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen when people with their own
views get together and make something like
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a new thing, you know,
like I think that's where a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: magics is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to that, you know,
as we go down the road here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think are some of the most
overhyped slash worst strains you've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: had slash, you know, biggest
disappointments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, you're going to, you're going to
hate the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem D was definitely my, I don't
really, I'm not impressed with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I, uh, it's really good for
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are the patients,
that I'm in contact with, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Kim dog is, is, uh, Kim dog can
actually, if, if you're, if you're not an
[SPEAKER_00]: everyday user, Kim dog can actually make
your anxiety worse in the, in the short
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that Kim, the Kim D I've noticed
that the patients that I'm in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: who have anxiety problems, which is,
you know, you're talking 60% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients you come to that's their,
uh, understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably their main, their, their number
one concern with their health,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as regards to cannabis is their
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one really does seem to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, I don't really know where it
comes out on the THC scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, I don't think the
THC, like we were talking earlier is the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the entourage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could have a strong THC and
not have a real psychedelic type of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, like say the can of the Kim dog
can be to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how that's tied in,
but for some reason, my feedback from
[SPEAKER_00]: people is that it's really good for
anxiety to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you got people describing
Kim dog, Kim D smell as rotting meat,
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic, it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I've had that description a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just like, I don't understand
that one, but, um, but then of course I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke something that smells like,
you know, fuel to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people smell fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really quite get that,
but I, I kind of understand it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think that the fuel, you know,
characteristics that come from camps,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the fuel, I think that kind of
comes more from the name than an act.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know if people smell diesel
when they're smelling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I don't, I don't smell that,
you know, so I guess it would be an
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion thing, but as far as other strains
that were really disappointing than I
[SPEAKER_00]: grew, they were mostly, they were mostly
things that I'm not so sure they were what
[SPEAKER_00]: they, what they, they said they were,
it was a master push that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, and that was nothing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, you know, that cherry pie
that I got, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it, but it did, it put,
it put ball sacks out early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and it was a problem for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I didn't enjoy that,
you know, cause it, um, I didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have much control over it and going
through with the style that I was growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: picking through that, that was kind of
tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, trying to think, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorites that are outside of
the chem dog family were like the super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of out of my zone of
what I like, you know, what I prefer in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of outside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still liked it a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's pretty much, uh, I,
I, you know, I, I think that as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: growers go that have been doing it as long
as I've been, I feel like I've probably
[SPEAKER_00]: grown less strains and most of those
people have, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, the actual countless,
um, of different strains, I think is
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't hold it against you cause you had
the best weed on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I just, this is what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lucky, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I didn't really have me,
there's not many, there's definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: that haven't met the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's definitely been some,
some that I'd felt like I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: space enough to keep, but, um,
you know, we'll, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have too many to say on
that one really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, I really don't love that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I got to say, I really don't get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not speaking bad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that it'll dawn on me at one
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm keeping it for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, I think that there's,
it does carry its traits to pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually seen some crosses that
were supposedly done with Chem D that more
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog notes came out of then say the
Chem D itself had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm keeping it around, um, this time
for, for that reason, cause I want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can work something out with it,
you know, but that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on that list for that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you ever consider, um,
putting out any feminized lines yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, like I was saying before,
I'm going to, I'm going to go take both
[SPEAKER_00]: roads on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do, uh, I, I, I was all about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I got more around the breeders
and the breeder, uh, uh, the, or the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are, are buying the stuff from
the readers and what their opinions are
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of looking, I, I,
like I said, I got this negative that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had this feeling that there was like a
negative thing from the community on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, it's just, to me, it's just
like, you know, I, I, you got to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for some people, sorry,
go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was just going to say,
I think that you just have to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper testing and I don't think,
I think when we started this interview,
[SPEAKER_00]: I never finished that sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I've learned in this is that
you can't just give sheets to people out
[SPEAKER_00]: and call that testing and get feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's useful, but maybe I'm
wrong, but it might, I'm starting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the feeling that you got to do your own
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're really looking for what
you're looking for, you got to be the one
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We certainly see that with, uh,
the likes of brothers, Grim and Swamp Boy
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds now doing all in-house testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just kind of, uh, bringing us to that
same point of what the people kind of want
[SPEAKER_02]: and talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we often hear this talk about people
saying, you know, like we need to return
[SPEAKER_02]: to our land race roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any, um, kind of plans to,
to work with land races and say the cam
[SPEAKER_02]: dog, for example, or is your plans more so
to kind of stay with, um, more mainstream
[SPEAKER_02]: things and not necessarily looking to
reinvent the wheel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not looking to reinvent the
wheel as long as, you know, I'm trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see, I would like to have a
catalog of things that are available that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, um, remind me of, of the strains
that I smoked when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nigerians and after the Afghan crosses
and, um, you know, all those things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we were smoking out of the catalog when I
was a young man, I, uh, I want to get all
[SPEAKER_00]: that variety of flavor back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think even with the highest,
um, the highest quality strains that are
[SPEAKER_00]: out now, they're also similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also for, you know, I mean,
half of them are OG crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the half of them are some sort
of variation on the OG Kush, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, uh, I think we need a little bit
of more variety on that, on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: on that level of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what I mean, not just more
variety, but more variety on that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality where like, instead of having Kim
dog and OG or, and whatever other ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that would fall into that category,
maybe if we had another handful of flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, like a skunk, you know,
like, I don't know a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I can't say, I can't say the last
time I smoked, uh, uh, isolated skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, you know, like I really,
really can't tell you the last time I
[SPEAKER_00]: really smoked a good quality one,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I think if there's, I think it's
like, uh, everything, everything people
[SPEAKER_00]: keep running to one thing, everyone runs
to one thing at the same time all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we keep getting, we're,
we're kind of running around in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this point, you know,
we've got all these different cushions and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're, they're, and there are
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing with the Kim dog
crosses that we've been making is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're, they're, they're very
similar to the Kim dog, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the Kim crush, it's,
it's, uh, it's, it, it, it's funny because
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing I like about it is that it,
it, it does bring back that dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep earthy tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, I do taste it in there and it really
inspires me because I feel like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those genes are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got to get them and isolate them
and stabilize them, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and I feel like it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like we have everything,
you know, uh, everything at our disposal
[SPEAKER_00]: to get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I don't think, uh,
I'm even able to, I think that I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to, I want to do what I'm able
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think I'm able to do is,
is to find those traits that I love that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that everyone really loves and
isolate them, you know, cause I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a, the one thing I feel like I've
got going for me in this endeavor is that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have those memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have those memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have those smells and those flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell the difference between the
solos of what we have now and the heads of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things and the actual thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell the difference in this kind of,
uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like reading or riding a bike or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can consume that, you know, like the
Beatrix choice, like I told you earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think might would most
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in a, in a reinventing world,
but you know, bringing back the old school
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your opinion on organic versus
synthetic?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think you've kind of already
hinted that you're more of a bottled
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's just like a preference
thing or do you think one kind of is
[SPEAKER_02]: better than the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one is better for the other
in certain environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, uh, if in a perfect world,
everything I grew be organic, everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: eat is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I don't put funny products
in my body, in my head, in my head,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, tip, I'm, I'm, I'm health
conscious kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, uh, like I said, I was the last
person in my circles to grow with bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, you know, to even try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, there's no, plus I was having
moderately at the time, very good success
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time at today's bar of what success
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know because I didn't,
I didn't, I didn't put myself up against
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think that when you're growing
indoors, and you're growing organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still growing with bottled
nutrients, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't see a lot of people like
creating their own compost and bringing it
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's truly what organic growing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing with organics,
you're, you're not just using products
[SPEAKER_00]: that just came from the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they mine minerals out of caves in
Jamaica, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but they mine bat guano off the side
of a cliff where bat, where, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: bird guano off the side of a cliff where
birds migrate to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: To breed, you know, themselves,
you know, it's, it's destructive in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I got older and my view of the world
got a little bigger, I realized there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't much difference that the
differences that I was holding onto
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like one was more ecologically
conscious than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you're left with your own health,
which one's healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I would say you're
talking about flavors and variations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're growing indoors,
the reality is, is that it's a sprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not American.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have to happen now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's life cycles extremely quick
and growing an organic indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see people that have really good
success with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see people, a lot of people
growing organic and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you think you're having a really
good success at it, but honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: this shit's burning my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes kind of harsh and it must be
missing something because that's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: it was supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's, like I said,
if I'm growing in the, if I was doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: light depth, it would be organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't use the,
and it would be for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, one being because I can, I can bring
compost up to that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason is because, you know,
actually growing organic on a large scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is actually more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly think so in terms of the cost
effectiveness on larger scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that when you're controlling
the environment, like you are in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room where you have complete control
over everything, air, light, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and food, I think you're, you have to be
realistic about the plant's demands,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are going to be, I know this doesn't
make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be higher on the indoor
situation as far as like potential goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of people who are going
to disagree with this, but I think your
[SPEAKER_00]: potential is higher and that you have,
you're with, as far as what you're feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, you're really just playing
catch up to what everything else is
[SPEAKER_00]: providing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the sun's not, the sun is way brighter
than your grow lights, but this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun's not sitting right over top of
the plant is perfect situation all,
[SPEAKER_00]: all day long either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, there's a lot more variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature is always the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the potential, in my opinion,
for quality is higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really just trying to keep up
with that potential when it comes to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going back to the fact that I
personally, don't think you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: growing organic unless you're,
you know, you're making compost and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, like I used to grow in peat
moss with organic, but the vat,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was telling you earlier,
but that's really hard to plant it
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that soil is a lifeless medium,
you know, and I'm feeding a little life
[SPEAKER_00]: into it every, every once in a while,
but you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the quality was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often ask myself, why don't you give
that a shot?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the life, life moves at the
speed of light around here in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and you kind of just doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked the product that I come
up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super smooth and, and, and high
flavor and it gives me everything I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I definitely want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to experiment a little bit more and
bring back some of those old methods I had
[SPEAKER_00]: and take what I know now and apply it and
see what else I can come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so onto the next question,
kind of tying into that, what would be
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of the biggest mistake you see people
making in growing or maybe another way to
[SPEAKER_02]: put it would be, what would be your tip
for people growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you, you know, for example,
Dukes, he always sees people over
[SPEAKER_02]: watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your kind of take on things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I see a lot of is that when
people find a problem, they come at it
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're, they bum rush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they, and then,
and at the end that the problem might get
[SPEAKER_00]: solved, but they didn't learn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could come in a problem with like an
arsenal of things and methods and try this
[SPEAKER_00]: and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all kinds of shit people
try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, blows me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: People make sprays out of tobacco for
God's sakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that sounds ludicrous to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just take your time,
do your research, think about what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and, and, and like, try to stay on
point with the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just try to come out with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if it happens again, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to come out with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you don't know what you actually did
to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that that would be the
thing I see that happens the most is that
[SPEAKER_00]: people panic when there's something goes
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of just taking their time and
just breaking it apart, plan ahead,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you're not going to hurt,
lose, you know, like a strain or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, like a genetic or something,
but you know, figure out what the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: is and fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then then if it ever happens again,
you can just fix it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I would say about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically, I think you wanted
something more specific, specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people overfeed their plants,
weights and nuts, organic or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people like just throwing money down
the drain, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that a lot as well, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so what in your opinion is the worst
thing to happen to the American cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community, uh, since the medicalization
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like one example would be, um,
kind of the new law is being proposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, you know, you'd be well
aware of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people are kind of
saying that they're a step back in a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what is your, what do you think
is the worst thing to happen since
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst thing to happen since the medical
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't like how, um, let me think
for a second on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to put this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like how the, the grower,
the small time grower is just pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: around, you know, as far as like what the,
what the product goes to market for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that that it's unfortunate
that the person who's producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that everyone's, you know,
interested in right now is the one that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, oftentimes is the one that's
working the hardest to make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's, there's a lot of
factors that have caused that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the worst part,
you know, that I think that I wish that we
[SPEAKER_00]: relived in a situation where growers could
kind of, uh, unionize or create like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, associations where we agree on,
you know, what's fair and what's not fair
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then apply that to the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wish that there was more of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, you basically
got growers competing with each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get their product to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everyone who came to the
cannabis industry lately has taken a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've watched families,
you know, struggle for years on end,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like with all the risks they
take and, and the, um, and all the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a lot of work, you know,
that's, I mean, anyone listening to this
[SPEAKER_00]: knows it's a lot of work growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, nothing easy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work, you know, if you want
it to come out, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see families that, you know,
good, good people, good families that work
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard and they struggle,
but because they're, they're at the mercy
[SPEAKER_00]: of this, of this dynamic in the market
where it's like, I'm not saying that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis should be priced at
this or whatever like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that they have no control
over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the season or,
you know, yeah, at the end of the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, cause those are the ones that
really get hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they ended up competing with
each other, like in a cup throat manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I think legalization had a lot
to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not really sure why, but it
definitely seemed to have gone hand in
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to do with the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has to do with the fact that
everything's more on top of the table now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier for people to take
advantage of that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, to like shop around for the best
prices and everyone has to sell for less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so they can feed their families and
keep the lights on, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep the, keep the roof over their
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bums me out, but I mean, I guess
everything in life's like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, you know, so yeah, that certainly
does seem like a negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of bringing us to our last
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is the best way for a
kind of emerging cannabis medical
[SPEAKER_02]: community to develop?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you think that we shouldn't
go gun hole on trying to legalize
[SPEAKER_02]: everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, you know, what, what would
be your advice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, take things slow,
look to find the best clones first.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, there's a whole variety
of answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I think the whole term
medical is kind of, I think it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a, it implies something that we got to be
careful with, because when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: talking, going back to the here in the
United States, the DA, the DA deciding to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep cannabis as a schedule one drug on
the flip side of that, if they shot,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they chose to keep that as a schedule
two drug, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's medical benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that sounds rosy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we always wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with that is, is that all that
really means is that this is the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, of course, you know, but all that
really means is that the DA can give
[SPEAKER_00]: universities, research institutes,
basically pharmaceutical companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: permission to work with cannabis,
to research it so they can develop their
[SPEAKER_00]: own products, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, the medical thing itself is
still kind of an iffy thing, because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you start, if we start touting,
this is actual medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I'm not allowed to make
Tylenol in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to make oxycodone or,
or statin drugs in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a company that's only allowed to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're allowed to do that because the
DA gives them permission to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be careful with that
because, you know, that's in one way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an open door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also another door that can close on
us pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not careful and they could say,
Whoa, buddy, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whiskey's easy to get, but you're not
allowed to make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are, you certainly are not
allowed to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be very careful if you decide to
make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we're talking about two
different things, but, but, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as medical, I mean, whiskey's not a
medical anything, but it's the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's regulated in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only certain people who've gone through
certain hoops can produce something like
[SPEAKER_00]: whiskey or oxycodone or statin drugs or
whatever they are that they give people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's a, it's a dicey thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's definitely a back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I used to always tell people
it's like, they kept the front door closed
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long and medical marijuana is just
us coming through the back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're just in the living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that door can be closed to
based on the term medical, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is a plant and it definitely
gives people benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I, I wish that instead of trying
to isolate, okay, what does cannabis help
[SPEAKER_00]: people with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish that society would just accept
that cannabis just over helps people
[SPEAKER_00]: overall with their health, health,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: In many different ways, there's not one
particular way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's kind of like,
um, um, what would be another thing like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we all agree that
vitamin C is good for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like eating fruits and vegetables is
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's healthy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people juice vegetables to cure
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, you know, consume mass
amounts of CBD and have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, cured cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, they're not going to
start regulating, you know, cold press
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable juice just because it gives some
great, great benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to start regulating that
like alcohol or tobacco or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's got to be careful
because we're inviting, I think that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have no choice that regulations
coming and it's going to be really unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be, uh, in some aspects
there's going to be winners and losers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I wished that we could get around
that and just legalize it as a plan and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, Hey, you know what we have,
you go around the farmer's market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy some broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy next door, it's got some cannabis
for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it could be like that, but I know
it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be, cause we've already gone
so far down this road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and so that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think medical, you gotta be careful with
it's a double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think not now today it's rosy,
but I think in a few years they can shut
[SPEAKER_00]: the door again on us if they want,
if they give it all to the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that, um, kind of brings
us to the end of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, was there any shout outs or
general comments you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine those, uh, this was,
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is good to talk to you and
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, everyone needs to keep their
eye out for, I think you said early next
[SPEAKER_02]: year, they'll be able to get their hands
on some chem crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, that's, that's, that's
definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of just something I'm finding
along the way onto the end goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the thing that the vision is,
is when I, when the release happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be four or five decent
hybrids, uh, with strains that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: already probably in love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and then what I crossed with the
chem dog male that I've developed that I
[SPEAKER_00]: really feel like I can stand behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much what it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, uh, yeah, I think, I think that,
you know, things have sped up a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I got into this a little late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to do some of these things a
little late and, uh, and I got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I jumped ahead a little further
with some bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, maybe January or February.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might actually have some
December at the earliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I was hoping for December.
[SPEAKER_00]: December at the Emerald cup in Sonoma
County, but, uh, we'll see probably
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime early next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everyone needs to keep their eyes
out there for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, just thank you so much for
taking the time to come on the podcast and
[SPEAKER_02]: chat with us.
