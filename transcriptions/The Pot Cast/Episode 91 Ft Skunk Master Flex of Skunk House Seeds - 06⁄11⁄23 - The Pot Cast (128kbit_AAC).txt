satisfied, with the end product,
[SPEAKER_02]: hit them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll make it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only stock the highest quality
breeders and I know they got some fire
[SPEAKER_02]: packs from your boy, Heavy Days,

weeks, providing you with sustained spider
[SPEAKER_02]: mite control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you don't have to spread carrier
material through your garden just to
[SPEAKER_02]: introduce predator mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hang the sachets on your crop,
let the persimilus walk out and do the
[SPEAKER_02]: work for you.

[SPEAKER_02]: far, the GMO, some plans for the future,
and so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without further delay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty gang, a big thank you for joining
us for another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: On our episode today, we are joined by the
man behind Skunk House Seeds, a name
[SPEAKER_02]: you're all familiar with, the man who
found the GMO, creator of Mike,
[SPEAKER_02]: Larry, so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big welcome to Skunk Master Flex for
joining us on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about what you're
smoking on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always got some jars of some OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always got some GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always had my version of GMO, the burger
wines, TKO, a little bit of modified
[SPEAKER_00]: banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of the classics I like to
keep around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Kush fan, big OG fan, so I always have
to have a good jar of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making my mouth water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like an all-star lineup you just
read off there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we jump into some of the more newer
wines, I'd love to quickly touch on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Bubba doesn't get as much of a
mention as it used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a fan of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan of Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really, really like the high from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really relaxing guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been a favorite since the
first day I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make its rounds anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't really using it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the older guys,
I mean, I see a CSI and a couple of guys
[SPEAKER_00]: still working with Bubba Kush,
but definitely not as popular as it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of upsetting, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think the main criticism I hear
of Bubba is that it's a slow vegger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the question is, do you think
that's the predominant reason for the
[SPEAKER_02]: decline or do you think there's other sort
of types of high that have replaced it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a little bit of a vibration
really, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a slow vegger, but so is Urkel and
so are a lot of other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on a production standpoint,
the prices of cannabis in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States right now, I mean, I don't think
people are doing it to scale, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: on a personal garden, I always have a
couple in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's just not as popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are going for these new
designer strings, these hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativas I'm even seeing starting to pop up
more than they were in the early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows where it's going to be now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you just quickly mentioned it,
so I'd love to touch on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sit on Sativas versus
Indicas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think if a lot of people looked
at your catalogue of work, they'd see a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of Indica work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a soft spot for Sativas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a Sativa guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For just medicinal purposes myself,
I'm a heavy Indica smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativas give me anxiety sometimes,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi gave me a cut of temple haze years
ago and it was like my first entry to like
[SPEAKER_00]: a full blown Sativa that was like super
racy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like drew it out, got all excited,
rolled up the first joint of it and took
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe a quarter of it down and like
wanted to crawl out of my own skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just too much for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to work with some though,
because I do appreciate that people do
[SPEAKER_00]: like Sativas, but yeah, on a personal
level, it's just not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I think most people can relate to,
you know, indulging in some Sativa and
[SPEAKER_02]: going a little too far, feeling a bit like
yourself there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, out of curiosity, have you ever
had any requests to breed with Sativas?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Super Silver Haze is having a
bit of a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever get any requests to do any
hybrids with things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Super Silver Haze is a classic,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like this 45 50 day Fino like a
decade ago that I use in some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of got overshadowed by
everything else, you know, but I do agree
[SPEAKER_00]: that Sativas are kind of like,
you know, hot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people requesting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't really, you know,
dipped my toe into that Sativa world
[SPEAKER_00]: really and gotten to appreciate it because
I don't, you know, for my personal use,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for other people, I mean, yeah,
obviously as a breeder, you want to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: things in your catalog for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely some Sativa work coming down
the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this might seem like a silly
question to you, but I've actually heard a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people discuss this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we delve into, you know,
the rabbit hole that is the GMO,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to just quickly ask you the
preface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you understand what people say when you
maybe sometimes hear people say that they
[SPEAKER_02]: feel GMO is a Sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about GMO that's tricky that I
think a lot of people caught in on is the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time taken to flower that plant
to get it to completion where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually fully matured.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take it early, it can get racy,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper GMO is like close to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, if you're talking about,
you know, somebody maybe running it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial scale, maybe trying to stay in
the nine week, 60, 63 day range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had racy batches that I've
taken down early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, my sweet spot for the GMO is like
80 to 83 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't put me down to sleep,
but I don't get any of that Sativa out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, you know, that's a personal
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's again, you know, I'm not a Sativa
really smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where my sweet spot is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, what part of the genetics do
you think it is that leads it to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: what most people would consider to be
quite like a longer flowering time than
[SPEAKER_02]: what you might expect from the parents on
paper?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any idea where that might be coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, you know, I've had this
conversation with a lot of people over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years and there was mentions about maybe
something got mixed up in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not what it's, you know,
it's not Kendi crossed with form cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's, you know, maybe a sneeze
seed stuck in the bag that I got was
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, I mean, it was completely
different than the rest of the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that I popped out of that bag of
seed that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was the standout the entire
time from sprouting the seed in a solo cup
[SPEAKER_00]: to transplanting it to everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant grew, finished, looked
completely different than everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: in that, in that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if it,
if it might be something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, who's to say, you know,
that whole chem lineage is so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, unknown really, that maybe it's
something in the back genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a grandparent coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows, you know, so hard to call it,
you know, I just kind of take it for what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a, just a really unique
plant that I, I just really love to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, breed with and people seem to
love to hash and just really, really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, epic is an epic find.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about the concentrate
potential and how maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that doorway has opened up since finding
the GMO, because I know for a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, you know, GMO was a game changer
for constant trades to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has it changed your perspective on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had people walk up to me and
say, the GMO made me a millionaire,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, and it's like a,
like a big group of people, like many
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hash monster, you know,
it just dumps the type of trichome it
[SPEAKER_00]: produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put it, you know, it puts out that
sandy type of, you know, trichome and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just, it has a breeding tool for,
you know, making hash strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing, you know, especially if
you can, if you can breed it where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really see its presence as much,
but some of its attributes gets passed
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, like I said, just, just an epic
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, like, I think one of the
comments I've specifically heard a lot is
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, the, the terpene profile,
it really translates to the end product of
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, you know, not every strain
does that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your plans in terms of breeding
concentrates going forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something you actively think about,
or is it just a peripheral thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, if the genetics
facilitate a good plant, then like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these days you have to basically
breed for part of the intent to be
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate market is just so big
between, you know, people making these
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin and resin pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the demand for hashers is so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to breed and not take that
consideration would be a major mistake in
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the majority, the bulk of the
work that I do has, you know, small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts, at least of GMO in the lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any cross really, if you really do a
proper hunt, you can come across
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know, that'll just dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, amazing and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO does tend to be dominant in
genetic crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found like, if you kind of like knock
it down to where it's like 25% of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pedigree, you can really start finding
some amazing things that don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated by it, but just offer,
you know, their own, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: unique twists that are just, you know,
amazing and yield and dump and just taste
[SPEAKER_00]: great and have unique turf profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of the work that I do,
you know, it's, it is for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily the GMO kind of definitely
assists in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I think we may as well jump into the
discussion now because we're really,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're really basically started it,
but I just wanted to ask one last,
[SPEAKER_02]: one last quick question, which is I,
um, I, I got given a bud of a GMO from
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Dunn last year at one of the events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to be honest, it was,
it was so putrid smelling in a good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't know if I can smoke
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever had any experiences like
that where it was like a little too gnarly
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're like, this is, this is full on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, so when, when I first started
doing a productions of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously this is pre-medical,
at least, you know, we weren't doing
[SPEAKER_00]: medical grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a, you know, kind of a black
market grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to move a bunch of the,
you know, pounds and go from city to city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just so gnarly smelling,
you know, my buddy that was helping me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, move a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had this, uh, this two door Cadillac
and, uh, we always threw a bunch in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trunk and drove to Ann Arbor, which was
the first place that we were kind of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: drops at, um, tree city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we moved so much weight in that
trunk that it permanently stained his car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just never came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to, you know, they had to send it
out to, I think it was like Dubai or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, or Lebanon or some,
some other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to, just to get rid of it,
you know, anybody that sat in the thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the used car lot was like, man,
this thing smells terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just couldn't get the smell out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it definitely has a staining
attribute to it and it's putrid and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people just absolutely hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, I get, you know,
you know, everybody has their own,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, preferred flavors for cannabis,
but, um, it's, it's almost unbearable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that kind of fascinating and
hilarious at the same time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's just from the first batches of
it, it was just, like I said, like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a standout, it was unique, lots of
opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you said, you know,
you got, got a bud and it was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: so, so, so offensive that you didn't want
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think that's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, another sort of comment slash
observation I'd heard is that you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO really illustrates the point that,
you know, with just, I guess I'll have to
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of paint in broad swathes here,
but like a lot of males in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: are really attracted to the most acrid,
offensive, off-putting sort of smells you
[SPEAKER_02]: get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And GMO really highlights that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you, you find that
some of the females are really not that
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in that sort of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, have you ever noticed this
yourself that it's like, it's like a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: grotesque and some, some people are just
inherently really into it and others are
[SPEAKER_02]: just like not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, now that you kind of,
you know, mention it, it's, it is kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys definitely tend to draw themselves
toward the, they want the funkiest lead,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the females that I smoke
with or have in the past typically tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: like fruity genetics, things that aren't
as offensive, you know, like the Urkels
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously not exclusively, but like you
said, it's, it's definitely guys like
[SPEAKER_00]: stank weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, I'll, I'll put it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm a fruity guy myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that say about me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little feminine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I like, I like fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like fruity too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I like, if I have my fruit in
there, I have to have some gas to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something that kind of like
makes it not just fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but, uh, you know,
I, I like to get some, uh, purple punch
[SPEAKER_00]: every once in a while and, you know,
just something that tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't necessarily like get you
fucking annihilated, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just enjoyable smoke, good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's, let's dive into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about the genesis of
the GMO in the sense of what was it that
[SPEAKER_02]: drew you to those seeds and how did you
get them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, did you have a friendship with
Mimico?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just happen to find yourself with
those seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it all go down initially?
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially Mimico was not even mentioned
at all in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you gotta go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like 2012, 2011, 2012 THC Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm a moderator on there or was
moderator on there, um, along with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Cap and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Divine Genetics was ran by Logic,
who was the owner of THC Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not sure if you're familiar or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of, lots of bad, a couple of good,
lots of bad though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, he had a bunch of seed that he
wanted tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, you know, I threw my hat in the
ring and said, sure, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, I'll run some seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see, I'll see what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, Cam D crossed with Girl
Scout Cookie Foreign Cut, uh, was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the crosses that landed in my lap,
which, um, didn't really actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: named.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until like, you know, probably years down
the road, um, did the Fino hunt,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know that he was white labeling the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not until years later, um,
like years and probably almost five years
[SPEAKER_00]: later, did we find out that Mimico made,
uh, the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, as soon as he, as soon as we
think, you know, a lot of us figured it
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you definitely got credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logic was kind of keeping that like tucked
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't really letting anybody know
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it was kind of news, you know,
to our ears, but yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the seeds wound up because they were,
they were tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you really got them truly early on
in the picture, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I think, I believe it was
like 2012 was when I got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino hunted them right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Fino hunted all the seeds that he gave
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the years, uh, ran into
other people that wound up buying the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds after they had been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they, they shot me the seeds that
they had left and everybody was convinced
[SPEAKER_00]: that just, you know, it's whatever was
going to get tapped out of there was
[SPEAKER_00]: tapped out of there and the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a couple others,
um, honorable mentions that I found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the GMO was definitely the
standout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a root beer Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy used to say, smell like root
beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a, it was a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a stout plant, completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a bunch of weird stuff that
popped up in there, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, nothing, nothing that was
anything close to GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a quick little digression, have you
ever spoke to a mean gene about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's almost coincidental that he's
done some pairings with his root beer in
[SPEAKER_02]: the GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought maybe, maybe you'd spoke about
that with him and he thought, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pair them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: No big fan of his though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, love his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally haven't really had much
interaction with him, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that GMO across with his root beer
BX one or whatever it was that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, love to try those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't had the chance, but yeah,
I saw it and it was very interested,
[SPEAKER_00]: very intrigued in what he was doing with
that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some synchronous stuff right there
that, you know, you sort of got a Fino
[SPEAKER_02]: like that and he's sort of paired them
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we loop back to the story,
I guess the question is you mentioned a
[SPEAKER_02]: little earlier that, you know,
even during that first run you flowered
[SPEAKER_02]: him out, you could tell this was something
a bit different to the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, did you like,
you know, you've acknowledged you realized
[SPEAKER_02]: it was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you realize like how special it was?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess let's say when you had the
first or second batch of flower from it,
[SPEAKER_02]: what was like the public slash your
friends responses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they realize what it was or did it
take some time to catch on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that Fino actually went down in
the basement of the house that I lived in
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I used a couple of
carbon filters, but that thing was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter destroyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one plant that I had the first,
during the Fino hunt, I mean, I had
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies that came over the house and you
know, we're like, dude, your house like
[SPEAKER_00]: stinks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's worse than it usually is,
you know, like what, what do you got going
[SPEAKER_00]: on down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got something different,
like what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I showed, I showed it off a
little bit in the, in the testing phases
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody said the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just like, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A stack on that thing is throwing out like
baseball bats, you know, like never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was just a unique plant,
like from day one, you know, it's just so
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous and just, it stood out always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we didn't really find out how
well of a hasher it really even was until,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I did, you know, larger rooms and we
kind of like started processing it like by
[SPEAKER_00]: itself and the numbers that we were
getting back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, Holy cow, the hell is
going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers are nothing like what,
you know, anything else we're running.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the question then becomes,
was it like a linear progression?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it like everyone you showed it to is
interested in, it was just building in
[SPEAKER_02]: popularity or did it take a little bit of
time for it to really start to spread like
[SPEAKER_02]: wildfire?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause at a certain point it obviously hit
critical mass and just exploded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just wondering when was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fino hunted kind of started to scale it
up a little bit, realized it was something
[SPEAKER_00]: special and it could yield and we could
use it for hash making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the name itself was kind of a big deal
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the first places, like I said,
street city and Ann Arbor, Michigan here
[SPEAKER_00]: that we would drop it at, uh, when we
first dropped it, it didn't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sat on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody, you know, no, a lot of people
didn't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a, kind of a vegan area,
kind of a hippie area, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, the name was a turnoff for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the owner said, uh, you know,
look, would you be offended if I changed
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, if it's, uh, you know,
not going to move, I'm not just gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: you burnt here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so he said, what do you think about,
you know, everyone says it smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about calling it,
uh, garlic cookies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know, should give it a
try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did the name change and then it just
couldn't stay on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just flew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the demands grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to produce more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just kind of like was a
snowball effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just became, you know, a huge favorite
in the area amongst everybody that tried
[SPEAKER_00]: it and just, it just really started to
explode at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we just couldn't even keep up with the
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you touched on a point that
comes up in almost every website.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you Google GMO, which is, you know,
as you mentioned the name, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what, what did the name originally mean to
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does it mean now if that's
changed at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: So GMO to me was just like referring to
it's like how just wild it grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like how, how strong it was,
you know, like it grew at three times the
[SPEAKER_00]: speed and badge that anything else did
that I had in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just how it threw out these huge
baseball bats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm like, this thing's got to be
like, you know, genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I started kind of giving it the
nickname GMO, you know, it's like joking
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this thing is, you know, kind of a
force of its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also coincidentally at the time,
the Girl Scout, uh, cookies were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, a bunch of press in the
news for putting GMOs, um, in their,
[SPEAKER_00]: in their baked goods and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just kind of like, I don't know,
the universe telling me to just call it
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is actually kind of ironic
because, um, it logic was completely
[SPEAKER_00]: against and like forbid me to call it GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years down the road put out GMO
seeds, which is just, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I find kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made him backflip on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I guess as a, how would you
phrase it?
[SPEAKER_02]: A question that people are probably
wondering and I certainly am is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, given the dominant Chem D
profile within the GMO, what's your
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts on the Chem D and the Chem dogs
in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the chems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the chems are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like them on a personal level to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them to use in genetic breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them to just grow for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think the Chem D is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, probably my favorite chem at least to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the Chem 91, but the whole chem
line itself, man is just, it's so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, epic in genetic crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to not like chem would be insane
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I was probably meant to slot
this in just the prior question,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just to a hundred percent rule it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on when people say
that GMO stands for garlic, mushroom,
[SPEAKER_02]: onion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think like, oh, it's just a funny
coincidence and it's sort of works out or
[SPEAKER_02]: is it just like, nah, it's definitely not
anything related to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just funny coincidence and
kind of works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people get garlic smell in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people get onion smell in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it just kind of smells scum key,
you know, um, definitely not what I
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally, you know, put the GMO,
you know, out there for as an acronym,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, I think it's cool hearing the
stories of people kind of like going in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own direction with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably one of the most asked
questions I ever get is just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: did the GMOs, you know, stand for this or
me and my buddies are having a debate and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I bet him that it stood for this
or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a good time with it,
you know, the cannabis community reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: out and kind of trying to get the,
the lore of the backstories of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it's, I think it's
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can call it whatever they want,
but to me, it's, it's always just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be GMO and it's just based on how it grows
and, you know, my experience with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, we've sort of touched on this,
but I just wanted to delve into the topic
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more, you know, you referenced
earlier, maybe there was some pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess my question is to me,
the GMO seems like a lottery ticket
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype in the sense that, you know,
as you've said, many people have popped
[SPEAKER_02]: those seeds and no one's really found
anything that similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the question is, do you feel that
it's like, in my mind, I guess maybe an
[SPEAKER_02]: analogy is I feel like it's kind of
similar to the Mac one, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, it's this insane cut and no
one's really been able to find anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that stands up to it while hunting those
same seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you think about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you lean more towards the
possibility of pollen contamination as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to like, this is just the one
phenome where we really lucked out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think in my opinion,
I think it's just something in the back
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that came out and popped out for
one random seed to pop in there and just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like be that much of a game
changer would just be, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: to me, it just not as not as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything to me just leans toward just
the chem is just awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just it was just a freak phenome that
came out and, you know, kind of made its
[SPEAKER_00]: way and just it was meant to be kind of
thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our group kind of held it in our little
circle for a while, but we just felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: really the world needed to really enjoy
it, you know, get out there and make some
[SPEAKER_00]: people's gardens happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever made or ran any S1s from it
and found anything interesting in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issue with the GMO when you start
doing S1s and reversing it is obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic fucking, you know,
tendencies it wants to throw pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: the lowers from seed doesn't necessarily
stay in the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like I've done some S1s and I've
cloned them before I ran the seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't run the straight seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have the issues, but like,
you know, as a breeder, you can't rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: people to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always kind of like steered away
from putting out S1s and doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: fem work in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that fems are always going to be,
you know, herm issues, but something about
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just had issues with it with fem
seeds, not so much being the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being the donor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess the flip side of that
question is what sort of genetics do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think the GMO pairs well with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put it with stuff that kind of,
you know, stays shorter, stays a little
[SPEAKER_00]: squatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I love OG Kush and pairing it
with OG when I, when I did the Han Solo
[SPEAKER_00]: burger was just amazing, you know,
but I'm a big gas fan and I like that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did some, I did some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some Urkel crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an Obama Kush cross with the BX,
the Donnie burger, which is a GMO BX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those phenos came out just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to pair it with stuff
that it's kind of like opposite of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it already has that funkiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already has that, that wild stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to pair it with something that's,
you know, kind of fruity or kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: stout and, you know, has attributes that
kind of like, mellow it out with the
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch and everything I found to be the
most beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess an extension of that is what
sort of traits are you looking to improve?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess if you had to, you know,
be critical, what do you think could be
[SPEAKER_02]: better?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, everybody's, everyone's
complaining to GMO as it takes too long to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I agree with, you know, it does,
it does take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of negates the commercial
standpoint of it, though you can run it
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, most people nowadays because of
how the industry is, they want to run like
[SPEAKER_00]: nine weeks and proper GMO just can't go
nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you, when you breed with it or use
as a tool, your main, at least my main
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is to shorten flower times,
which I've, you know, I've been able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: and still be able to pull a lot of that
funk, a lot of those things that people
[SPEAKER_00]: love about GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, people just don't have the
patience to run 90 days, 85 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely the time got to knock that
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stretch, some people have an issue
with it that have shorter ceilings or more
[SPEAKER_00]: confined space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knocking that stretch down a little bit
is, is always something that I look to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish when breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of like dense it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really like to give it things that
have foxtail tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO can kind of foxtail sometimes on
its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that can kind of like help
dense it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically flower time, flower density,
stretch, those are like the main,
[SPEAKER_00]: my main concerns whenever I use it as a
tool for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really keen to jump into some of
the Donnie burger, Han solid burger,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get there, I just want to
quickly ask you, I read an interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: comment by a good friend of the show,
Dire Wolf.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a well-known Canadian grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made a comment a few weeks ago that
sort of stuck with me, which was,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paraphrasing, but essentially he said,
you know, GMO has done more for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian cannabis scene than any other
strain since Brita Steve's sweet skunk,
[SPEAKER_02]: which obviously, you know, made a big
splash many years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard sentiments to this effect
and how does it feel to be associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: a strain that's had such far reaching
impacts in a place like Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, you know, well-known cannabis
producer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's amazing that I was able to be
part of that and just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I didn't read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just selected, I just found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still the person that bought the
lottery ticket that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit a jackpot, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being a part of that and being able to
share that and hearing people's stories
[SPEAKER_00]: about how it's changed the industry in
such a positive way, especially like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said, you know, these, these guys that are
big hashers and make a lot of rosin and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all these concentrates and just
hearing their stories about just how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: changed their lives financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like, personally, it's just,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so proud and happy to be a part of
that and just be part of the story,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just to be somebody that
contributed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just fills me with joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, humble man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's jump in to some more breeding
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before that, take me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about your first experience with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started smoking at a young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I smoked, I knew that it
was going to be something important in my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just like had this old on me where it
was really calming and it just went along
[SPEAKER_00]: with a certain type of lifestyle that I
knew I wanted to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just haven't really put it down
since, you know, except for a short little
[SPEAKER_00]: period with the court system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, it's just been a
constant in my life, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I feel like it's just
changed me for the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome to hear that you had that
connection with it so early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you first started smoking,
was this at a timeframe when like there
[SPEAKER_02]: were stray names or was it before that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you remember the sort of effects
you were feeling when you were first
[SPEAKER_02]: starting smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'm decently old, not super old in
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the peers, like,
you know, all the breeders and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm in my late thirties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the peak, I guess, when I started was
like 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99, you know, we weren't really getting
genetics that had like full on names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would come around every once in a
while, but the area that I'm at wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really like a cannabis capital here in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would get stuff like Northern Lights
every once in a while from like older
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers, some skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk was really big in Michigan here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could get your hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of years, maybe into smoking,
we started to see some of my buddies,
[SPEAKER_00]: like older brothers and stuff started
doing little classic grows and go to like
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and bring back seed and some of
the, some of the early sensi stuff and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and serious seed stuff, like AK 47 and
sensi star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being just like amazing where
it was just like, once you got your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on that, you're like, I'm not,
I'm not smoking this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: off brand, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is, this is all I want now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, it's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, unique and the highs
are different and they're exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just early on, you know,
it's just, we didn't have what people have
[SPEAKER_00]: now with this variety and accessibility,
you know, I'm sure that you can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how available genetics are
there in Australia, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's to grow up in an era where you
had to seek really good weed and it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: always available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to have what we have now here,
where you can just walk into a store and
[SPEAKER_00]: pick off of a menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how times have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paradigm shift for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess then I'm interested to know
what was the progression from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, having the first few encounters
with it, realizing this is something
[SPEAKER_02]: you're highly into to them progressing to
your first grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you were growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to Jamaica on a trip and got to
tour some really cool ganja fields out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, found some seeds and some buds,
uh, brought them back for finally brought
[SPEAKER_00]: them back and, uh, built this little box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just did my first grow with the
400 light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like, I didn't even think
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just came naturally, or it was just
like, you know, nothing that anybody I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew was doing at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was, no one was growing any
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, you know, 18 years old and it was
just something that people weren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't even like gross supply stores
you could walk into and just openly talk
[SPEAKER_00]: like you can now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it was like, you know, it was kind
of difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, internet wasn't even
something that, you know, people were
[SPEAKER_00]: really much using at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, just starting to get
where, you know, forums were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting formed and people were talking
about it openly, like on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a lot more difficult to
start back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was, the progression was,
was constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that naturally I
wanted to get involved in and seek out
[SPEAKER_00]: other people that were doing the same
thing, like-minded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of led me to like ICMAG and,
you know, THC farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like that, um, where I could
just interact with other people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the same stuff and were,
could relate to what I was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish and give me ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could just kind of like feed off
of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was a unique thing to
experience, um, growing flower when nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: else in the area did, you know,
now it's, you know, everybody's involved
[SPEAKER_00]: some way in either cultivation or cannabis
and.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't the case back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's a cannabis consultant these
days, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me what was the first plant you
grew where like, it was like a standout,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I remember the, I remember when
I first started growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the plants were pretty midsy and
it was mostly because of my skill,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do remember a plant, you know,
tolerating my, my horrible growth styles
[SPEAKER_02]: and still producing a nice sort of crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, Oh, some plants produce
really good bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that moment like for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing with this group of guys
in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing warehouse grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they had already developed their own
kind of tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went along with, um, they were growing
this strain that we just called the perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the same as the seed bank perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what I was told years later was
something called green cross or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of, you know, hilarious
considering it was pure purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, they were doing like one gallon
pots, like 40 of them per four by four,
[SPEAKER_00]: just packed side by side, growing like
single colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew if I had gotten my hands on it,
that I could kind of develop a better
[SPEAKER_00]: method and grow it more efficiently and
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did not that it was like,
you know, a game changer, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, just doing a Scrog just one
gallons was just not, not the method,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was my first like obtained clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like something special that I
could do, you know, different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: grows with and kind of like documented and
kind of figure it out and play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, screen grows and,
you know, DWC grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, you know, hydroponics and all
that stuff, you know, first kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got introduced to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unique seeing the differences,
but I wanted being a soil grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: stayed with organic soil for, for a lot of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that's pretty much where I stayed
for a long time until I switched over to
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa and I didn't switch over to cocoa
until like, you know, maybe, maybe four
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago or five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that, that one per that one
purple strain was definitely the one early
[SPEAKER_00]: on that kind of changed the game for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open some doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you remember in those early years,
I think a lot of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we ended up getting these seed addictions
and we ended up buying lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of stuff were you buying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was buying everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds were like my, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like my drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just, anytime that seed drops
would happen and I was following them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I had to, I, I still to this day
have seeds that I bought like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 15 plus years ago that are just
sitting in the refrigerator that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: never did anything with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, uh, it was like a habit,
you know, it's like, gotta have these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, these are going to be the,
these are going to be the great ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, some of them we touched and
got into some of them are still sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there and just waiting to be messed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go down memory lane every once
in a while and open up the fridge and go
[SPEAKER_00]: through all the containers of seeds that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I was, I was buying a,
you know, the earlier days I was getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of like sensey seed stuff and,
you know, uh, serious seeds, flying
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutchman, you know, I was getting stuff
over from like Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, once the forum days kind of
started, you know, these, this OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of wave started and you're just
looking for things that have like OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: in them or, you know, Baba Kush in them or
any of the KEMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're lucky enough to get anything
with KEM in it, you know, um, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole just buying seeds in bulk thing was
just kind of like why I started making my
[SPEAKER_00]: own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was just, I was finding not great
representation of what I was really
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of like mentally put me in this
position where I'm like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to, I need to start doing some
creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get my, get my hand in some of
this genetic stuff and, uh, kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: changed, you know, me buying seed to
trading seed and kind of things kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: went in a different directions from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first endeavor with
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing around with male plants,
kind of trying to, you know, understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how dropping pound and what kind
of traits, you know, plants put out or
[SPEAKER_00]: gave, you know, looking for indicators,
stem rub and, you know, stressing out
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to kind of play with them,
see what it made it do and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: starve them out or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them water for a little while
and kind of drought them out and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of expressions come out with them and
see if they, you know, makes them drop
[SPEAKER_00]: pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my whole thing,
my whole breeding experience is all,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all based on trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll make things and,
and they'll be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll make things and they're fucking
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's like, it's all just
like a constant learning experience for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, you know, there's a big
learning curve to the whole breeding thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and just growing in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow unless you have failure and
just breeding even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, like I've been working,
I worked a Larry line, still working the
[SPEAKER_00]: same Larry line for like 10 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had certain generations that I,
you know, made and, and went back because
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't, I wasn't happy with how,
you know, the offspring was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, even to this day, I still make
plenty of error, like constant error,
[SPEAKER_00]: but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I pride myself in, you know,
when I have success in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's, it would be naive to
think that everything that is ever made
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is going to be, you know, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you touched on the, the Larry,
and that was certainly something I was
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping for us to delve into, you know,
I wanted to first off start by asking,
[SPEAKER_02]: where did the passion for the Larry OG
come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of the passion came from it
being the only OG I could get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of wanted to be in the leading
horse there in the, in the race,
[SPEAKER_00]: but luckily, I mean, the Larry is epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's a great OG coach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wish I still had the original cut
of Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be thrilled to have the original
Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much worked it into a solid seed
and something like basically spot on or
[SPEAKER_00]: close to pops up on a regular basis for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was definitely, like, you know,
it was my first dealings with OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first genetic that I got in physical
form of a clone of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just loved the plant so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was lucky enough to get
it and have a real version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of just like made it a no
brainer for me, like that it was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be something that I worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early on in the game, I was blessed
enough to kind of get to know elite
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and he was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also a big Larry fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had worked something that he was
calling the lemon Larry, which was Larry
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush crossed with sour diesel IDL from
res seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed me some of the seeds to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to do like a little BX
across the mail that I found from his seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stack to the Larry clone only making the
first BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just worked, you know,
F gens from that point on and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, finished up F tens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm still going to continue
to work the line until, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just probably forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such a great line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outcrosses that I've made from it,
people have loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that's special to me
as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I put a lot of time and work
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll probably always continue to align
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I read on your website that you'd sort
of, you know, briefly discuss this
[SPEAKER_02]: experience where you got to try this
legendary OG while you're on Venice Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that was the Larry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was probably just the
original OG grown really well by somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: there in Southern California.
I've.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown the original just briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I just got it back from Josh and I
are actually working on a collab project
[SPEAKER_00]: together, an OG project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be cool to see how the
original, which I think is what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: calling the Venice OG grown locally in the
area of Venice at the time, how that grows
[SPEAKER_00]: and in contrast to, you know, being hit
with the Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I've worked on for so long and seeing
what kind of expressions come out of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of phenoms I can find and just
kind of lines that we can work together
[SPEAKER_00]: from all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I'm really, really,
really excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, definitely shout out Josh D,
just a lovely guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh is the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've met him two or three times in
person when I've been in the States and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's always been such a lovely,
you know, just really easy to talk to guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely shout out Josh D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a question that's more of a
personal one for me than anything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: but years ago, probably at least 10 years
ago, I tried some Larry OG that was
[SPEAKER_02]: imported bud from the States, you know,
came to Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember thinking, you know,
it had this sour lemon sort of flavor to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then years later I tried Larry OG at
Mr. Bob Hemphill's house and it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: the original OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, this isn't lemony like
the one I tried years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, as you've sort of
touched on, you hear that there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: other one, you know, this electric lemon
Larry, it's got a few different names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that is the explanation
for the experience I had?
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably just tried the electric lemon
and the original Larry OG is more like the
[SPEAKER_02]: original OG or it's like an earthy cushy,
like not really a lemon thing or any
[SPEAKER_02]: explanation for maybe how I had those two
different experiences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've gone back and forth with a
few people on this and the original is
[SPEAKER_00]: just a lot, a lot more rare than people
would think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of seed genetics that have
been created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Swerve did a Larry BX2 or something
years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those phenos that people found
were getting passed as the Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that some of the elites from Elite
Genetics, I know that some of his seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that he made of the lemon Larry were
getting tossed around as just Larry clone
[SPEAKER_00]: only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most likely, I mean, if my opinion
would be probably be one of those type of
[SPEAKER_00]: situations where if you got something that
was truly like lemony, then it was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably like had some some of that sour
diesel or something in it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of that twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does it does have like a little bit of
a more citrus than, you know, the
[SPEAKER_00]: original, but it still has that classic OG
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's not like candy coated type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a mouth coating cush that
has like that little slight like
[SPEAKER_00]: electrified kind of, you know,
little lemon to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very light, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not like the lemon Larry or the
one that Swerve did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was and I know because I've
gotten past a couple of Larry's that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown out and was like, you know,
this isn't the original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the ones from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of that going on
or was going on there for a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really see the Larry pop up at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a couple of people I've
talked to recently that have been like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, you know, wild witch hunt
for this alleged, you know, real Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, I haven't been able to,
you know, track it down myself and grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a get a real version of it.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out there somewhere, somebody has it,
but probably the difference that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing is that the one later on down the
road that you tried out that was more like
[SPEAKER_00]: the original, that was probably the real
Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones from the earlier days where
it crosses is what I would probably best
[SPEAKER_00]: guess on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that certainly makes sense in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to hear a little bit more
about your Larry OG line and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: specifics about it, because we did have
some fans submitted questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess one of the obvious things that
jumps out to most people is that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: bred a number of filial generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as you mentioned up to the F10.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is what sort of traits were
you looking to preserve and what sort,
[SPEAKER_02]: how would you describe the plants that
you'd get from that line in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: the seed line as opposed to the clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was really trying to do is just
kind of capture the original into seed
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really trying to necessarily in
the beginning, add anything to it or
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen it in any ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe like subconsciously I would
select plants by structure that had better
[SPEAKER_00]: node spacing than the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original has a little bit of
lengthiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I was doing a little bit of that
subconsciously, but it was really trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to just lock down the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a case down the road,
I kind of lost it, which is exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could kind of like pop seed and just
kind of start over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely think that some of the
generations that I ran through,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the sour popped up in,
and I would get phenos that ranged almost
[SPEAKER_00]: on the diesel side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The F6s that I made, I got a lot of sour
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even some like purpling that came in,
which was kind of different than some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the F7s were the ones that I started
doing out-cross breeding with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The F8s were more public ones that I did
drops with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I said, it's probably really
just like the goal was to get that and
[SPEAKER_00]: just lock it in in seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you say that in general you feel
like you've been able to do that or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like each generation sort of
represents the clone in a slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: different way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've been able to do it for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's certain generations that I
favor just because I like how they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last ones, the last two,
the F8s were pretty locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a whole lot of variation
really at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any solvers that came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The F9s were just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were straight OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant looked very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no massive nug phenos or no sour
phenos or nothing weird that was popping
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was real uniform, as it should be,
that far worked down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's surprising even when you inbreed
some stuff that far, you get some things
[SPEAKER_00]: that pop up every once in a while,
especially if you're popping enough seed
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking through things properly,
some of the back genetics that will come
[SPEAKER_00]: up in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at this point, it's just keeping
the gene alive and kind of preserving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I'm trying to accomplish
anything more at this point with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the outcrofts are really what really
excite me about that, Larry and I look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to what that can mix with the
whole Josh collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an honor to be a part of the OG
Kush thing and trying to make my way with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, like I did with the GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you just sort of touched on it
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the first outcross you did with
it that really got you excited?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a Chem 4 cross with Larry OG and
that was just so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it drew different types of chems in
the phenos that were ranging from just
[SPEAKER_00]: huge flowering plants just covered in
resin to just gas and just it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chems and the OGs mesh very well
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some other OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the TK and crossed it with Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Louis, a lot of the OGs that were
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought, you know, like what could
go wrong mixing an OG with an OG and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them didn't do as well as the
other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, lots of exciting stuff when you
work with those, you know, types of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, the Kush's and the Bubblers and
that stuff, what kind of pops out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, in general, would you say
there's a certain type of plant that your
[SPEAKER_02]: Larry line pairs well with or is it more
of like a case by case basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of case by case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I obviously like tend to
want to breed with plants that I enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I've done a bunch of work
with Bubblers and Urkels and Grape Ape
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, some of this, some of the
older classics, you know, and I'm glad I
[SPEAKER_00]: did because some of them I don't even have
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't say it necessarily pairs
better with some, but I did do early on
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Silver Haze Cross and it did not
really pair well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fino's kind of like we're all over the
place and I just didn't really find
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that I really enjoyed and wanted
to keep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess as a general question,
you know, when we talk to breeders,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we often talk about the crosses
that work, but you interestingly have
[SPEAKER_02]: touched on a topic we sometimes discuss,
which is that sometimes crosses don't
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess as a general sort of
discussion, you know, how often do you
[SPEAKER_02]: find that's the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that most of the time crosses
work and it's only rarely you have to sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of be like, you know what, this one didn't
quite work out or is it a bit more even
[SPEAKER_02]: across the board?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I gauge what I'm going to drop to
people and release and offer publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: based on my testing experiences with the
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, sometimes I'll run 20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll run, you know, a hundred
seeds, depending on the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some things just don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I have a huge stock of things
that I'll never release because I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: find them to be good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I'll never revisit some
things, you know, like there's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a lesson learned just super
scum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a couple of super scum crosses with
the Larry, didn't enjoy any of those years
[SPEAKER_00]: back when I still had the mass super scum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants, just the structure on them
just was not like desirable at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like from a grower standpoint,
cultivating them, they were just branches
[SPEAKER_00]: flopping all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just wasn't something I would,
I would ever, you know, pass out even for
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just, just a waste of time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I've, I've definitely had
plenty of trial and error and plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: error, which is kind of like, you know,
obviously helped with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: success because I know what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's, there's definitely
plenty of crosses that went bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to steal that phrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've trialed an error and I've
also just had there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the mass super skunk,
you know, recently we've had a few
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes sort of with discussions around
that featuring skunk VA and Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe the mass super
skunk you were familiar with?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't so much like on the rotten,
skunky kind of side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't sweet either, but it just,
it tasted really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a really good terpene profile to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yielded really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of grew in like this kind of crazy
bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen that plant in probably a
decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably been about 10 years since
I've had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's, it's, you know,
it's not what people think of when they
[SPEAKER_00]: think of like a roadkill or something like
that, but it was a unique one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fun one to play around with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see where, I can see like where the
diesel and some of that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I can see the relation in
that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you ever been in search for the
roadkill like some are, or has it not
[SPEAKER_02]: quite piqued your curiosity in the same
way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, being from Michigan, we used to
have tons of roadkill skunk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like what I grew up
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I got good flowers, I just,
I have not been able to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's, I haven't like gone
out of my way, like in a crazy way to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to find it, but it's not something that I
think is kind of just like floating around
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe, maybe some old heads kind
of keeping it close maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I've had discussions with a
lot of people in the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's kind of like leaning toward the
same thing as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, maybe that phenotype has been
kind of like isolated away or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just people didn't find it desirable
for a period of time when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing wasn't legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people were worried about,
you know, smell issues and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of maybe just kind of faded and
took like a backseat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's around somewhere,
because I know that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people would just love to have that in
seed form and have somebody that's working
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's something I think is
kind of rare now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it in years, probably 2004,
2005, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was your recollection of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, some of the more modern
accounts we get from people who are really
[SPEAKER_02]: on the search for it, they'll say,
oh, you know, I found something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of similar, but potency is really not
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember it as a potent strain or
was this back in the time where,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, weed was scarce and so maybe
tolerances were a bit lower?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I guess maybe if I distill
this question down, do you think it is
[SPEAKER_02]: that mythical hype thing that some people
make it out to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think there's an element of like
reminiscent rose shade sort of glasses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I'm being honest, I think it's
like a reminiscent thing where it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're you have this concept or this
idea of something that really wasn't what
[SPEAKER_00]: it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that skunk smell was
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember like smoking a joint and just
reeking to high hell of skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just like would not come out of
your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like if you had like a gram or a
couple grams in a little baggie that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when somebody walked into a room,
you know, they had the skunk on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just stuck to the sandwich bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resonance, funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that the high was
probably incredibly like earth shattering
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to some of the stuff that's
available now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that part of it's kind of like
mythical in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: My tolerance was not incredible then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been experienced at that point a
bunch of different kinds of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: what cannabis really had to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, it was shattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was wreck your world type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in comparison to, you know,
what something that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 percent or 12 percent or something,
you know, like it's in a world of lab
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and all this stuff that,
you know, everybody's so concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: THC content, percentages and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that it would be something
that wouldn't basically like dominate
[SPEAKER_00]: records.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it was just good at that
time because it's what was available and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the best of it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that correlates with some of the
accounts I've heard from other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You touched on a number of really
interesting talking points in that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would love to touch on a few of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first being, you know,
the THC percentage predicament,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a bit of a tongue tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's like a bit of a
common sentiment in the community that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're too dominated by THC
percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess more specifically,
there's this push that we need to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: educate consumers to to not focus on it so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the question is, do you think it's
possible to do this or do you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: the general consumer is going to follow
numbers to an extent?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really like the hardcore
community like that yourself and I exist
[SPEAKER_02]: in that, you know, have the luxury of sort
of being like, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: THC percentages aren't everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like wholeheartedly, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's when I when I go into a
dispensary, not that I do it often and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but if I go into I'm not
worried, I'm not looking at THC content
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want, you know, I want to experience
something other than what I have in my
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't base what I what I buy or what
I grow on THC content, but I do also as a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed maker, realize that people do get
seeds and they want high testing THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really like this place in the
market and in the industry right now where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's like you're damned if you do and
you're damned if you don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to produce things that are going
to have high test scores, because at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day, you still have to give the
people what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also fighting like the
ignorance of saying like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The content doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lab test doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it it's a weird point right now that
we're at, where I think that that dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: will shift and people will start to just
appreciate flowers again, because they can
[SPEAKER_00]: just go get wax or go get oil if they want
to get wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that whole thing is going
to kind of change soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of seeing it where people are
kind of like more interested in terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles and, you know, basically those
kind of lab tests where it's like what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of active flavors are you going to
get out of the flowers as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the THC content?
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a breeder, it really puts you in a
really hard place where it's like you just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of want to, you know, mess around
with with things and make something
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like you're kind of also like
forced to kind of like kowtow to this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole we need high testers thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely a definitely an issue
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird place to be in right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, another another point
that you touched on is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the roadkill skunk likely wasn't as potent
as some of the more modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there's like an element of
being reminiscent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess, you know, recently there's
been a resurgence of older genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in the context of people
looking with in them to sort of make new
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you can sort of look at
like Tom Hill's sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: been toying with his haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen Todd McCormick and Caleb
and Matt Riot do their NL5 re-releases
[SPEAKER_02]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever had any curiosity to look in
some of this older stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think it might be like a viable
path forward to blend some of that old
[SPEAKER_02]: with some of that new?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my opinion, a lot of these
current genetics used a lot of that old
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch, you know, Sensei Seabank,
you know, some of the some of those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would be foolish not to
revisit some of the older stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, especially the Northern Lights
or or this, you know, some of the skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would love to to do a bunch of
Sensei Star work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love Sensei Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like this funky, you know,
stank, gooey flower that just like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky to get my hands on and, you know,
it was getting grown locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just every time I got it,
it was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I personally love to work
with something like that or like the old
[SPEAKER_00]: AK-47.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the guys I've seen,
you know, over the past like decade or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: they they did an AK-47, a Cherry Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still wasn't what I remember it being,
but it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should always try to bring
back some of the old stuff and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like pay homage to it and give it the
respect it deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, part of the stepping stone
to where we are now is due to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm pumped to see what some of
these guys do with some of the older
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, likewise, likewise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you sort of touched on it with that
answer there, but I guess I'll throw throw
[SPEAKER_02]: it open to any other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are there any strains besides,
say, the Sensei Star that have left a
[SPEAKER_02]: lasting memory for you, but you sadly no
longer have access to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so like I have I have the Indiana
Bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Bubblegum in the late 90s,
the early 2000s was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was completely different than the
Indiana Bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could get my hands on that one,
I would love to work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bubblegum was just.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had like this like really playful,
kind of like uplifting kind of buzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't like anxiety driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of like euphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cotton Candy back in the late 90s,
early 2000s, that was a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great flavor, great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a small handful of ones that I
would I would personally put on my list
[SPEAKER_00]: there to to do a couple of projects with
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me back to earlier, we were
discussing how you were getting into
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you were growing, you were
getting your hands on these cool genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point did you officially decide to
start Skunkhouse Genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept, the idea, the name of
Skunkhouse was kind of something I threw
[SPEAKER_00]: around in the forum days when like,
you know, 07, 08.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like my tag, my sign off
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like Skunkhouse, you know,
came up with Skunkmaster Flex as a screen
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just kind of like my
little my little house, my little,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to call this Skunk Dungeon,
Skunkhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Skunkhouse Genetics was kind of just
like kind of like organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just like happened on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until I had not respect on the
forums and he was going through some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: His wife had some health issues and he was
he was in a tough spot and we kind of went
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, hey, you know,
let's let's let's drop the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's create some, you know, revenue would
really, really, you know, it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: big deal to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would really help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of launched Skunkhouse and I was,
you know, just it was a bunch of projects
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had done just breeding and I'm,
you know, with the intent of just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being basically personal work of
my own and not really being like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a seed breeder and dropping
genetics for public.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was basically how I launched
Skunkhouse was just based on his
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, you know, I'll start
Skunkhouse and he had California Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did all the vending through
California Seed Bank and that was a rock
[SPEAKER_00]: and roll history there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of the first releases and
were they the first ones to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: traction with the public or did it take a
little bit of time before the general
[SPEAKER_02]: public started to realize the quality of
the work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first releases were like 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my first drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bunch of Larry, OGF7 work,
much of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the year previous to that,
I went to the High Times Cup here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan and was just kind of like giving
out packs of seeds, you know, just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like spreading them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, you know, hunt these,
have a good time with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bunch of my buddies hunted them,
a bunch of random people that years down
[SPEAKER_00]: the road, you know, when I had a booth and
was vending seed came up and they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, you know, you gave me packs,
like just taught me packs back,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, two years ago and they
were just epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just want to support the
brand now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the original releases were the F8
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like, I did like Chem
4, Chem 91, TK, a couple of different OG
[SPEAKER_00]: cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did like the original Bubba,
the 98 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a handful of other crosses that
I made, but that was, that was our first,
[SPEAKER_00]: my first seed drop that I ever did was the
OG stuff, which was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff that came out of there
was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: People got their hands on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wanted more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I further worked with Larry Lines at
F8.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with the F8 mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when the GMO got brought in with
the Han Solo burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first GMO cross that I did
for public drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the pollen donor to make the Donnie
burger to create the VX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, that was a pretty legendary
drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got a bunch of questions about
the Donnie burger, the Han Solo burger and
[SPEAKER_02]: all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one I'd love to swing by you is
one we actually got from a listener,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was what sort of stimulated you
initially to begin the burger lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to work with the GMO because it
had such a like impact on my life that it
[SPEAKER_00]: just, it was something that I needed to do
a cross with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I did do a cross with it,
I realized the potential that it could use
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road genetically and doing
hybrids with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, isolating certain
phenotypes that just flowered shorter and
[SPEAKER_00]: just expressed things that were kind of
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it was like a gene pool that you
just kind of like rolled the dice with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, you know, let's,
let's kind of see what comes out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what kind of unique things we
can do and what we can accomplish,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was making the seed,
I didn't really realize how it passed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hash potential to other
genetics, ones that maybe necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really hash super well and how it
kind of like lended a hand to kind of give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once, once I did realize this is kind
of like a no-brainer to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're going to do, we're going
to do a GMO line and we're just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do like, you know, kind of like back cross
it a few times and then kind of work that
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of just see where it goes and
just, you know, it opened up a whole new
[SPEAKER_00]: door to things that were, were amazing
that just kind of like went their own
[SPEAKER_00]: directions, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it segues exactly into what I was
going to ask you next, which is as you
[SPEAKER_02]: progress further into the GMO back crosses
with the burger lines, was your intended
[SPEAKER_02]: process to create something that's
essentially the GMO in seed form,
[SPEAKER_02]: or were you looking to do something that
was sort of standing on its own two legs
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe representing both sides of the
lineage a little more?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when I do the straight GMO
crosses, when I do the BX two or the BX
[SPEAKER_00]: three or the BX four is I finished a
couple of months back or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a BX five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my intent with that on its own is to
definitely lock in the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like kind of alter a little bit,
you know, to kind of like isolate certain
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, certain things that I find less
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've, you know, like I've said a few
times now, like, you know, the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, but that's definitely to keep
the majority of the GMO in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do the out crosses, my main goal
with that, what I envision anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: is just using the parts of it that I like
and trying to eliminate the parts that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like and kind of let whatever female
I'm using in the cross kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: influence it more than the actual pollen
from the BX four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the BX three or any of the burger
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just, I want to bring in a
little bit of funkiness from that GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to like, you know, bring in the
stuff that, that, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking for that, you know,
they want, they want hashers, they want
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, they want, you know, stack,
they want, you know, that smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like not dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want like something else,
you know, it's like the GMO is just like
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible tool to kind of like loan.
[SPEAKER_00]: To other things to kind of like enhance
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the secret,
it's like the secret ingredient that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your grandma leaves out of the
cooking recipe that she doesn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you, you sort of touched on it,
but I did want to formally get an answer
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, what would be your sales
pitch for someone who's sort of looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: the double burger, the triple burger,
maybe even the Han Solo burger,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they get their hands on some of the
seeds, you know, how would you describe
[SPEAKER_02]: this to them in terms of what they should
expect if they run a pack of these seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect something that is completely
different than the rest of the stuff you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's going to be foul.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have, you know, kind of like
that stink, you know, that, that something
[SPEAKER_00]: different, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not a, it's not a candy,
it's not a dessert kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's like its own class,
which, you know, I, which is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe is kind of like what makes it
stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they kind of created a different
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it existed a little bit,
you know, obviously the Chem D was around
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Chem D's got that kind of funk to
it, but there wasn't like a whole category
[SPEAKER_00]: of those kinds of genetics where it's like
disgusting, foul, you know, and now you
[SPEAKER_00]: have that getting crossed with something
that smells awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, fruity and now you've
got funky fruity and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, I guess my sales pitch would be,
you know, it's just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a breath of fresh air to have
something that's not the same thing where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're agitated over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you, you sort of touch on
this idea that you mentioned in,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'd call it your slogan,
but I remembered seeing it on your website
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just says that, you know,
you've got to focus on high yields and
[SPEAKER_02]: unique terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, by virtue of what you've
just said, that stands true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the follow-up question is to what
degree do you feel like these are
[SPEAKER_02]: important factors in the current market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to be honest, we've never really
heard people talk about high yield being
[SPEAKER_02]: like a necessity or like something that
they're looking to actively breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as time goes by, I think we are seeing
an emergence of this becoming like a more
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted attribute that plants need to
have in the modern climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think like, you know, unique terps,
obviously, but high yielding, do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is something that needs to be
factored in by more people across the
[SPEAKER_02]: board to make strength?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brains more viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, I think in places where you're
seeing the price of cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bodying them out, I think that the yield
does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously not everything has to be grown
for personal smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, not everything that's
incredible yielding is going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating highs, but you need to offset
something genetically to make up for you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yield is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the most important, but it's
definitely in the top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the legal market,
or even, you know, non-legal market,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just where cannabis here in the
States has gone is just, it's gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the pricing and the availability is
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that yield is becoming more
relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people used to say that yield
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that dynamic is going to
shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already has shifted here where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, you know, commercially,
there's just some things that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: viable to grow because of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you couldn't do rooms of Urkel and
some of this Bubba and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you did, your price tag would have
to justify the fact that it yields or it
[SPEAKER_00]: veges or it takes, you know, more time and
it costs more to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of these companies are
offsetting with things that yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, that's taking some of this
burger genetic and crossing it to things
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't yield and kind of utilizing the
GMO and, you know, what it does in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial setting minus the time is,
I mean, it's a great method for success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to touch a little bit on the
Michigan scene, because it's not one we've
[SPEAKER_02]: spoken about extensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I do remember reading an article
the other day, and I might be getting this
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong, but I basically said something to
the effect that like Michigan is one of,
[SPEAKER_02]: if not the largest flower producing states
in the USA right now, which again,
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have misremembered that quote,
but regardless of whether it was the most
[SPEAKER_02]: or like still second to California or
whatever, the point remains like it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: very quickly rising star and it's it's I
shouldn't say rising star.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been doing its thing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how would you describe the state of
Michigan at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like it is having a big
surge and putting it on par with somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: like California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surge is enormous here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been to countless facilities,
done a bunch of walkthroughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, I mean, Michigan has a very
impressive cultivation department in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our cultivating here, our hash making
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just escalated so quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many companies that are
involved now and the market is just so
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated that you really have to be like
at the top of your game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just entered the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Progrow, my team over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They guys do an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you eat off the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so clean in the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on scale, like it's just you really
just got to be at the top of your game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys over there are just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's just I don't know how to
describe it besides like maybe like the
[SPEAKER_00]: boom in California market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it really makes people rise to
the occasion and really hone in their
[SPEAKER_00]: craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you sort of just touched on
it, but do you think pairing with like a
[SPEAKER_02]: big facility is one of the only viable
ways to go forward as a breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think you could do your thing as
a small home scale hobby enthusiast sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of operation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you really need that size and scale
to be making an impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could do it on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think quality just has to be has to be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm still, you know, a caregiver
of sorts, like on my own little personal
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always will have some kind of a grow
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there's always room for that,
but it's definitely becoming smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity is less.
[SPEAKER_00]: These big facilities are definitely
crushing the caregiver market here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that high quality flour is
always going to be in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can, you know, find a way to
cultivate like like my guys over there
[SPEAKER_00]: have and scale up to that level and still
produce that kind of quality, I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's a win win for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you think is the future for
the mom and pop growers in Michigan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that, you know, we're going
to see a similar thing to what happened in
[SPEAKER_02]: California where over time, the smaller
producers may get forced out of the market
[SPEAKER_02]: due to economies of scale and other sort
of factors like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're already seeing that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing, you know, even even
commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that just aren't hitting their
numbers and just doing work properly and
[SPEAKER_00]: just really, you know, honing in their
cultivation departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're getting wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's sad to see, but it's it's the
same thing that kind of happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: California or any of these other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just you really got to step
your game up and really just take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of a full work day and put in
the work, put in the time and take pride
[SPEAKER_00]: in what you're trying to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to answer your question,
I mean, it's that's these these small
[SPEAKER_00]: places are going down and it's not
necessarily because they're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's because, you know, other people
are rising more to the occasion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what would be your glass ball
prediction for 10 years time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think the industry will be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we're all going to be puffing
on vape sticks and no one cares for flour
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have to admit, you know,
I although I live in Australia,
[SPEAKER_02]: my brother-in-law, he lives in America and
he's like 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's young and he's like my pulse on
the general sort of you know, casual
[SPEAKER_02]: smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he he calls me a dinosaur for smoking
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, bro, get a vape stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, where do you think we'll
be in 10 years time if that is sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sentiment we see from some of the younger
generations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I definitely I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand where we're you know,
you're coming from on that sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're seeing flour kind of becoming
less relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, here, like 10 years ago,
people were like flour was dead to them
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody was just dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just hitting oil, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like the oil market's like
probably 10 percent of the sales or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think things are, you know,
kind of not necessarily dying or
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning, but there's like little
phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people kind of like get out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just like, well, I,
you know, hit flour the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, wow, I missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know why I was just smoking
so much oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't really rolling anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that you'll go through these
little tiny phases where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: things will lose relevance and then
they'll gain relevance again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it would for me, it would be
devastating because I am a flour smoker,
[SPEAKER_00]: like through and through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't really appreciate oil as much
as, you know, some of these other guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vape things are super convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I carry a rosin disposable pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my pocket most of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you know, I can't just
spark up a joint anywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sometimes I don't want to
smoke oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want a couple of hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole vape game has just made it
very convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I love vapes, but it's never
going to be flour to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always just like an ease to get
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I can smoke some flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can relate for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you talked of how,
you know, these things sort of ebb and
[SPEAKER_02]: flow, like when you were mentioning,
like, you know, the BHO and concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: in that same vein, you know, on the show,
we often talk about the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_02]: month being very cyclical, you know,
it's like fashion, you know, these things
[SPEAKER_02]: go in circles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the moment, the consensus seems to
be that the dominant flavor in the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for lack of a better term is the
purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you look at people like
compound and cookies and the guys who are
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of dominating the market,
that's the general vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know, what's your flavor
prediction for the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think's due to come back
around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, geez, coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas is making its way back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing would make me more happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely like this huge wave of
lemon sherry gelato and that whole kind of
vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be like, you know, it'll be like
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when cookies hit here,
people were like, you know, what's OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything's cookies, like OG's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, cookies kind of
started to fizzle out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you started getting these
different gelato kind of things that were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people went on these little tiny
phases where, you know, it was like the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon sherry gelatos and the nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they all have their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had some of them and I was
impressed by some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I kind of get tired of them
after a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not something that's, you know,
like a kush to me where I can smoke it day
[SPEAKER_00]: in and day out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a desert island strain for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, I've enjoyed some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see their relevance for a period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys have really good marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't that doesn't hurt at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's like flavor of the week for
sure stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diesels and the Kems and the cushions
are going to make their way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they already are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just they're not as
accessible to some people as some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might take a little bit longer,
but done properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I guess marketed correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the kush wave will be here
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you mentioned cookies and
then how it gave way to gelatos and the
[SPEAKER_02]: more newer waves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to ask you, you know,
a lot of people talk as though you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies and then progressing to gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe the more modern extension
is, you know, like your RS 11's now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like this is a genetic dead
end that sometimes people talk of it as?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, do you agree with that sentiment
and would it ever stop you from breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: with that stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you not quite of the view that,
you know, it's this doom and gloom genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: dead end?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that some of these guys
are going to hit dead ends where it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: so many things combined that it's just not
unique and just has no value to really
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these other guys that are doing
some of this breeding, they're really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of looking to isolate certain things and
be unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that will make way to the next
phase of where things kind of go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be heavy contributors to
helping out where we go with all this
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's definitely people,
you know, and a lot of that stuff's like
[SPEAKER_00]: money grab stuff where it's like,
I'm going to use the hottest flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: cross it to whatever it is that I got
going on and kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it for sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody has to do a little bit
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, some of these guys,
like you said, they, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're bringing back some of this old
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of those genetic lines
are definitely responsible for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, through isolation of certain
traits and other things, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll have different waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different directions that we go in and
people have different needs and wants and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll breed for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll move on to the next phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be as optimistic as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of, you know, I've said this
once or twice on the show, but it sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: makes me want to like, get like someone on
the show who's like, hecticly down the
[SPEAKER_02]: rabbit hole of like the craft beer
industry or something, because I'm sure
[SPEAKER_02]: there are other industries that have gone
through what we're experiencing where
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, Budweiser dominated the
market and the real heady, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the equivalent of the haze of craft beer
or whatever falls off because no one wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we see, you know, a resurgence of
the craft beer scene now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure that in time, these things
will stay around and pop back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder what the life cycle is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, like with the beer industry,
because you brought it up, I'll use that
[SPEAKER_00]: as an analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, if you told somebody in
the 80s that sour beer was going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, you know, they'd be like,
yeah, for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a whole category of sours
now, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I think as long as people are
kind of like being, you know, ingenuitive
[SPEAKER_00]: about how they're doing their breeding,
I think that people are going to stumble
[SPEAKER_00]: upon things that kind of like open up
doorways to different paths that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: really help benefit, you know,
the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, who knows what those are,
you know, it could be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these Northern Lights projects
that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: People working with or, you know,
some of these other old school ones
[SPEAKER_00]: getting brought and mashed together some
of the newer age genetics and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: opening up doorways that we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think certain things are going to
basically be maxed out or are maxed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think weed is going to really
necessarily get much stronger as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: like lab testing goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're pretty much maxed out in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really imagine something breaking
40 plus percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't seem possible, you know,
you need so much of it to actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: plant matter to hold trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're kind of getting close to
a dead end or at a dead end with potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless they figure out some like chemicals
that are in certain genetics that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: not able to test for or not testing for
maybe a certain combination of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: active chemicals, basically making you
feel more stoned as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think flavors are going to be the
turkey in game is going to be where things
[SPEAKER_00]: are going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to ask you, cause you
mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is like the rough
ballpark percentage you would be
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable accepting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for a long time, you know,
I talked to people about, I think in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past I've said anything above 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know if I can really believe
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like one of those you take
a, you take flowers and you get a test of
[SPEAKER_00]: that three different labs and you get
slightly different numbers from everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess until they figure out some
honest gold standard, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's to say what is and what is,
you know, I have the Han Solo that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have here in Michigan that we have
available on the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll test at 37, 38%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when you smoke it,
you know, it's strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, are those numbers
accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested it a few different labs and it
came up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've retested it and it came up the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's really to say that kind of goes
back on the whole, what we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about earlier, like do numbers really
matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and shouldn't it be more on the
end user and the effect that they get?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that THC content is not
irrelevant, but it shouldn't be the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're focused on as a consumer when
you walk into a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, you know, you touched on the
idea of standardization and I think in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to get that, there would probably
likely need to be federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to ask you, what's your
thoughts on the idea of impending federal
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization in the States and how do you
think it might change the landscape of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's going to happen
eventually because the government wants
[SPEAKER_00]: their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as simple as that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the majority of the States,
you know, besides people going in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually voting, but it's tax money,
you know, it's, it's revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's standardizing it across on a federal
level is eventually one day going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen because it would, it would
eliminate, you know, the black market,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely the impact that they've
had through legalization has, has
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed the black market to a certain
point already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see why they would stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to get them more money in
their, their, their hands by making it
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be cool to see how it
unfolds with these companies doing
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-state now and continuing to spread
across where you're going to get companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like the Marlboro of weed,
where it's like, you know, just absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no craft at all to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just packs of joints for dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people will be okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's people going to a store
and buy Bush beer all the time and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people, you know, buy a four pack
that costs as much as a whole case of
[SPEAKER_00]: beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that market's always going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's through full legalization
on a federal level or things stay how they
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably, probably will for another
month, maybe two or three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it'll be a hard push through
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to see some big
changes and it's going to be harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: play ball here for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, what might be your advice for
anyone who's, you know, trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: establish themselves in an industry where
it feels like it's becoming increasingly
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I haven't heard this sentiment
from a few people who are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just sort of starting to get really
passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gist of what they express is that
like, it's never felt more difficult than
[SPEAKER_02]: ever to say, try to be a breeder or to be
a grower who's not just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: providing myself with some flowers,
but trying to actually get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any advice you might be able to give
people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's the same sentiment that
I've said, you know, since 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: 99, 98, when I first started smoking,
like it's all going to be genetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, learning to cultivate that
genetic properly and, and on a craft level
[SPEAKER_00]: is obviously a huge ticket to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, having something unique,
if, if every store you walked into to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: any product, if all the products were the
same, then why are you buying one company
[SPEAKER_00]: over another company?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if, if quality is the same and
the product's the same, then what does it
matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thing that I would say to people to
not discourage them is that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking pop seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find some unique shit that
people don't have and kind of separate
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and, and kind of make your own
way and kind of, you know, kind of do that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole route because it's, it's,
you know, only a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're playing by the same rules,
if you're making up your own genetic pool
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're kind of like, you know,
got unique products, then it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always going to be an audience for
that, you know, just it's part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole adapting to the whole game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just, you got to have your
own unique twist on it and play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's certainly a sentiment I can get
behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to sort of push that a
bit myself, you know, encouraging people
[SPEAKER_02]: to do their own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as opposed to trying to do your own
Cushmint's hybrid, I'm sure JBZ can
[SPEAKER_02]: probably do a better one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than you or I.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that line of thought, you know,
what would be your advice to someone who
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to start their own breeding project
and specifically, how would you advise
[SPEAKER_02]: them in terms of like selecting the
genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say work with stuff that's
totally different to what other people are
[SPEAKER_02]: using?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you say work with what you're
passionate about and then try to drive it
[SPEAKER_02]: in a direction that's unique?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where would you start?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always use the passion route
because if you don't really stand behind
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, you're doing, then the second
that it starts to not make sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: like on a financial level, you're going to
want to back away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's breeding is like a long game.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I mean, you can't like rush the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to use stuff that
people like, but put your twist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's take your passion and kind of make a
fusion of what other people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: around you have passion about when it
comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do it in my line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not crazy about,
you know, gelatos and some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that over the years I've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to take something like that and then
put my twist on it and kind of like put my
[SPEAKER_00]: tag on it and say like, gelato is okay,
but this thing that I did to it makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to run these things,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my suggestion to people is always use
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always, oh, it's always the thing
that's going to be the accelerator in your
[SPEAKER_00]: career.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we get to talking about male
selection, which is always a topic people
[SPEAKER_02]: are keen to hear about, I want to ask,
I've heard increasing sentiments,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just from breeders, but more
importantly from actual seed banks and
[SPEAKER_02]: seed bank owners that they feel that
there's been a bit of a change in the
[SPEAKER_02]: market demand and that the majority of the
market is primarily only interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed that reflection within
your own sales?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's your thoughts on a growing
demand for feminize and less interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: regular seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, feminized seeds have definitely
progressed to be more popular than they
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's a certain market,
a certain percentage of the seed popping
[SPEAKER_00]: market that doesn't have the space to deal
with male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't care for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to have it in their stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I mean, I do understand that
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big part of what makes
feminized seeds relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of eliminates the selection
process and makes it easier to make
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is trial and error involved with
reversal of female genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes some plants don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of trial and error that
goes along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, they both have their own
obstacles, but traditional breeding is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more on the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, none of these factors matter if
you're running and testing your seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what comes of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just kind of wasting space and
you're not burning people's time and their
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really on the breeder's end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I definitely see where
feminized seeds are kind of the majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably more than 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably, you know, maybe 60% of
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are really actively looking
for fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, some people use like autos,
you know, I haven't really gotten to autos
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, but there's a place for
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you read my mind because I was going
to ask you, you know, I've seen a myriad
[SPEAKER_02]: of GMO autos on the markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tried any autos in general
or more specifically any of the GMO ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's your thoughts on autos in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran some autos in the early 2000s when I
had really, really restricted space and
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't really super knowledgeable
genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a buddy that went to Amsterdam,
brought back some, some autos and I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even remember what they were at this point
so long ago, but not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess for outdoor farmers there,
you know, a lot of these guys are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see them dominating the
market over traditional or feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the couple of guys that are doing the
autos are really doing a good job with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they've I've seen the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the, you know, maybe past five
years, some of these guys have really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of dialed it in and actually gotten some
not hemp looking nonsense to come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, props to them on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us, some of the autos were just
terrible for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think a low rider might've
left a bad taste in a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_02]: mouths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess, you know, if we just loop back
to the question before about the feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, I do wonder, you know, for a long
time people had concerns about breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: with feminized seeds, you know,
and I think that empirically this has been
[SPEAKER_02]: proven to not be a big issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it in the sense that
like Canorado compound, a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders out there, you know, they make
FEMS and then they find stuff out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: and they make FEMS and doesn't appear on
the surface that all of the seeds they
[SPEAKER_02]: make are now just hermy riddled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question is, do you feel like over
time we may run into issues if we are just
[SPEAKER_02]: using FEMS to breed endlessly and we don't
necessarily incorporate regular males into
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think so for sure, but I'm not
basing that on any kind of scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, logically in my head,
it just seems very plausible that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get more reoccurring
hermaphrodite traits that are going to pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up when you're re-feminizing,
re-feminizing, re-feminizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know a lot of these guys are
using feminized, you know, phenos and
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing them to make further lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them aren't having issues right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you also got to think like
some of these clone onlys, maybe some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these KEMS, look at the KEMS, you know,
those were bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a herm or some kind of
possible pollen that floated around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you talk to, you know, I believe
Kam even said like they were all every
[SPEAKER_00]: seed that he popped was a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the odds of that being,
you know, a pollen donor, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the dog bud or whatever the mythical
KEM line was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that if you kind of work
that long enough for enough years that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to fall into some kind of
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional breeding shouldn't be like
completely abandoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's definitely always a place
for it, especially with preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just something people got to
be careful about and make sure they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate too much of a hermaphrodite trait
in the lines that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a reasonable point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what my thoughts have been is,
you know, maybe we don't see it now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe we see it down the track.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to help antidote that, I'd love to
know what do you like to select for in a
[SPEAKER_02]: male?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any particular traits you look
for or do you feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess maybe a better way to put it is
for you, is it an art or a science?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it things you're looking for or is it
more of a feel and, you know, certain
[SPEAKER_02]: males you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's talking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a sweet spot in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I won't use a male that I don't feel
something toward, you know, some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like pull, gravitational pull of me
wanting to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll flower out multiple males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what the flower starts to
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how they stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see certain qualities that you
wouldn't know if you didn't flower them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my lines, I never use multiple males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use one, but I'll save like the
best three because if I use a male and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know what, this didn't,
you know, translate to the offspring how I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's try a different male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll remake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just look for, you know, I look for,
you know, a structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see stress test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see drought test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain leafs at certain markers that I
see that I think would be like stressors,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really like a guessing game,
but with a safety net because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: other males you can use, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, you know, DJ Short expressed
the sentiment that, you know, he sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: felt like ultimately it was just about
popping the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that was how you decided if it
was a good male or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that in a sense is where
it leaves you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy fucking was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a few more of your lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely wanted to touch on,
but before I name any specific ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to draw some out of you,
which is the first question being what out
[SPEAKER_02]: of your lines do you feel was the most
unexpectedly successful, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit of a dark horse, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used Obamacush and I hit it with the
dining burger and some of those females
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out were like this mothball kind
of like fruity mothball kind of just crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile is the most like one of
the most overlooked genetic crosses that I
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like people needed to really
like hunt those properly, like do like
[SPEAKER_00]: proper selections on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything that came out of that line
was like just epic, but some of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just like amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was, I was just mind blown by some
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Obamacush is like in the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had the Obamacush?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's two, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the one from CSI and then there's
the other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've had the one from CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, I think originally it came
from maybe some of his stock or it was an
[SPEAKER_00]: accidental cross that somebody got a seed
in some of his flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I think it's like Mendo curve
cross with like Baba, I think is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how'd you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you like it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like real chocolatey awesome vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, use that one and just, you know,
like the offspring was just, was just epic
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, I didn't expect it to be as
good as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wound up when I tested the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, uh, it was really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it brings up this question I've asked
people in the past, which is where do you
[SPEAKER_02]: delineate between something you're happy
to put out and something you're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is like, let's say you made a cross
and 50% of the seeds are like fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everyone unanimously would say,
this is a keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other 50% of the pack herms
consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you feel comfortable putting a pack
like that out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where do you draw the line between
something that's good versus like,
[SPEAKER_02]: or only some of the plants are good and
some of them may be a bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the harm thing is, is a, is an issue
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wouldn't put out a line that was
like a 50% of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now 50% of what comes out of it being
good and 50% not being great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just put that as a disclosure and
I'd be like, well, the stuff that came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it that was good was so fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you guys really need to crack through
these beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's worth the half that aren't good
to get the other half, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but.
[SPEAKER_00]: The harm trade and that thing is just,
it's difficult because some people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of space and you don't want to
burn people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen, I've seen some breeders put
out some stuff and they give people a
[SPEAKER_00]: heads up and they're like, Hey,
look, you know, like I made this genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Herms have popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is it something that you guys want
to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you feel about me releasing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen breeders like reach out and ask
the people and they're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, if it's, if what's good is
good and you know, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, I guess a fine line there
where I guess if you tell people what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is and the issues that you're having with
a line, but for me, I just, I just stay
[SPEAKER_00]: away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that kind of problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, not everybody's,
you know, fluent on social media where
[SPEAKER_00]: they see everything that's posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody just goes on a,
on a seed bank or on a website and they
[SPEAKER_00]: buy something and they don't know the
potential, you know, arm that can do their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just, I would hate to be somebody
that ruins somebody's time like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing should be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: To eliminate as much problem for the
consumer as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's the only honest way to do
any of this though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, on that same sort of line of
question, if you could only recommend one
[SPEAKER_02]: of your packs to someone without knowing
anything about them, which pack would you
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the easy way to think of this
is what's just a general sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what, I don't want to use the
word cookie cutter, but like what's
[SPEAKER_02]: something where you think most everyone
would be pretty stoked with what they got
[SPEAKER_02]: from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would be like, if everything was
available, you know, I only make genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever I get yield for seed wise out
of it, I'll never remake a genetic cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just my way of keeping things unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, if it was all the same,
I had unlimited amounts of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell everyone to run the Han Solo
burger because that's just, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something special for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's, it's got the GMO in it,
which has got its place in my heart and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got the, the Larry OG line that I
worked on for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of like its first
mashup of those two where they,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they met and just the selection on
there and the range of phenos that popped
[SPEAKER_00]: up were so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, if you, if you just,
if you're an OG Kush lover, there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was plenty of that in there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you loved chem, there's plenty of that
in there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's just, it would be my
go-to, I guess, to be like, if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what Skunkhouse's backbone is,
like this is, this is, this is us
[SPEAKER_00]: represented in seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wanted to touch on a few more of
your strains that had been particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: notable for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's going to be a bit of an
extended question, but I feel like I got
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it all out there to help lay the
groundwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to know a little bit about the
Mike Larry and how it came about,
[SPEAKER_02]: but specifically, you know, the follow-up
is obviously this one made a lot of waves
[SPEAKER_02]: in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was picked up by jungle boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ran with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the follow-up question is, how much of
a boost does that give to your company to
[SPEAKER_02]: have someone like jungle boys running with
one of your strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, how did it come about the Mike
Larry and how did it get picked up by
[SPEAKER_02]: jungle boys and what effect did that have?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Mike Larry and with a lot of
genetics that actually put out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really like, like pop culture kind of
like infused into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's where I get a lot of my ideas for
names and just kind of directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like Han Solo Burger and
Mike Larry, and just a lot of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are kind of like, I don't know,
bringing art and bringing pop culture into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is kind of like, that's like my
backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the most easy way to describe
it is like, you know, I'm a cultivator
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, so I sit around a trim table and
be us with food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're buddies while we're, you know,
spending hours and hours and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like go off on crazy, you know,
talking tangents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we listen to music in the background
and there's, you know, sometimes movies
[SPEAKER_00]: playing in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that stuff in the background
is the influence to where I get names and
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Mike Larry is just, it was Larry
OG and there was bad boys playing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movie when we were, when we were
trimming Finos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just him saying,
I'm Mike Larry and then over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again, you know, I'm like, this is just,
this is the Mike Larry, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some goofball stuff like that,
you know, like this, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy, like wildly creative about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of like put in my head
and then it came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, how did the cross come to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it something you were thinking about
on paper for a long time and then finally
[SPEAKER_02]: did, or was it one of those ones where,
you know, it was just in the mix and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it sort of stepped forward as a real front
runner?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, there was a bunch of, you know,
there's a bunch of different gelatos and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had, I had done the cross with a few
different variations, different gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a few that really popped out
that really mixed well with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ivan over at Jungle Boys kind of
recognized that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tossed him a bunch of different seed
stock that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to do a collab and, you know,
that one stood out to those guys when they
[SPEAKER_00]: ran it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he said, why don't we do a,
why don't we do a TK BX?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll take your, your TK Larry,
Triangle Larry, and I'll cross it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the TK and we'll do a mail line with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've really liked this Mike Larry
line and we'd like to use it in a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, cool, let's, let's run with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what you, you know, let's see
what you can come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much how the Jungle Boys
collab went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's killer to hear that, you know,
they, they recognize the, the potential it
[SPEAKER_02]: had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess as a, as a general sort of
marketing sort of angle, what,
[SPEAKER_02]: what effect does that have on a company to
have Jungle Boys pick it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: My gut instinct is that it helps expose
you to a whole new demographic of
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers, but maybe that's not
necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel that that collab sort of
affected your overall popularity and
[SPEAKER_02]: notoriety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ivan is a beast in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that would say otherwise,
it's just lying to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sets trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, you know, the Jungle Boys do their
thing for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That collab definitely took some of their,
their viewer base that didn't recognize or
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know who I was and kind of shined a
little bit of light on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then outside of what it did or what it
didn't do for me, it was just kind of cool
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with another big industry guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really my first collab I ever
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of, you know, I was lucky
on my half that I got to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of something that cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm, I just wanted to quickly clarify,
you know, cause I have seen a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Jungle Boys seed releases and there is
that TK back cross mail in the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the mail that you were referring
to that they built off that Mike Lowry
[SPEAKER_02]: stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the TKBX1 is, I had made TK crossed
with Larry, back cross one, F8.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found a killer mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crossed it back to the Triangle Kush
and then they hunted through stock of that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then did their line based off of their
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it opens the door to a
follow-up question, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you feel about people breeding with
your work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think the majority of people are
usually pretty okay with it, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: people have certain requests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sit on that one specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get a message from one of our
listeners who said that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they popped a single pack of Donnie
burger, found what they think is like a
[SPEAKER_02]: unicorn, just a really special plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said great structure, incredible
growth, good yield, deep, funky smells,
[SPEAKER_02]: test really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you have any issues with people
breeding with your work?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that I, where I stand with
that whole thing is like the only thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: would want to see out of people if they're
going to use any work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just for them to put their own unique
twist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's awesome when I see
people use stuff that I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like contributing to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad and I'm lucky I'm able to do my
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do love to see when people actually
take something that I did and kind of put
[SPEAKER_00]: their twist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that makes it like just that much
better and more refreshing than seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody just take somebody's work and
like make up twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or find a male and then just dust a bunch
of clone onlys with a male they found and
[SPEAKER_00]: then release the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't, I don't have any issues
with either one of them regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it doesn't really bother me,
but on a, on an artistic standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's just way more
flattering when somebody says your work
[SPEAKER_00]: was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to put my own twist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then seeing what they do with it is to
me, that's just the highest compliment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear, you know,
hoping that it inspires some innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another strain I wanted to touch on was
the modified banana line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why, you know, our
listeners are probably sick to death of me
[SPEAKER_02]: saying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banana OG, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's super underrepresented,
especially banana as a flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't see it as often as you
might hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
modified banana line and how you might
[SPEAKER_02]: describe it to people?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never get sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not even a thought in my head when
I was doing a bunch of the burger lines to
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow work a banana into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that cross came up epically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a selection here for the legal
market and in Michigan of the banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is just, it's killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an all around winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a huge, huge banana OG fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, shout out to Oregon kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a hundred percent, a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what sort of plants can people expect
to get if they buy any of those crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I noticed that, you know,
there's still a few seed banks who stock
[SPEAKER_02]: your work, who have got a healthy amount
of stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the criticisms we get of
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we talk about all these awesome
strains and they're all sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought we'd better touch on
something where they can still grab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how might you pitch some of
those hybrids or in general, what traits
[SPEAKER_02]: do you feel the modified banana Mao brings
to things?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a rotten banana peel,
you know, like that's the turkey profile
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would, I would say bus describes
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has that banana peel to it
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lends, it lends in some of the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant yields very solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super picky with feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of like, you know,
juice it up and not have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can kind of take a decent feed,
decent heavy feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like banana OG, you're going to
like that banana line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that banana comes through so
much on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's hard not to appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gorgeous to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I have ran a few banana OG hybrids
over the years and I feel like it was hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to get a banana dominant expression out of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something you ever heard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, you know, the banana in there
is not like really, really heavy,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times, whatever you're working
with genetically and crossing it too,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of like powers over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you taste is kind of like a,
like the cushy kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: standard kind of OG ish kind of fucking
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did a back to banana cross,
which is banana OG crossed with modified
[SPEAKER_00]: banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that yielded out some massive banana
OG plants, great buds, great structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: great terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arguably, if you hunted enough of them,
you'd find something even more banana than
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody ever comes across those and
they're still available, like grab them
[SPEAKER_00]: and just enjoy the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they were, they were so much fun to
run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's excellent to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to ask you a question a moment
ago when we were talking about the Mike
[SPEAKER_02]: Larry, but we did have one of our
listeners ask what sort of traits slash
[SPEAKER_02]: plants can they expect to find in the Mike
Larry hybrids?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were eyeing off a few of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any you'd recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, I'd offered the straight Mike Larry
V2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The V2s I thought were better than the V1s
because I liked the gelato that I used in
[SPEAKER_00]: it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The V1, the original Mike Larry used a
gelato 45, which was solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a solid plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the V2s I used the gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one I thought was a lot more
unique and kind of brought more to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table and the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it wasn't just the Larry OG in that
I used the Paris Larry, which was Paris OG
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed with Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: F8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that male kind of brought
more of the traditional Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can find the, the Mike Larry
V2s, I don't, I don't know if there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: still available or floating around there,
but those were pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them like Larry crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really messed around crazy,
crazy amounts with the V2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: V2 crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that respected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally didn't, you know,
make or run those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could only imagine that there's some
killer stuff in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did notice that you'd use the Paris OG
and a few hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I wanted to ask you, was there
anything specific about the Paris OG that
[SPEAKER_02]: really drew you to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was just, you know, the Paris OG
was like a really, I've like enjoyed it as
[SPEAKER_00]: like an OG Kush lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a really unique kind of OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of structurally grew a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't so lengthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit more stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that kind of trait was cool
from a Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I made the cross and I hunted through
the original Paris Larrys, I just noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that it kind of was bringing up a bunch of
different type of kind of like OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: clone only, you know, traits from like
some of the Louis traits and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of those other ones that I
didn't even work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it kind of was, I don't know,
like a, like an amazing tool, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to use in a hybrid and kind of just like
brought the best of both worlds and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: overpower the gelato and kind of brought
its own, you know, OG and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, just really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just really fun to grow fun
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, as a followup to this,
I had noticed that the, the Mikey Mike was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty similar in terms of the genetic
combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a lot of real all-stars in there,
you know, between the gelato, the Paris OG
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, I noticed, you know,
you bred it to the F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I wanted to ask, was there any
particular reason you decided to filial
[SPEAKER_02]: breed this one forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any sort of goals you were
looking to hit, or was it just a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: line?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Mikey Mike was just Mike Larry F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a, that was a respects cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't involved in the breeding of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be kind of like more like a,
his, him question on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he was breeding it toward
certain traits or I'm not really sure
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what he was looking to get out of
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just more isolated, whatever
phenol that he was, he thought was good,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you guys, tend to do crosses
independently?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the whole collaboration process
work with you too?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for years, I was the only one that was
pretty much producing seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had an outdoor space that was larger
that he was able to utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did a couple of lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did the lemon lime orange apricot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a smaller project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did some double burger crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he did the Mike Larry,
the ones that dropped this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mike Larry's from this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty much a California seed bank
trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any part of those ones at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you guys discuss crosses together
as like, you know, I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should pursue that or how does that
side of it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did when we were still working
together, kind of like brainstorm and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, well, you know, I'm going to,
I'm going to go in this direction because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is, this is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my passion project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he would say, okay,
well I, you know, I want to do this or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, cool, you know,
make the seeds, pop them, see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately at the end of the day,
we both just kind of envision things
[SPEAKER_00]: differently than one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just kind of parted ways and he's
doing his California seed bank thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pursuing the path that I wanted to
do with the skunk house originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome to hear that you guys have
been able to sort of leave it on a good
[SPEAKER_02]: note.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you about a hot topic in
the industry at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that's been prevalent in the EU
scene for a long time, but something which
[SPEAKER_02]: is a bit more freshly discussed in the
Americas, which is white labeling of seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: or more specifically, you know,
making seeds for other companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just sort of letting them decide
what they want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to open the door to this
discussion because I believe you have made
[SPEAKER_02]: some seeds for other breeders in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on white labeling is
just a general sort of topic to begin
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I think it's an acceptable
thing to do these days, as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just open about it and tell people what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it all really falls back on seed
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main concern that I think anybody has
that's buying seed is they want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they getting viable, good tested
genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as long as that's true on a
seed release, then I don't think anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else really much matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's authentic, it's, it's what the
breeder says it is, and they're standing
[SPEAKER_00]: behind their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can appreciate that sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the follow-up question is like,
where do you draw the line?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll give you an example, and maybe
that'll help flesh out some of the details
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's just say that old heavy days
buys all his seeds from Skunk Master Flex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the packs, I list all the proper
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lineages are all correct and all the
information is essentially correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when people ask me about them,
I'm like, oh, I made these ones last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the question is, at what point do
you feel like you're sort of crossing a
[SPEAKER_02]: line with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it okay to say you made these seeds if
that, in your opinion, is integral to the
[SPEAKER_02]: sale of the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel like you'd have to be just
a hundred percent upfront and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I actually didn't make these,
but this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sort of draw the line between
protecting a business's identity versus
[SPEAKER_02]: being upfront about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a tough fucking question,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like there's so many people
in this industry that are just really not
[SPEAKER_00]: even making their own seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just, it's a weird,
that's a great, that's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess if you're being honest
about it, then it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed's dad is incredibly tough to answer
because I feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I, when I offer seed, I want to be
authentic with people and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: open about what's going on and respected
some, some, some seed making for skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he popped up and was like,
yay, made these seeds and people were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did it under skunk house and
they'll probably continue to do under
[SPEAKER_00]: California seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll use lines that he worked on and
he's putting his own twist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, good for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be open about what you're doing with some
of these, like, where do you draw the
[SPEAKER_00]: line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess people have to draw the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess as a breeder, you're not the one
that's drawing the line or the,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the company, the one that's drawing the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just, you're just offering a
service and, and you let the people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, decide if, if they want you know,
seed stock being made from who they claim
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being made from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I guess ask the breeder for
thorough, you know, information on how the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds were made and the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as the consumer can stomach
whatever the information they're being
[SPEAKER_00]: told, then I guess, I guess everyone draws
their own line of some sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think like this idea or this
sort of concept will expand further?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you said, there are some
breeders in the industry, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use the word loosely breeders who
don't make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess you could say, well,
you know, maybe they're like burner,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're the hype man and they
sell the product and that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the question is, do you think
that that trend will continue?
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, we will see people who are
like the middleman or the hype guy and
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding becomes, you know, more of a
backroom sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe, maybe the analogy is like
with rappers, you know, we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the rappers on the front and the
producers in the backroom doing the hard
[SPEAKER_02]: yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do you see it playing out over
the long term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the music industry is like a
perfect reference to using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they'll use some super
attractive girl that maybe necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have a great voice, but then
they'll use like a voice synthesizer and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, use a studio and make your sound
a certain type of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you hear live and
you're like, wow, that doesn't even sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like the same person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, her voice isn't that
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, using that as obviously just an
analogy to, you know, like you said with
[SPEAKER_00]: burner, you have a front man and,
you know, who's really doing the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's part of the whole
marketing, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's how they're
choosing to, you know, make people look at
[SPEAKER_00]: them as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, don't be interested in the
guy making the seeds, be interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy that's talking about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll continue to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably something that's been
happening for a long time, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like Adam Dundas anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you got these crazy, crazy breeders,
you know, that are just like working these
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there's a lot of F1 stuff coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people want stuff that's for
their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't want fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want, you know, IDL lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see, you know, F2s,
F3s, F4s before they want to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you know, dig too far into a
genetic pool and kind of do some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it's people dictate the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they keep buying things that,
you know, justify or don't justify a price
[SPEAKER_00]: tag, they're kind of they're kind of
creating the market and legitimizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what people keep buying and
what people stop buying, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I totally stand by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Behind all of that, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as one that's a bit of a I'll give you
some specifics, you know, I've heard of
[SPEAKER_02]: situations where some people get upset
that someone else has made the seeds on
[SPEAKER_02]: behalf of a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not talking about white labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say you come around my place,
you bring around a bunch of plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, hey, here's the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I selected it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to hit all these females with
it and then, you know, we'll have our
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all happy with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on, you know, the the
person will be like, well, I did the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it's not you didn't this
guy didn't actually make the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the question is, in my mind,
it seems reasonable to believe that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, if you select the mail and drop off
all the plants, you know, you've sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: made the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just someone's just facilitating that
pollination to go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's any difference there
between white labeling or do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that, like, it's more like what I describe
where it's like the person who does all
[SPEAKER_02]: the selection and comes up with the plan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're the one who's made it,
even if they didn't physically facilitate
[SPEAKER_02]: the pollen hitting the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there's there's a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the selection is the whole art of
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as long as you keep the plants
healthy and, you know, facilitate the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollens to the to the female and,
you know, do the basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic grow, the basic flower of it,
it's the rest of the work is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest, the most difficult,
the most challenging part is the selection
[SPEAKER_00]: of the mail and the isolation of whatever
female you're going to use and lining up
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, it's kind of like drawn
out a map of what you think is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other person is just driving the
car from point A to point B, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely some different type of
white labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely kind of white labeling at
the same time, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's like one in the same,
but different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a bit of a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I mean, as a little bit of a change
of pace, I would love to ask you about
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an interesting topic because I
truly feel there's no wrong answer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess if you look at the spectrum of
testing, you know, in the past,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was this expectation that absolutely
everything can very thoroughly tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as time's gone by, I've had many
guests on the show who echo this sentiment
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you were to do things like the way
we did it in the old school days and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing these really vigorous
testings on everything, you're sort of not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be able to keep up with the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, by the time something's actually
ready to go to market because you've done
[SPEAKER_02]: all the testing the way people want,
you know, the market sort of moved on a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look at the other end of the
spectrum and you've got guys like Masonic
[SPEAKER_02]: who I really like Masonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he says, no, I don't test
any of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very upfront about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you this pack is $50 because
it's not tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, it's 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I guess I'm wondering, where do you
stand on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel one side is more correct than
the other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's just a distribution
and it's like, just as Masonic says,
[SPEAKER_02]: just about being honest, it doesn't really
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think there's a right or
wrong as long as you're transparent about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think if, you know, if you,
like you said, Masonic or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: if he's telling people, hey, look,
these are not tested seeds, buy them at
[SPEAKER_00]: your own discretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're 50 bucks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can wrap their head around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm just going to spend 50
bucks and I'm going to see what comes of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, that, that cool,
you know, there's, there's nothing wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what somebody, the direction
that somebody wants to do with their
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some price tags, when you
start to get more expensive, certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things are expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when you start getting into the
multi hundred dollar price tags,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that line should be worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that seed should be somewhat
exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they should be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you should know what you're
getting if you're spending 200 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, yeah, if you're going to
offer some cheap stuff and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it available to anybody, then,
you know, just disclose that you didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: any testing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think if you, I think if you
try to sell seeds that are crazy expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't test, you just kind of drop
them and you don't tell anybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's kind of a dick move.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the topic of testing, you know,
what sort of a protocol, if any,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have for figuring out if you like a
strain, you know, in the past we had Bodhi
[SPEAKER_02]: on and he was like, when I make a new
strain, I just pop 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I try to emulate the average consumer
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I don't find anything nice,
then I think maybe I shouldn't release
[SPEAKER_02]: this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't want somebody to have
that experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a certain number of seeds you
like to go through?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it a bit more like what Bodhi said?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with some of the past lines,
I've made so many crosses and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: space is restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what I'm trying to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, you know, what my goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got 10 different genetics I'm trying
to drop, then I'll do something like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a 10 or a 12 seed or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that, you know,
the average consumer would purchase a pack
[SPEAKER_00]: and pop a pack and see what comes of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're not allowing yourself to
see the full expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can pop a pack, more I'll pop
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like the Bodhi approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you're emulating what the
people getting the seeds are going to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you have four to six good
females that you're kind of looking at and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no issues with those, then I think
you should be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is cool though to see a
bigger pool and kind of get an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of more rare things that will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, you know, what's the most
common, you know, feno that you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: or did you see any of that kind of stood
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some people want a little
bit more information, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think his approach is cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to ask you, I haven't asked
you already, what style of growing do you
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of mix spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do we've been doing a lot of LED type
stuff lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a lot of screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do everything hand watered soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I switched over to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use irrigation systems now because I
have too many plants to tend to and take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of to kind of hand water and do
everything on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing testing, I like to not pop
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just kind of stake them and kind
of see what they do naturally on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of see what kind of natural
structures come out of them and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing more of a grow for flower
yields, I like my canopies to be even and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll top them and kind of get a nice grog
kind of thing going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have a preferred medium,
a preferred nutrient source, anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've been sticking to cocoa lately
because I had so many batches of soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: were just contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of these supply stores out
here will just like kind of like leave all
[SPEAKER_00]: their soil sitting outside and in the
summer, the winter months or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just you'll get gnats or you know,
they'll come with all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been kind of like staying with
like HPCC just kind of running cocoa mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I haven't had any issues
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switched over to a couple of different
nutrient companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think once you're just dealing with
salts, you're dealing with salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Athena has been a product that I've
been utilizing over the past four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: months and yielding great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do terpene profile testing and we do
lab testing and we're actually getting
[SPEAKER_00]: better numbers using Athena than the cocoa
line that we were using before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Aptis for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aptis was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked Aptis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many parts and couldn't use it in
irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of forced my hand to steer
away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was hand watering, Aptis did
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the Athena line is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really clean, great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend it to anybody that's looking
for ease and solid results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always good to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to ask you, what's your advice
for anyone who's in the industry who might
[SPEAKER_02]: be a little bit jaded with the state of
things?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I personally feel like there's
never been a better time to get involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis, but I do talk to a lot of
guys who were probably pretty heavily
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in the scene back in the two 15
days, you know, back the sort of golden
[SPEAKER_02]: years when, you know, pounds were four K
plus sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your advice for people who feel
like it's all gone wrong and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't really see a pathway forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're around back on
Palmsworth, you know, I've been around
[SPEAKER_00]: Palmsworth 6400 hours, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supply and demand, higher supply demand
probably hasn't gone down, if anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, to compare when, you know,
you had to actually go out and look for
[SPEAKER_00]: weed compared to driving down the street
and just buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, prices are going to come down
and fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your passion is in cannabis,
and you believe that you can produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: good product and unique products,
then I don't see why anything should be
[SPEAKER_00]: dictated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, then you just get involved and
just kind of like, you know, master your
[SPEAKER_00]: craft and do the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people always appreciate quality
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter how much demand or how much
supply there is, they're always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: seek the best flower, the unique flower,
something else that people don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't let the current state of the
market dictate whether you are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, let the passion kind of
steer you in the right direction and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out your path and blaze your own
trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a few fan submitted questions
before we get to the final five quickfire
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first one I wanted to ask you is,
can you tell us a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash burger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great yielder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very burgerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO definitely dominated in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to like hashy strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you have to be okay with
the GMO profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it was so dominant in that
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just it was basically like running
a triple burger or a double burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, it was just straight GMO most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's your bag of tea, then yeah,
it's definitely for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what strain would you recommend for
any listeners who want to run some of your
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, but they're thinking,
look, I do produce flower commercially,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not necessarily in a facility,
but like, you know, I make my income from
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So strain does need to lend itself a bit
to that, you know, maybe a little better
[SPEAKER_02]: yielding, some good turfs, maybe easier to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything jumped to mind from your range
that might fit the bill for someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: keen to run your stuff, but it just needs
to be a little more commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the cool thing about most,
almost every skunk house strain is it does
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and it does have bag appeal and it
does have nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of the genetic lines that I've
developed has a phenol in there that is
[SPEAKER_00]: for a commercial grower or any
circumstance that, you know, somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to select, you know, any phenol from
any pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hash yielders, there's,
there's, you know, flower yielders,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's everything because it's,
it's most of it has GMO spliced in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it'll just yield like a
beast, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the burger lines especially,
so stick to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG lines yield very well, but they
don't yield as much as the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO lines, the burger lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would definitely say sticking to some
of the Donnie cross is even the modified
[SPEAKER_00]: banana crosses yield super well and can,
you know, completely be viable in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's really not a bad option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it just depends on what kind of
turf profile you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something available in almost
every of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another fan submitted question we got
is do we ever have any chance of seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe any S1s of your keepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do a whole S1 line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I've had a couple of projects that
have just kind of taken front seat to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of gotten bumped back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a bunch of small S1 work just to
see what is and what isn't viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten great, you know,
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've yielded amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is going to be a bunch of S1
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also going to be clone drops,
breeder cut clone drops that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be available here in Michigan for people
that maybe don't even want to pop seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just want keeper genetics off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got a bunch of stuff in the
works and just trying to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things possible for anybody in
any circumstance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the plans for Skunk House or
Skunk Master Flex more generally in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you got any projects you're keen to
start or any long-term visions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now we're doing the Josh D
collab one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really, really psyched on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as an OG lover, it's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the end LBL for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to work with somebody like Josh,
that's such an OG vet, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like just catapult the OG and
bring it to the masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's a dream collab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really looking forward to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few other people that I'm in the
works of negotiating collab work with that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really, really excited about if they
go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always going to keep running and working
on the Larry line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, uh, a fan favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the burger lines are not going
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always room to expand on those and
bring in different genetics to kind of out
[SPEAKER_00]: cross and work and see what comes of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots, lots in the works for Skunk House
and over the next couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: not planning on going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to keep things still with the same
idea concept I've always had, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: like only make the cross once.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that actually get it,
like let them have something that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique and let them do their selections
and kind of let them have that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, exclusivity is very
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a question we love to ask all our
guests, what are the rarest seeds in your
[SPEAKER_02]: vault or the seeds that you're most
excited to pop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some original Chem D GSE where
the GMO came from seeds laps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a small little pile of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are everybody's like, pop those,
pop those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, I got some Northern lights
crosses that I got from a guy that made
[SPEAKER_00]: some, uh, out of New York, um,
Northern lights sat in cross with like
[SPEAKER_00]: this IDL Northern light that he did,
um, talking about what we did earlier with
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole bringing back old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those have been kind of like burning a
hole in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have some, I have some, some AK
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're even viable
anymore, but original packaging AKC is
[SPEAKER_00]: from like 97 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, been just dying to pop those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a bunch of older stuff, man,
that's just been sitting there that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I, I like, I'm afraid to pop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if they don't pop, I'm just going to
be so devastated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just like kept putting them off,
which is like the dumbest thing I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's, uh, the seed vault is just
so expensive, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I got to find time and dedicate
space to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one of those things you
don't want to mess up because they're so
[SPEAKER_00]: old and you're not going to get them
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can relate to that concern with the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So onto our final five questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the first one, it's a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we've been doing recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had to restart your seed company
with just one packet of your seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: presumably to find a male, but you know,
you might also pick a fem pack and find a
[SPEAKER_02]: female and want to go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What pack would you pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is seeds that I've released or in
my collection, uh, seeds that you've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never released them, but yeah,
I would probably just use the straight
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry, uh, back cross F eight or F nine or
F 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start a line from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to pick them up and put 20,
30 of them into water and just find gold
[SPEAKER_00]: and work a whole line with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an easy peasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's no, no difficulty at all in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next one is what's the single most
memorable or impactful experience you've
[SPEAKER_02]: had with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, getting arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just realizing how fast, like for
something that you love so much,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it can just mess your whole life up
and how stupid it is that it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, just, it makes me realize all the
people that were before us and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: paved the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it really levels me out and
grounds me that, um, people did so much
[SPEAKER_00]: for legalization and allowed us to be in
the state that we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's just that, that one act of
just going through years of, of courts and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff, just for, just for
something stupid, like having flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's outrageous, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's, uh, that's probably the
most impactful thing with cannabis that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that I've had to go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone can deny that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, next question would be what's a
strain that everyone around you was hyping
[SPEAKER_02]: up your real life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, is this over like the whole
duration of just working with cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: just recently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's been some really hyped up
stuff that I've really gotten ahold of and
[SPEAKER_00]: really didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a tough question, my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like from like things from like,
just, you know, like not to pick on purple
[SPEAKER_00]: punch, cause I actually enjoyed purple
punch, but like, um, people were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how like amazing it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you smoke and you're like,
I, I get it for flavor, but it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't have some kind of wrecking
devastating high, especially coming off
[SPEAKER_00]: the era of like OG cushions and chems
where like, you know, these things hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're expecting this fruity tropical bomb
of just pure insane high, not really quite
[SPEAKER_00]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of the gelatos I've been kind of
disappointed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really think they were that
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it's hard to, it's hard to
pinpoint one genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like kind of dumbfounded right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of one that I've just been
completely like just in awe of how people
[SPEAKER_00]: even enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of these frigging designer ones
that have came out recently and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there's a lot of like boring Turk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say any of the boring Turk ones that
just don't really do it for you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: high or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, uh, you know, you expect more
from the people these days with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: options they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next one we have is we're going to drop
you off on a desert Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably you can grow three strains for
the rest of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What three are you going to take with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, OG Kush, number one, not any specific
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say just an OG Kush, the original,
the Larry, any of them, any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: category would work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a chem, either the chem four or the
Chem D, um, and possibly a Bubba Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, probably the original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those are just like, if I could just,
as long as I have jars of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: like one of the three of those will always
do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're desert Island strain for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a couple of close competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like maybe the Urkel, sometimes the
Urkel can, the Urkel is weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, sometimes it can almost be too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the real Urkel is like devastatingly
crushingly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, it's strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I want to go to bed
all the time, maybe that one, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I could eliminate it down to the
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just being OG Kush, that would be
my, my desert Island strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single desert Island strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to turn the tables now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you're going to drop someone else off
on the desert Island, someone you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly fond of.
[SPEAKER_02]: What three strains are you going to leave
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Temple Hayes from, from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just fucking wig out and have a
terrible time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that would, that would be
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people I'm sure love that shit and
it's just now for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not a green crack fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give them some green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green crack never did it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd give them the, the skunk,
the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a terrible thing to do to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the weed you can smoke is just sweet
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a terrible, what a terrible,
terrible life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that's probably, dude,
that'd probably be sweet skunk or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our final question for the interview
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a time machine for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back anywhere at any time,
any period, presumably to collect some
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds or maybe even a cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go to like, I'm going to go
to like Amsterdam or like Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be like the mid to later
nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to get like some old sensing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of their earlier skunk work,
some of it, I feel like some of,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that stuff has just been used,
whether it's been admitted or not in so
[SPEAKER_00]: many crosses and so much of the foundation
of what we know is cannabis now that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like ridiculous, you know, it was just
such stabilized work and just maybe if it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't the most devastating high,
it was just.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such an important part for cannabis
genetically that it would probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, it's a good pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some killers around there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it for this one today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my guys, man.
