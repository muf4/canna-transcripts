[SPEAKER_00]: Big fan favourite and a personal favourite
of my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for making the part two happen,
my man, Matt Wright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, someone sent in some cookie
berry crunch from, I think, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon, his and her grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were one of the last people keeping
MediCroppers special cut of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they thought they lost it and they
sent it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I also have some something called
cult cake from a local grower,
[SPEAKER_05]: King Cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a part cheesecake for mad
scientist genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to say euphoria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Euphoria cake or something for mad
scientist genetics, a combination of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jesus, MediCropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a minute since I've heard that
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I was first getting into
weed, I was watching his videos on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever interact with him much?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sent him the cookie berry crunch and
stuff to run.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a real nice dude, but we never got
real close and then he disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He dropped off and then he like put up a
post being like, I'm in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think that just fell through as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I don't, I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: He popped up maybe, I want to say five
months ago, but, and I talked to him for
[SPEAKER_05]: like a second just to ask him if he still
had that gut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, no, I don't still have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was interesting,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think I've mentioned this to you
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the, the names of your strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can like, I hear the name and I'm like,
that's a Matt Wright strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to admit, I stole that line from
him cause he was the one who was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it in his videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, heard the cookie berry crunch
and he's like, that's a Matt Wright
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My naming conventions are a little off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people don't like them at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Cokehead slut was not super
popular, but you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I literally had a question about
that, which I guess we're going to jump to
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, yeah, like when,
when I was cruising your site like an hour
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, I saw the Cokehead slut and I just
started laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck, that's a good name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like strain names should be
embodying of kind of like what the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: has to offer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think like a good strain name is
a good strain name?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I look at it like art man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, everything that, that, that I do with
breeding, I look at like art, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, I've always been a musician and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, art's been a big part of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like, you know, like the
ultimate outcome of breeding is,
[SPEAKER_05]: is what your desired goal is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's almost like having a canvas that
you're painting and you have that ultimate
[SPEAKER_05]: desired goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're not happy with it,
you'll throw it away, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and all of that comes around and then all
the way to naming that painting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, it's just whatever mood I'm in,
whatever I'm thinking about, whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: possessed me to make that creation,
you know, that's, that all goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had a strain that you felt like
was bang on a particular flavor level,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just say it's like, it's bang on
cherries or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like you really want to call
it like have cherries in the name or that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really influence you so much?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, some of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, uh, I see a lot of names out
there like cookies that doesn't taste like
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking cookies, but it's, it's been
established as, you know, this is cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the look, this is the shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I've been trying to migrate away
from that, but like with my banana stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously the banana OG was a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that, that's usually an in the
names because the terpene profile and the
[SPEAKER_05]: way I took the line was totally banana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so when it comes to flavors,
sometimes if there's like an amplified
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor, usually that'll be in the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot has happened since we last spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me a bit of a rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you currently up to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, right now I'm going through the whole
blue, the blue lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's always been a big passion of
mine was the blue stuff, not just because
[SPEAKER_05]: of the terpene profile, which is my
favorite terpene profile, the true
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry jam, blueberry muffins type
terpenes, but, um, the high, the high from
[SPEAKER_05]: very, very select special blueberry,
uh, like the highland Thai Thai pies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's, it's clear, clear headed,
very euphoric in many ways, but not
[SPEAKER_05]: slammingly potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's really hard to describe to
someone like a lot of modern, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of modern smokers, uh, people from
the generation right below mine,
[SPEAKER_05]: they probably wouldn't see as much value
in it as I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause a lot of them are used to the,
the narcotic Afghani Thai pies,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, uh, yeah, this is special to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I lost my riot Barry OG mom in a
tissue culture debacle, which we can talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about later if you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moony moon.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got to say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know, I have to be careful cause I
don't want to get, uh, in trouble legally
[SPEAKER_05]: cause he's a little rat, but, um,
yeah, he killed, he literally killed
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that I owned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, his big takeaway was that he didn't
physically touch it, but, um, and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: true, but the, the, the thing was he,
he had a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I was moving and he's like,
Hey, let me, let me take your mom's and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll hold them for you while you move and
I'll tissue culture them while I'm doing
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he sent someone up to pick them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He supposedly had a facility in LA with
this dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude came, picked him up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I, I stayed in contact with the dude
and Moony during all of this and no one
mentioned him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mention anything about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fucking killing everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, it took me moving and being like,
yo, I'm coming to get my shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm sending someone to come get
my shit now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I had to get real mean about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, when I did, I found out
everything was just liquid in bags,
[SPEAKER_05]: no more moms.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just took cuts off shit, throw it in
bags in a box.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been sitting there for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's so brutal to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, uh, lost my, uh, what we,
how would you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my, my strain that I'm being
working on for the longest time,
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberry Mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so devastated when I found out
that it was, it was just gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like no one still has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so bummed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I saw the silver lining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of forces you to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you feel about the situation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there is a few, few good things to
come from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, um, I was going to start working
heavily with Moon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I learned he was a little piece of shit
from the beginning, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, secondly, yeah, it's forced me to look
in all different directions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I get to rework all those
blueberry lines, the old blue sativa lines
[SPEAKER_05]: that I love.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of cool to be able to do it
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thirdly, I got to see who my,
my real friends were.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of people that reached out
and were like, Hey, I got this of yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sending it like right now,
you know, without me even asking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was pretty heartwarming,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I also got to see who is true to
their word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there were several people that I made
trades with, uh, like $10,000 worth of my
[SPEAKER_05]: spray, reverse reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it was right before I did this
with Moon because I always want to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: plan B just in case something fucks up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I did a big trade with a few
people, few different people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, look, if I ever lose anything,
I want to be able to grab certain cuts
[SPEAKER_05]: back right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, just, this is just a card in
pocket and they're like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they have all these fem lines out and
the second I needed them, they're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, I don't got anything for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The course, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, again, now I know that
they're, they're, you know, who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it's almost like that legend OG
situation where you're almost like just
[SPEAKER_00]: testing people, seeing who's going to be
the real homies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you brought up the blueberry thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was only about like two days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Swami, not the, uh, the one who
walks around in the white garb,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, the, the one who fucks with those
cool genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were saying something about how,
you know, it seems like basically DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: short's work has hit a dead end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came to that conclusion by the
fact that JD's work with it has just been,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in their opinion, quite
lackluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you feel about the idea that,
you know, the work has been somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: bottlenecked?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a few, there's a few levels
to that question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to start off with the source.
[SPEAKER_05]: Swami.
[SPEAKER_05]: Swami's he doesn't know jack shit about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither does gas can to Stan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've put them both under the fucking the
fire, you know, on my live feed and
[SPEAKER_05]: otherwise they wouldn't come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, what they were doing was
attempting to make the one from,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, uh, uh, the other asshole.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember his name, but,
um, who is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it mountain organics or coot?
[SPEAKER_05]: No coots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were trying to make that look like
an old DJ short line by saying it was high
[SPEAKER_05]: Lentai and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually popped a bunch of it to
see, and there's no relation at all in any
[SPEAKER_05]: of that to the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is that factor to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't, I don't think they have a
right nor the history that they claim
[SPEAKER_05]: being a part of brotherhood of eternal
love.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like a lot of liars pull from
that brotherhood of eternal love,
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking card pack, golden coast,
you know, idiots like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, like, but I will say that
DJ's lines have transformed a lot over the
[SPEAKER_05]: years and, and the blueberry Indica stuff,
the Afghani based stuff, it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly blueberry anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I have a bunch of that
running with all the old blueberries right
[SPEAKER_05]: now and it's, it's, uh, yeah, I don't know
if it's due to inbreeding, not being able
[SPEAKER_05]: to take it back in that direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not a want to, to visit that
direction anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but then I see him release stuff like
new berry and I haven't run that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't comment on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he's trying to go back in
that direction, but, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a big fan of any of the modern
blueberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I like that, uh, JD's going towards
the F 13 and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the best, uh, DJ lines ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's been real cool, easy to talk to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, DJ, not so much DJ is not as easy to
talk to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when I, the last time I've met him
several times, but the last time I saw
[SPEAKER_05]: him, he, he told me that my company was
not owned by me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought that was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting observation.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, you don't, you don't own
Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a guy named Riot Sully Shepter
that owns Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, no, I'm pretty sure he
owns Oregon seed bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a cool dude, but yeah, no,
he doesn't own my company.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, no, no, I think he owns Riot
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice seeing you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice seeing you again, DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember at Emerald Cup, I was able to
smoke on his, one of his newest trains
[SPEAKER_00]: first light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was very much drawing from the
more kind of flow flavors and terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I would agree with you on that
blueberry comment about how it's not so
[SPEAKER_00]: present anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish, I wish it were, um, when I had my
Riot Berry Cup before Moon had so
[SPEAKER_05]: graciously murdered it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I, I offered it to DJ because it was
so, it was, it was so much in the
[SPEAKER_05]: direction of the blueberry jam,
very purple, looked a lot like Oregon
[SPEAKER_05]: purple tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I figured, man, this is like,
it's, it's a lot, it's bred in the
[SPEAKER_05]: direction of the baseline, like the Oregon
purple tie, but with all the blueberry
[SPEAKER_05]: trains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, blueberry turps and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I offered it to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just was not fucking interested in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he didn't believe me or if
he just didn't want to go that direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, that's his prerogative,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I tried offering that to him and I
kind of wish he would have taken it now
[SPEAKER_05]: just so I could have gotten it back from
someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the newer blueberry kind of
players to hit the scene is Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company who have their blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had a chance to try that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, the blueberry muffin was a cut
and it was my right very OG cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been that for, I don't know,
over a decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, now these guys supposedly are mountain
people who don't really give two shits
[SPEAKER_05]: about naming conventions or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's fine and dandy, but,
um, you're going to offend people doing
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like putting out a Jack Herrer that has
nothing to do with Jack Herrer,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, genetics, um, a headband has nothing
to do with headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Ethos did that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, I don't know if that's a new thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just steal a name and slap it on bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I've been told they're nice
people with all that said, I've been told
[SPEAKER_05]: they're nice people by, by good friends of
mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to go too heavy on it,
but I know I have not tried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one of those things where it's
like kind of, I want to try it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but at the same time, I don't want to
support someone who just jacked me and
[SPEAKER_05]: used all the, the energy I put behind
something to make their line sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to have a quick chat with the
owner Nat at the Emerald Cup and he
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely is a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I was also able to have a chat
with their head breeder and I was less
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced when I was asking him some
serious questions about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, cause they claim it's an
F4 and then on the packaging, it says it's
[SPEAKER_00]: an F8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, so which one is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't really give me a convincing
answer and I was like, ah, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool man.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's an S1 F4 F8 PX.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those fucking assholes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's, uh, let's keep on the naming
conventions for a minute, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question thrown to me the other
day and I couldn't answer it, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said they made, they used some fem
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made the S1s, popped the seeds and
then they found some males in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, that could be like
rogue pollen by the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, let's just assume that it is
from the pollen that they thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, if I make F2s with these
seeds, what would they be named?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, would that be like S1 F2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know how to name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you call that?
F2R?
[SPEAKER_05]: F2 reversal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's, that's essentially what it
would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, like the, the male,
um, the males popping up from fem seeds is
[SPEAKER_05]: it, it's a, uh, it's a, it's a topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of people were very staunch in
their beliefs on, um, there was a paper
[SPEAKER_05]: the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I had it handy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that, that my friend bittersweet
pulled up and it was from, I want to say
[SPEAKER_05]: the seventies talking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gave a full rundown of what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and basically it is that nature finds
a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the answer to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, now when they're tested, I know Caleb
from CSI Humboldt has sent in some stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, males that have been found or plants
that have been expressing male found in
[SPEAKER_05]: S1s or, or, uh, reverse hybrids sending
those in and they're coming up testing as
[SPEAKER_05]: female, but they're only expressing male.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're not expressing any female
traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's a weird topic, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not always going to be that way,
but, um, it tends to be the most common,
[SPEAKER_05]: the most common argument is that it's
pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think 99% of the time it will be
pollen contamination, but there,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's many times where it's popped up
and there's no way it could be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're left with, well,
was it, is it a female that's just
[SPEAKER_05]: expressing male?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it an actual male with male
chromosomes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and, and it's different,
seem to be different in every case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I really wanted to ask you,
do you feel like the chemicals used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal spray could be a contributing
factor?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I tend to think that,
but, um, you know, there's people that
[SPEAKER_05]: disagree with me that have just as much
time reversing and maybe even more
[SPEAKER_05]: experience reversing than I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I take that into account as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I truly believe that, that in
stressing a plant, you're, you're changing
[SPEAKER_05]: its epigenetic, changing it at the
epigenetic level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, you know, I was watching an
interesting Ted talk the other day talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about epigenetics and it had to do with
rats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, and mothers nursing their,
their rats, their ratlings, whatever you
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking call little rats, ratones,
um, ratitos, uh, but yeah, like if they
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't, if they didn't nurse them,
it changed them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It changed these little rats at the
epigenetic level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and they're already born, they already
have their set set of genetics,
[SPEAKER_05]: but at the epigenetic level, just by not
nursing, it changed them for life and it
[SPEAKER_05]: changed the future children 10 generations
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I think that if you do it
with, uh, uh, stress and, and strictly
[SPEAKER_05]: stress, cause there's a lot more hormones
that are involved in stress than there are
[SPEAKER_05]: in simple reversals where you're just
blocking, uh, blocking ethylene and,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, and promoting to Berlin, you know,
that those are the two main things that
[SPEAKER_05]: you need to reverse.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, in stress, there's a lot more
hormones involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it changes the plants at
the epigenetic level to be more prone to,
[SPEAKER_05]: to herm stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, if you go that method, which I believe
Soma calls a rhodolization, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a bullshit term in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but you know, torture your plants and,
and make seeds that that is a method that
[SPEAKER_05]: people use or run them too long and have
them herm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully that makes seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a method people use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's not my choice method.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and this is just a theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be totally fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be totally fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might, one might be just as perfect as
the other and not change anything at an
[SPEAKER_05]: epigenetic level, but until we have the
ability to test for that, who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the effects of vertical
transmission of stress, are
[SPEAKER_00]: well-documented in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense that it would apply to
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I thought it was fascinating that 10
generations down that they're seeing that
[SPEAKER_05]: epigenetically everything is fully
affected, like up to 10 generations down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even people that smoke cigarettes,
males that smoke cigarettes during
[SPEAKER_05]: conception, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or females that smoke cigarettes after
conception and, and in the, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: and when it's in her, what the fuck?
Uterus.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I am talking botany and I don't know
shit about biology, but, um, apparently,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, even smoking cigarettes and stuff
like that affects generations,
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 generations down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if I believe the quote was,
if someone starts smoking at the age of
[SPEAKER_05]: nine to 11, it will affect their
children's children, 10 generations down
[SPEAKER_05]: negatively.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, I mean, that's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So decisions we make as children can
affect future generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got this friend who's a
doctor and he was saying to me that he
[SPEAKER_00]: finds it very peculiar how there's this
similarity within, uh, unstable cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and like really low socioeconomic
humans in terms of everyone kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: jokingly acknowledges that like,
you know, women from low socioeconomic
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds tend to have kids at a younger
age than if you're like kind of more or
[SPEAKER_00]: well off, you'd have them a little bit
older when maybe a bit more financially
[SPEAKER_00]: set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, it's so peculiar how it's
like similar to plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like an unstable plant will hermaphrodite
and want to produce these offspring at
[SPEAKER_00]: like a much earlier age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got these epigenetic effects that
go on for generations, much the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: like what happens in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck, I never thought of it
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a brilliant analogy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's along the same theory that I
have, like, you know, if it's stress,
[SPEAKER_05]: stress induced as opposed to just
chemically induced without all the other
[SPEAKER_05]: stress markers, that it changes shit at
the epigenetic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, while we're on the topic of femme
spray, we've seen a few new femme sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: come out since we last spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like different companies producing them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think it's good, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in, in business, you need,
you need competition to grow and push
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone to make the best product
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's a great thing,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I, the one thing I don't like is,
is people putting out bullshit that's just
[SPEAKER_05]: going to waste people's money and time
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen a lot of that, a fucking
load of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you how many emails I get
from like Tyrese has missed customers
[SPEAKER_05]: messaging me and saying, Hey, this shit
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to fuck a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've got to rush through this
and then I have to rush ship them spray so
[SPEAKER_05]: they can finish their shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, yeah, but as far as any
competition, um, hive, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: he's been doing it longer than me.
[SPEAKER_05]: His spray is very effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, CSI Humboldt was able to reverse
triangle with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he, he used my spray, his spray and
hives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hives work great for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did burn the plant up, but in,
in reversals, you're not really worried
[SPEAKER_05]: about keeping it pretty.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're worried about pollen dumping and,
and his in that case was very effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there, there is also people need to
keep in mind, like there are certain
[SPEAKER_05]: sprays that are more effective for
different phenols of different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I mean, it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It drives us all to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give you a quick shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, my fem seeds were made from
your spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I a hundred percent back it, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One for the homies, but uh, most notably
with these new fem sprays coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen our buddy Swerve put up a post
a while back saying like, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of offering a new spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part which caught my eye was that
he said like, you know, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the implication was that
others on the market are maybe not done
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Swerve is a little bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, he's going to take shots to
anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to try to come in anywhere in
the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you look at how the quality of his
seeds and how he did it, producing fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: auto flowering herms in a line that was
supposed to be neither, um, it's probably
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be the same with this spray.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's never been really effective,
uh, at, at doing reversals again,
[SPEAKER_05]: tons of pollen contamination and tons of
males and a lot of his lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and he's kind of doing it just to be
an asshole, but whatever more power to
[SPEAKER_05]: him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring on the competition motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen and Swerve shout out,
bro, you can come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm such a little bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's got a story to tell as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I, and even though I don't like
Swerve, um, I will say a lot of the OGs in
[SPEAKER_05]: the market, um, the OG cushions were based
on his seed line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I, a lot of people renamed a lot of
his lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I'll give credit where it's due to
that dude on that, but it's just,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the first Emerald cup,
I finally got to see him in person and we
[SPEAKER_05]: were not cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, it was right after, I had my
interaction with a dipshit day from golden
[SPEAKER_05]: coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I walked up behind him,
throw him in a quick choke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, then I let go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being an asshole now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of being a bully on this little kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, then he walked up and he was
being, he was being nice after and he's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, yo, you know, it's, you know,
we're both OGs, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you know what,
if you're changing, if you're changing
[SPEAKER_05]: your attitude in life and shit,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, uh, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my number.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I shit you not the day I get home,
he's already talking shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like, wow, did you just do
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to get your ass beat.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was looking forward to him
changing, uh, his tune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, something you mentioned,
which I think is undeniable is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's certainly a lot of work out there
that does use his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the more notable ones is purple
punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they used his Larry OG,
a male from that to make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about that for a minute and I
was like, well, there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who don't really write purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that like, how does that,
is it a good marketing point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a bad marketing point?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on purple punch?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I like smoking it,
especially because the turps are fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had some really, really good purple
punch.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's almost Barry that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to get smashed every time I
smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't mind it, but I get why people
are like, okay, it's really resonance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives the appearance that it's going to
be really potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's not, it's disappointing in
that, in that sense, but it's made it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, it's made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh, it's made its mark on our market
and that's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you feel in general about some
of the purple strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause to me, at least it's like,
it seems like it's the first purple strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really made a mark on the hype
market in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of think like, I mean,
props for doing that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the first people doing hardcore purple
work or Naboo, um, Sonny Chiba off of
[SPEAKER_05]: Naboo's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like to credit myself with a lot,
but I was one of the first people really
[SPEAKER_05]: putting purples out there because they
were hard to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were real hard to find purples back
in the day and people see it today
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't really understand how,
how rare it was and how much of breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: it took to bring that to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, CSI did a lot of
beautiful work with Urkel, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: with purple Indica, um, you had CVF doing
some purple Indica work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so yeah, you know, I'm a fan of
purples, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that aesthetic beauty.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my garden at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you generally agree with the kind
of idea that purples generally speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: are not as potent as kind of their greener
counterparts?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'd say it would be a case by
case basis because purple Urkel,
[SPEAKER_05]: the original cut is one of the most
smashing potent fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It puts me into a tizzy as it were.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it fucked me up so bad in a bad
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't really smoke it, but I love
breeding with it because of how it breeds
[SPEAKER_05]: and because I like, I like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I always have to hybridize it before I
can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, in that case, it's one of the
more potent ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so it's, it's really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, while we're on the topic of
Urkel, as time goes by, I'm getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more convinced that Urkel is a part of
the cookie's genetic makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given your work with the F1 derb,
as well as a lot of other things in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your stance on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your, what's your kind of,
you know, thoughts on the cookie genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was the first person to put out
cookie and seed form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I guess almost nine, eight or nine
years ago now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just talking about that today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize it's been that long since
it's been out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, back then I noted, okay, I've seen
this before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen this in Urkel and OG hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can pull this out, this exact phenol
out with just Urkel and OG, including the
[SPEAKER_05]: OGKB phenotype, which is a common
occurring phenotype that you see in Urkel
[SPEAKER_05]: and OG hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, uh, cookies probably was done
with GDP, um, which isn't another Urkel
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrid and GDP and that Florida OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I know that not so dog, my buddy has
that Florida OG and it's had it for a
[SPEAKER_05]: while.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a real OG cut that did exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And things like cherry pie though,
cherry pie is the Mendo derb expression,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I think is just Mendo derb and the
OG without the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but you can see very, very,
very much that, uh, the Mendo derb,
[SPEAKER_05]: AKA F1 derb, AKA purple pain, AKA of
million other names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, that's, that's where you see the
expression in cherry pie the most,
[SPEAKER_05]: but in cookies, you really don't see any
of that expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Francis, not so dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I like how he's been like kind of
resurrecting slash really working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you got much experience with that
one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, our, our little circle has it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, shout out to the can Illuminati.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all, that's all I can say about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, uh, we all have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all playing with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we're learning a lot about it,
that it does have a dud trait in it that
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't always express.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like you can take a branch off of it
and, uh, sometimes it's a great branch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's a dud branch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you get a dud branch, you're kind
of fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, unfortunately I have a dud branch,
so I'm waiting for the, uh, clean branch
[SPEAKER_05]: to come.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I've smoked a lot of his Trinity
up at, uh, during Emerald cup this last
[SPEAKER_05]: year, we had the big party and it w and we
got to smoke a bunch of it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually really bummed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to get my own car next time
I'm over so I can drive to these very kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of Illuminati parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a wild party, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that showed up, it was pretty
legendary.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was legendary.
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of like at one point,
um, you know, there was Josh D Bodhi,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, uh, Caleb, uh, not so dog,
everyone in a room, all of us in a room,
[SPEAKER_05]: just talking genetics, dude, just nerding
the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Miami mango was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Marty from triangle Kush was there,
you know, it's just like looking around my
[SPEAKER_05]: buddy resin lung.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the one who actually threw it and was
the host of the party.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, it was a legendary moment
and not many people got to be there for it
[SPEAKER_05]: or see it, but it was, uh, everybody was
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very memorable for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you mentioned one of the favorite
people on the show, the B man himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's things going between you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that Bodhi is looking to maybe
do some collabs going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you might want to kind
of get in the works with him?
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and him have done the purple unicorn
collabs for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, uh, for a while I was only one with
that cut and he gifted it to me and that
[SPEAKER_05]: was, that was special.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sweet of him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, me and him are still as, as close as
ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: If not more close, he came down and we
hung out, went out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just a trip to be around.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a, he's a very unique, human being
and, and one of, one of the people I
[SPEAKER_05]: respect most on earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as far as like, there's a lot of
people you meet them and they're so nice
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're like, that shit's fake.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit is fake.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's that nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with him, it's, it's, it's legitimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is that fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's that good of a human being.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, again, after this moon situation,
he was one of the people that stepped up
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know, like a lot of breeders look
at each other's competition and me and him
[SPEAKER_05]: never have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he stepped up and said, okay,
I'm coming down, I'm coming down and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: going to bring you a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_05]: He, he just, he came down, came to my
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hung out and he dropped off fucking
like 20 different strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, yeah, I, that's the second time
he's helped save my company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I owe that man the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly a one of a kind person, as you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you touched on it earlier, but I want
to get more a bit deeply into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the concept of people outsourcing
their breeding is becoming a more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: common kind of, uh, occurrence within the,
the kind of community.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like it's a bad or a good
thing or where do you sit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I can't, I can't say it's terrible
because I've been one of those people that
[SPEAKER_05]: people call the outsource their breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think, I think people are starting
to learn their strengths in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are really good at marketing
and really good at packaging and
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation, but not so good at breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, I think that's, uh,
it's hard when you have an ego.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all have egos to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as, as artists and breeders,
we all have egos.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, um, it's, we have to put our egos
down to say, okay, someone else is better
[SPEAKER_05]: than me at this particular thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to have them do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now with that said, I think there should
be transparency in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There should always be transparency in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghost breeding kind of sucks, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and being able to just buy street cred
and breeding to me is, is pretty lame.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but outsourcing breeding, as long as
it's transparent, I think, I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be something we see more often,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that was a kind of a neat
little segue into what I love to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole candy rain debacle from cookie
fam, you know, that was one such example
[SPEAKER_00]: of this outsourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more specifically, how do you feel
about their response to the issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like they adequately
responded?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the situation or they kind of dropped
the ball?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, they themselves,
when they first showed up, said,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I quote, yeah, they're breeding shits
for fucking nerds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they, you know, I mean, anybody who
invested in that, that they got what they
[SPEAKER_05]: deserved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was plenty of warning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone, when they even talked about it,
a lot of us came out and said,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if you're going to spend good
money on, on seeds that are bred,
[SPEAKER_05]: why would you go to people who are not
breeders?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you go to people who don't
understand genetics?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, they got exactly what they paid
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I know that I think two or three
people might've been made good on the
[SPEAKER_05]: candy rain where they gave them a,
another cross from, uh, JBZ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm confused why JBZ would want to work
with them, but that's his prerogative.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe it was a good financial
situation, good financial move.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't, I can't hate on him for that,
but at the same time, like I just trash to
[SPEAKER_05]: me, they're trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, does that frustrate you in a
way, the price point they set given the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that, you know, everyone's
probably familiar that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not looking to cater to the
cheapest pack in the store and that's fine
[SPEAKER_00]: because the quality is there to back up
the price tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you've got this situation of an
even in like much higher price,
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower quality, such as the candy
rain, do you feel like that makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: harder for you to stand your own ground
when you're justifying why you do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: pricing you do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, really customers set the
price.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only worth what people are willing to
pay for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if people were willing to pay that for
it, then it's worth exactly that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those, those non-germinatable seeds were
worth exactly $500 a pack or whatever it
[SPEAKER_05]: was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, you know, whether that the
quality is there with it, that's up to
[SPEAKER_05]: them to determine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they like trash and maybe they like,
they like just the fact, they,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe they spent that money for the
packaging, you know, or to make them feel
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, it's, it's a weird situation
with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a lot of people who I
think like, like CSI Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_05]: I see his prices $100 a pack or 200 for
the Chem 91 S1s or it was a hundred and
[SPEAKER_05]: then 200 for the Triangle Kush S1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I know how much goes into reversals
and a lot of people don't understand what
[SPEAKER_05]: really goes into reversals.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main thing being what determines the
price on reversals for me is how many
[SPEAKER_05]: times did I fail before I fucking have a
room that I produced viable seeds from
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you'll have three runs of
nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then, okay, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just lost, you know, X amount of money
per each room that you wasted on a
[SPEAKER_05]: reversal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not a matter of skills.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just how reversals work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I know he had tried Chem 91 several
times and Triangle Kush several times and
[SPEAKER_05]: people were bitching that he charged 200 a
pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have slapped every single one of
them because he should have charged 600 a
[SPEAKER_05]: pack in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they're worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're that rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that hard to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that many failures involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, considering no one's ever
successfully been able to reverse the TK
[SPEAKER_00]: by him, it totally validates your point,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got six seeds from my first Triangle
Kush reversal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, we'll come back to cookies in a
minute, but while we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: TK, you know, the TK Origins crew has come
out of the shadows since we last spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to a few people such as Josh D
who I, I'm a big fan of Josh D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's a lovely guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, he said to me, he,
he really thinks the story is legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he, he backs it, you know,
how do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm friends with Marty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Marty a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he's TK Origins guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are things that have changed over
the years in that story.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main part being the Hindu Kush edition
and that it was intentional.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, other than that, I don't, I don't see
a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any holes in the story that he
was a part of that original crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe that probably to be true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's also the super not dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and he can, he backs up some of the
story, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so yeah, I mean, I, I don't see a lot
of holes in that story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe the intention and the,
you know, might be different and the
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledge of what's in it might be
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it sounds a lot more positive and,
and sure than it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: X amount of years ago when he came online
and talked about it, but that's the only
[SPEAKER_05]: difference I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think he was a part of that
original crew and, and I don't know that
[SPEAKER_05]: triangle would be around if he hadn't been
a part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you feel about this,
uh, Emerald Triangle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle strain that was the supposed
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really struggling to find any
information about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you got any thoughts around that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, no, uh, I, it's, it's kind of like
dog, but it's one of those things that's
[SPEAKER_05]: up in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, yeah, it probably was just a
strain from the Emerald Triangle,
[SPEAKER_05]: but what it actually was Hindu Kush,
probably I think he's even right in
[SPEAKER_05]: guessing that I, I would assume that's
probably a good direction to, to go with
[SPEAKER_05]: it would be a Hindu Kush, uh, a stretchy
more golf ball, nuggy Hindu Kush,
[SPEAKER_05]: which those do exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the Hayes brothers, old Cali Kush was
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The vintage is the eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it called?
[SPEAKER_05]: Vintage eighties Hayes brothers,
California Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the full name that they gave it,
but, uh, it was similar to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there, there was cush is around
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and that strain might've had a name
originally.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not have, but if it came from the
Emerald Triangle, you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's probably what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do you think we got to the
point where we have all the OGs from
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that, you know, the kind of
standard lemon OG type of thing was locked
[SPEAKER_00]: inside those initial TK and Josh D OGs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there was more added to
the pool?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's been more added to the
pool over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, with OGs, a lot of people say,
Oh, it's just an S1 of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know if it's S1s or if it's,
uh, another plant that hermed in a room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there's a lot of that going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people recognize that it was
amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why you started seeing people
keep seeds from these bags of this weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and, uh, as it moved across the
country and through different groups,
[SPEAKER_05]: each person, each group kept a little,
little bit of a different version.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in California, resin lungs crew had
their OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have that copy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was what is supposed to be the
original Josh D OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually a lot more different,
a lot different from, uh, the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the cuts out there called Josh D that I've
seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more stocky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more, it stays about five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas like, uh, triangle will fucking
grow straight up like a vine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I, I have an eight footer in the
room right now, just growing up,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, all lanky.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is lanky, but not as lanky as the
pure Kush, not as lanky as the Loomis
[SPEAKER_05]: headband and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, and then Louie was another,
uh, early OG crew, you know, the Louie
[SPEAKER_05]: Kazarin, I think his name was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you had the Jew cut with Habibi
and those dudes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all the early OGs, people
selecting that bag seed essentially,
[SPEAKER_05]: and finding it, running their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how all of these started
popping up, but whether they were pure or
[SPEAKER_05]: not, you know, we'll never really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting one, you brought up the
Loomis headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to a few people behind
the scenes and I won't reveal any names,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a few people have said to me that,
um, they're, they're a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say ticked, ticked off,
but like, you know, they've got their kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of grievances around the fact it's called
Loomis headband because apparently there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a lot of people who had it before
Loomis did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, part of me feels like,
well, I mean, if he just stepped up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plate and said, this is my headband,
it's called Loomis headband, then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of, okay, he got in first.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if someone named a strain after
themselves, if it was given to them by
[SPEAKER_00]: someone, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's lots of other people who've
got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I, you know, Loomis really didn't name
it after himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was on, he was on, uh, KHC farmer a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, a lot of people just referred to
it cause he was showing off this cut he
[SPEAKER_05]: had called headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name was Loompa on the thing and
people started referring to it as Loomis
[SPEAKER_05]: headband and he just went with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, not the best choice really,
but it's also not the same headband that
[SPEAKER_05]: was around before it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's been fairly established
that it's an OG Kush cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's not the original headband,
but it was an early cut that he called
[SPEAKER_05]: headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of, uh, origin stories on
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That have popped up from him specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I, I, he says it came from New York
out of someone's pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone smuggled that out of a room.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a few other stories that it
was just from someone's fucking room in a,
[SPEAKER_05]: in somewhere up in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it's, you know, there's a few
origin stories on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's one of the best OG Kush cuts
out there, I think right up there with
[SPEAKER_05]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, that, is a, that's, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that for sure, but it is an OG
Kush cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not a traditional headband in the
sense of a Northern light super skunk type
[SPEAKER_05]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, um, whenever you smell it,
you can smell that OG nose on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the heaviest, like soapy noses
you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually, I swear it's one of my
favorites and I never thought I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: actually say that, but like most of the
time when I'm in the States, someone will
[SPEAKER_00]: like have some, and I'd be like,
give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you found a way to smuggle it out
back to Australia yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I wish man, full disclosure,
please Australian, please don't come after
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, basically, um, I, I, I had sent a TK
cut back and it had made it and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the person that it landed at,
they didn't really know how to look after
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and it died after it had landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me photos when it landed and I
was like, Oh my God, it's alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and then like a few days later
they sent me another photo while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: still in the States and it was dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing, the best advice I will give
someone, if a cut is, uh, magically magic
[SPEAKER_05]: through the air to someone immediately get
it and either stick it in a cube in a dome
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's coming out of a hundred
percent humidity, whether you realize it
[SPEAKER_05]: or not, it's, you have to re harden it off
or stick it in a cup of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all you have to do is stick it in a
motherfucking cup of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it sit there for two days,
harden off, then, then start rooting it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, that's, that's the best
advice I can give anyone in that
[SPEAKER_05]: situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that shit sucks when you get
something super rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so hard to get over anywhere,
you know, and, and, and just to watch it
[SPEAKER_05]: die.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had it happen so many times over the
years and that's been the major fix for
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, uh, if any cuts, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Transstantiate themselves over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, uh, we'll see if that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently on your Instagram, I mean,
you're talking about the, the true
[SPEAKER_00]: headband lineage being like that NL super
skunk hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you made that post about one of your
friends who was running the Giselle S1s
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had got like that recessive super
skunk phenom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me think to myself, where is the real
super skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people talk about it,
but does it actually still exist?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, for all intents and purposes,
as far as we know, it is dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't mean that someone doesn't
have it tucked away, but it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: accessible to anyone that we know of and
no one we know, um, in our little circles
[SPEAKER_05]: holds it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think our circles are pretty,
pretty complete right now with people that
[SPEAKER_05]: had it back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we, it's the, the, and it was
actually, I thought it was a Giselle S1,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it turned out it was my skunk spray
cam, which is Giselle across the sour dub.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so even in that hybrid, it expressed
itself purely as the mass super.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it came out skunk spray smelling and,
um, it's, it's the legit real deal phenom
[SPEAKER_05]: of super skunk as, as it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I was worried that it would just be
the structure and look, but not have the
[SPEAKER_05]: smell, you know, the high, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, yeah, it's caused caused quite a
bit of hubbub.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and a lot of the original dudes that
ran the super skunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: want it, they want it back, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool for the person that bought the
seeds and popped them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's, you know, it's his way to make
the mark, make his mark on the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And rightly so he, he popped those seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: He kept it alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did all that and he should be able to
make profits off that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, the super skunk,
it's such a fabled strain and yet there's
[SPEAKER_00]: still so much uncertainty around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my biggest question is, what are the
genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've heard from skunk VA that
he thinks it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe like an original skunk F2 type of
thing, but then also, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got like the, the actual genetics,
which is like an Afghan cross skunk type
[SPEAKER_00]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sit on this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's absolutely, in a hundred percent,
in my opinion, based on running all the
[SPEAKER_05]: old super skunks, it is just a super skunk
Afghani Afghan T, which I don't believe,
[SPEAKER_05]: like Neville said, I do not believe that
it was from April.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was an Afghani one cross to
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has some skunk traits, a skunk one
traits, but it does not have skunk one
[SPEAKER_05]: Terps because I think the biggest
confusion is that skunk one is nothing
[SPEAKER_05]: like what we know in America as skunk
smelling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the American skunk, being a little
animal, what it sprays smells nothing like
[SPEAKER_05]: skunk one, skunk ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the furthest expression or closest
expression to skunk would be cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have all the fruits and
everything involved in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, um, my, my friend, Duke diamond,
your friend, he saw that a lot working
[SPEAKER_05]: with a lot of the skunk ones, you know,
he was working with skunk one and a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people expected a lot of skunk,
but he already knew what he was working
[SPEAKER_05]: with wasn't going to be skunk spray
smelling, but it was the skunk old skunk
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of assumptions were made
on that by the people buying the seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: because they weren't educated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but with that said that Afghani one
have all the breeding that I've done with
[SPEAKER_05]: Afghani one, the LAF old LAF he cut,
um, it, that is a baseline like no other.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to that heirloom Afghani
line that I have that that's caused a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of, uh, commotion with all of its skunk
traits and burnt rubber and, and piss in
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you bring up a really interesting
point there with that LA AFI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the LA con got a really good rap
on its first release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always told that that was
because they had the real cut that first
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that cut now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you reckon?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's a cut going around that looks
like Bubba, um, that is not the original.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have pictures of the original and
it's identical to the Sensi seeds Afghani
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I, uh, there's a catalog from 1999.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you look in, in that catalog,
uh, from Sensi seeds, you can see a
[SPEAKER_05]: picture of the Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is literally identical to that
picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that clone that's been long gone for
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last person I gave it to was walking
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I traded it to him for the Hayes
brothers, Cali Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, he has since passed away.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was one of me and Sonny Chiba's good
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to our, our deceased buddy,
uh, walking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bummer to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was an interesting dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when I, when I, when I was first like
hearing about sub cool and all that,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, on, on breed Bay and I was trying to
figure out what that dude was all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walking dude was the guy who saved Jack's
cleaner for sub cool when he was in prison
[SPEAKER_05]: and gave it back to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've kind of slapped him in the
face.
[SPEAKER_05]: He pulled me aside and was like,
yo bro, you don't even want to go down
[SPEAKER_05]: this road with this fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a lamer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out again to him for fucking
making sure I didn't go down that route,
[SPEAKER_05]: that route.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he introduced me to Sonny back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I learned a lot and all the,
all the stuff that I was really liking
[SPEAKER_05]: that I was seeing come from TGA,
I learned was from Sonny, all that black
[SPEAKER_05]: Russian work, all that beautiful purple
stuff, which is what, what intrigued me
[SPEAKER_05]: about TGA early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're going to get to TGA in just
a minute, but let's, uh, let's wrap up
[SPEAKER_00]: this one first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jumping back to the road killer,
you know, those kind of skunk spray
[SPEAKER_00]: smells, it's, it's a focal point of many
people's phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have your views on this mythic strain
change since we last spoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, I know that a lot of people
have the view that your skunk spray
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani is one of the closest things we've
got to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we'll eventually nail it
down?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see no reason we can't, you know,
I mean, I think, uh, I nailed it down in
[SPEAKER_05]: the diesel sour dub.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's skunk spray, total skunk spray
coming out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I did it with the heirloom Afghani
line and I, and I truly believe that
[SPEAKER_05]: heirloom Afghani line is either an Afghani
one or, uh, Afghani one's super skunk
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrid or just super skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when I was given to me by BiteMe,
he didn't tell me anything other than it's
[SPEAKER_05]: an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked him, well, which Afghani?
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, well, there was a lot of Afghani
one going around at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, uh, late eighties, early nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's when he was popped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he kept those seeds for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only a few popped for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the male, I wish I would have kept
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and the female was killed again by
Mooney Moon Dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're doing a big hunt through the
S ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, me and my, my partner Skunk Tech are
doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and, and I gave some to friends too,
for them to use, because I don't believe
[SPEAKER_05]: that, that I own that really, you know,
uh, I found it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have anything to do with me
other than I made S ones of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that it should be shared with
the community because a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've given it out to like my buddy
Pipsweed, El Hefe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's a lot of people who've gotten
the Afghani for me, um, for free just to
[SPEAKER_05]: bring it back into modern lines and work
in all these different directions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, uh, my buddy Surfweed also did
that, crossed it to my banana tie,
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed it to a bunch of stuff,
old family purple from Caleb.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, yeah, it's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I think people can find it,
dude, just by running, running even
[SPEAKER_05]: Giselle S ones or old chem S ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you're not finding it necessarily in
the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting more of the burnt rubber
chemi stuff, but you can find it in old
[SPEAKER_05]: super skunk lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can trace an old super skunk line
or old Afghani one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, are you of the opinion that
the roadkill per se, at least in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: people talk about it, was not necessarily
one specific cutting, but just more maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: like a general terpene profile,
or do you think it very much was one very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I think it was just people were
getting Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first time they were
experiencing Afghani, which started,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, talking to Seattle Northern Lights,
Greg, he was saying that that Northern
[SPEAKER_05]: Lights Afghani, which was called the Steve
Murphy Afghani that was used in Northern
[SPEAKER_05]: Lights came in the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's always been my contention.
[SPEAKER_05]: The earliest you'll ever see an Afghani is
from 1978.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roughly, maybe the earliest of one person
might have had it would be 76,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you don't see anything earlier than
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so during that era, Afghani started to
disperse and people were used to Colombian
[SPEAKER_05]: gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were used to Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once that Afghani started spinning around
and people in America that were used to
[SPEAKER_05]: smelling skunks, they started calling it
skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm not sure that roadkill skunk was
ever a term used back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more of a term used in,
uh, referring to what had been around back
[SPEAKER_05]: then and had been lost and referring to
many different phenos of an Afghani type
[SPEAKER_05]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just mentioned Skunk Tech is
someone who you're currently working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be willing to share any little
secrets in terms of what we might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to expect from you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, Skunk's one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have all the shirts that we've been
releasing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been going back and, uh,
buying, uh, buying up all of the old,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, I guess you, uh, thermal transfer
shirts from the seventies and eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I've been going back,
buying them up and bringing them back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's, there's some beautiful old
Colombian gold art, all Acapulco gold art,
[SPEAKER_05]: Lebanese red art, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've been working together on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a beautiful, like $45,000 t-shirt
printing machine that does the best
[SPEAKER_05]: t-shirt prints I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, better than even hand screen
printing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so we've been putting those out
slowly, but surely, and people are
[SPEAKER_05]: catching onto that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, we're also doing pheno
hunts, big pheno hunts through a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: different things like, like my heirloom
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we're going to help reproduce high and
lonesome's Appalachia F2s together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, or actually it would be F3s that we're
going to be working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, we have a lot of projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I might be moving up to Livermore by
him so we can continue to actually have
[SPEAKER_05]: him be part of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, that's the ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never really had a partner in Riot
Seeds that, that is that established.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a lot of people work with me on a
lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of people in Riot Seeds,
but as a direct partner in Riot Seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: he would be the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, uh, you raised a really good point
about how, you know, you guys are pheno
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting through stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be working with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've noticed and it is,
you know, I mean, I'll take it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: grain of salt because the Australian
scene, it's so in its infancy in every
[SPEAKER_00]: way, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've noticed that there's certain
people and it's probably the same
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't seem to find, like they
can't pheno hunt on a very rudimentary
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they pop seeds and they can't really
discern the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a bit of a foreign concept,
but I legitimately find it like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: popping seeds and they've never got
anything to offer back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that like, I don't think it's
the case that there's no keepers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: packs because you pop a pack from a
reputable breeder, you're pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to find something worthy of
hanging around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is how do people pop seeds
and not find keepers?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, okay, in order to find a true
keeper, you one have to run the seed,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you should probably run a clone of it
as well to see how it continues to express
[SPEAKER_05]: in clone form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's always going to be different
than the seedling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondly, you have to have your
environment at least dialed in enough to
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to see that phenotype express at
its highest value.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's where a lot of it
occurs, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's again in Australia, it's in its
infancy, indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is, is a lot different, you know,
I mean, that's probably a newer idea in
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia because so many people grow in
the bush out there, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people grow outdoors out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So indoor growing is a lot different than
outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to get these, these things to express
at their best value, you have to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow in your environment at its best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's why they're not finding
these keepers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're thinking, oh man,
this shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, it's because it wasn't
super happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of this stuff, a lot of the best
stuff's coming from the U S and it's being
[SPEAKER_05]: bred in the U S it's acclimated to the U
S.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you bring it to a foreign
environment, you have to acclimate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to acclimate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's another big part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it may harm right away when it,
when it hits the Australian climate and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's to be expected with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So acclimation is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people don't understand that
part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a very valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a while back we had a breed of Steve on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good episode in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He discussed this idea of how,
when he was looking to find keeper females
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed with, he would grow them outside
like two or three times and just be
[SPEAKER_00]: culling the females away until he was left
with like the best ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would take them indoors and
then do the same thing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the end of it all, he'd have
like this female that performed well
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, performed well indoors,
ticks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, a lot of people make the
comment that like, yeah, he's some of his
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, you'd run them outside and people
wouldn't be able to tell whether it was
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor or outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that seems to make a lot of
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that there might be a push to
kind of do that type of more extensive
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting and breeding going forward
for a lot of breeders?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a smart idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Breeder Steve's obviously a legend in the
community and shout out to Kootenai IC
[SPEAKER_05]: Mag, his original breeding partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking dude is so cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, one of my favorite strains
is the blue satellite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue satellite number one, I think that's
a very special, special breeding project
[SPEAKER_05]: that they did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Steve had, he's, he's,
and Kootenai for that, for that matter,
[SPEAKER_05]: are well ahead of their times in doing all
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the smart idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, I'm not as, I'm not as geared towards
outdoor growing, so I probably won't do
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My, all my lines are tested and run
indoors by me and I don't have outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know that I'll be doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe in the future I'll get bigger spaces
and whatnot and do it, but until then,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there is that outdoor seed demand
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to change topics for a minute,
just, uh, I'm, I'm always interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: hype strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always interested in what's ahead of
the curve, not because I get super caught
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the hype strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're not going to see me cruising
around in a Skittles t-shirt, but at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time, like I, I find it
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, uh, like markets and
the way they behave, it's, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically here's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMOs had its run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we moved on to Max next.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, the wave has been cheese
that I've been seeing that people are
[SPEAKER_05]: asking most about in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a, um, it's, it's got an okay
following, you know, like it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, it's small, but it's building.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I do get a lot of questions from a
lot of people and the cheese has been the
[SPEAKER_05]: one that's like, no, please don't bring
that shit back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: UK guys love it, but for a while,
everything was fucking cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything like, and, and I've already
seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did never thought I'd be around for
the resurgence of cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it would be at least 20 years,
but that shit's coming back and in full
[SPEAKER_05]: form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, definitely that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think there's going to be a
resurgence with stuff like the NL five
[SPEAKER_05]: Hayes, you know, I mean, I, like I was
talking about earlier with you,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, before the show and all five Hayes
seems to be peaking people's interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the most, uh, grown strain in the
nineties was NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, our most recent
guest AK Beanbrains actually, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second most recent Carmen was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he spoke about that TK NL five
Hayes and a lot of people's ears perked up
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard much about that one at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, uh, there's been, there's been
some interesting thoughts on that TK NL
[SPEAKER_05]: five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, uh, I am a big fan of AK Beanbrains.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just sent me, you know, the rest of the
catalog, some of his blueberry work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm running his, uh, blueberry cut,
which is very, very easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds me a lot of a blue dream in the
sense of the smells that are coming out of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Minus the Jirpinoline, not as much of the
menthol, but it's like a sour blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has some auto flowering traits in it,
which I I've been able to kind of push
[SPEAKER_05]: back, but I'm not sure how it's going to
breed in the future with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a, he's a very, very cool fucking
dude though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's certainly a very genuine guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to say, before I forget,
you were being very humble about your live
[SPEAKER_00]: streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're phenomenal and people
should get in on them whenever they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with that being said, I wanted to
bring it up before I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Mac a second ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Caps Columbian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the lowdown.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there, before I talk about his
Columbian, um, one of the things that Moon
[SPEAKER_05]: had had killed was his, uh, Columbian
crossed a Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, it was clearly labeled on
the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a bunch of them, sent them over.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I got it back, in the bag of liquid,
it was labeled Caps Colonial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of me and my friends all refer to
it as Caps Colonial from now on,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was such a joke that they
couldn't even keep the name straight on
[SPEAKER_05]: what shit was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the Columbian, you know, I like cap
and again, very nice guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I get along with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like a lot of points he makes about our
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the Mac one cut is very, very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not great for taking pollen,
but for smoke, people love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's very resinous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the reason it can't take pollen is
because it's so resinous and it puts so
[SPEAKER_05]: much of its, um, energy into building
resin that, and, and yield that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: focus at all on pistol at production.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really weird thing, but,
um, yeah, it doesn't take pollen at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found that myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as far as the Columbian in it,
he's, he specifically said they were,
[SPEAKER_05]: the Columbian was from seeds that he got
while he was in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he also said it was a nine week
strain, which most people like myself that
[SPEAKER_05]: have grown a lot and a lot, a lot of,
uh, heirloom Columbian lines, they're
[SPEAKER_05]: usually, you know, 21 plus weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, sometimes they're as low as 14.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a worked American line version of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've seen it down as low as 11 with
the, uh, farmer's choice Columbian,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was a project across the boards in
the, um, early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, with that said, I don't think it's
Columbian in it in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a super lemon haze to be
honest with you, but he says that's not
[SPEAKER_05]: the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, he has more experience with
it, obviously, obviously than I,
[SPEAKER_05]: so you've always got to take that into
account.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it may not be that the actual cut
has super lemon haze in it, but the seed
[SPEAKER_05]: line, everybody is pulling super lemon
haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fino is out of the, the max seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you're not seeing a lot of keepers
come out of the max seeds that were
[SPEAKER_05]: released and there were a lot sold.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's my next exact question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like it's the case that
because the Mac one cutting is so good
[SPEAKER_00]: that people compare their keeper from the
packs of seeds and go, it's just not as
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't see keepers because of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that it was just like a
fluke, the Mac one cutting and the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stock itself is not as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a representation of the Mac one
cutting per se.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that seeds are probably a
hybridized form of that, of the line that
[SPEAKER_05]: that cutting came from and whatever you
hybridized with it, super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it, you know, it could be why it's
coming out so shit because super lemon
[SPEAKER_05]: haze is, it's not necessarily shit,
but it's, it's not what people are
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily looking for when they go buy
Mac seeds per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that same topic, how do you feel
about, uh, late last year, we saw those
[SPEAKER_00]: $100 eighths of Mac from Big Al and more
importantly, how do you feel about CAP's
[SPEAKER_00]: response to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like a breeder has the right
to try to impose some sort of a structure
[SPEAKER_00]: or business structure around their
strains?
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you let it cut out, dude,
if you try doing that shit, you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to catch backlash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, people have, again, something's only
worth what people are willing to pay for
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If people are willing to pay for it,
that's what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that worked for that dude,
Big Al, then that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, CAP's new to that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I understand he wants to protect
his breeding rights and protect a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that he so hardly worked on, um,
that, you know, it's, it's his first
[SPEAKER_05]: reaction to say, you can't do,
you can't, or can't do this with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't, or can't do that with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's cool if people, you know,
respect that and want to respect his
[SPEAKER_05]: wishes, but there are always going to be
the outliers that don't respect his wishes
[SPEAKER_05]: at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And trying to hold them to a standard in a
black market is, is not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the black market, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted there is a legal market to
speak of, but I don't know much about that
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't take kindly to those folks around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's interesting you raised
the point, like the idea of middlemen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I had a chat to Al and he
seemed like a really reasonable guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he mentioned how, you know,
like he's, he's been grown for years and
[SPEAKER_00]: he doesn't really grow so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a middleman now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it raised this idea to me because it's
like, I mean, burn is kind of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, he's not really a grower,
but, um, you know, I just wonder how the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene's going to evolve where we've now
got, you know, like these exclusive hype
[SPEAKER_00]: men.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, with, uh, with the
generation that I'm from, we didn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Breeders either hype their own strains or
the strains hype themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was one or the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually the people that were hyping
their own shit, if it turned out to be
[SPEAKER_05]: bullshit, you were tossed from the
community or you were made to look like a
[SPEAKER_05]: jackass and no one talked to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Swerve, for example, total jackass and,
uh, constantly posting on Instagram that
[SPEAKER_05]: he gets no respect, but that's why he gets
no respect because he acted like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was, he was trying to be his own hype
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was, he was not necessarily moral with
how we treated people and dealt with
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and that was a, uh, a really good
example of, of how that was dealt with in
[SPEAKER_05]: the old days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now with the modern age, younger people,
associate weed with rappers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rappers are always rapping about weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the perfect middleman,
hype man for this generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and in trying to educate them is
really hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw that with Seth Rogan, not too long
ago, there was a lot of pushback with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he came out with houseplant and,
uh, and started calling like chem 91
[SPEAKER_05]: houseplant sativa, which was just on so
many levels, insulting to so many people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, not, not only was it spelled weird,
it was not, it's supposed to be a sativa
[SPEAKER_05]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, all kinds of shit with that,
but he has a massive pull from the
[SPEAKER_05]: entertainment community and people look up
to him as a, a comedian who smokes a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of weed and as a famous person,
he must know good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's where it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, again, but he's not a grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a glorified hype man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, it's going to be interesting to
see how that direction goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it changes, if people choose to educate
themselves or if they just buy into the
[SPEAKER_05]: hype and that's where it goes and,
and, and it's ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just earlier, I think
today, maybe yesterday that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Shabinsky made a post about how there was
like a ride up in, I think it was an LA
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine and it, and it used as like,
it, it referenced the amount of times he
[SPEAKER_00]: had been name dropped in rap songs as
like, as like a metric for how popular he
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the one hand, you're kind of like,
okay, it's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are becoming more accepted and
mainstream, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cause like such a weird feeling
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, like, how is that a metric
for anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really not, but he's not,
he's not, uh, someone that's in any kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of circle of, of real growers and real
breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so maybe that's his personal metric
for success.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he's always about the followers,
how many followers you get and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'll see, you know,
people who are breeders that are private.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a reason for that because we
want our followers to equate to real real
[SPEAKER_05]: world sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: We care about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's just a different world,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like where, where social media is,
is a base level for a lot of people's way
[SPEAKER_05]: of looking at who's successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that you can buy followers
is, is just a, another, another tricky
[SPEAKER_05]: tool in all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Shabinsky, he is obviously the Sherb
is in a lot of people's strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he's a very nice guy himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to say anything terrible
about the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of the few people from that,
that cookie fam, uh, place, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: that group, um, that, that, that is
tolerable, but there are some,
[SPEAKER_05]: some cringe worthy stuff that is said by
him too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I definitely would love to say
as well, please come on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: Shabinsky, you know, um, but, uh,
but at the same time, I wonder where he's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder where cookie fam is going to go
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was like, you know, Sherbert
cross to cookies makes gelato and now
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato cross to some other cookies makes
mochi or however you want to say it,
[SPEAKER_00]: biscotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, where, where do we go from
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just perpetually cookies into
cookies into cookies, or will there ever
[SPEAKER_00]: be like some creative out crossing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I don't think we're going to see
anything creative come from any of those
[SPEAKER_05]: guys or that crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, all we're seeing is muddled cookies to
cookies to cookies to cookies done 90
[SPEAKER_05]: different ways and slapped with a bunch of
names of shit you could buy at Starbucks
[SPEAKER_05]: or somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's not very creative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's a lot of incestuous breeding
that's going to lead to a lot of inbred
[SPEAKER_05]: depression and shitty plants eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people's rooms are stuffed with this
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not growing anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's what the modern market wants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And eventually they'll find that's all
that they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all they have access to and there's
nothing left for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to be a sad day for him
because that's, that's, that's how we gets
[SPEAKER_05]: ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think these guys have any of
these original seeds left that could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially bring to life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something new?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, for me, I always see a pie
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Powers up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lay off the caps lock, homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd say to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's always posting like some new
strains about to drop and nothing ever
[SPEAKER_00]: drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, what's the deal with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just trying to keep himself relevant.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't have anything to offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, he was the one that said breeding
is for fucking nerds and he ain't no nerd.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the guy who made the quote,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that he's talking about
dropping strains and shit, you can't have
[SPEAKER_05]: it both ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't call yourself a breeder and then
say breeders are fucking nerds,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, implying that you're so street
that you can't breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I, yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I see is bad from all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, you know, like I said,
I, it was eight, nine years ago when I was
[SPEAKER_05]: working with cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see new companies coming out and using
cookies still it's time to, it's time to
[SPEAKER_05]: expand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to move on, you know,
like that's the way I feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the market doesn't feel that way
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and that's why it hasn't moved on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people are still new to cookies
every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's new smokers reading high times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies is in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their first experience with
something that frosty, that fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty, that dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, I don't know how long it's
going to stay around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see a change from it,
but, but I think there are unique things
[SPEAKER_05]: you can do with cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's unique ways to take cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chocolate Thai cookies that I did,
I was really stoked about that was on who,
[SPEAKER_05]: who was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Be real smoked some on his show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he, he, he expected it to be like a,
a, a hit him like an Afghani type line
[SPEAKER_05]: where he was waiting for it just to hit
him right away, you know, and over time
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got to see him turn into a giggly,
a giggly soul, you know, through it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it was cool to watch,
but there's, there's, there are
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting ways to take cookies lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of us do that, but I think the
whole cookies into cookies hybrid into
[SPEAKER_05]: another cookies, the gelatos, the sherbs,
the, I, it's just incestuous breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: leading to inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one's maybe a bit of an extended
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my apologies, but one thing I noticed
most recently when I was in the States was
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's just this undeniable consumer
appetite for cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became most clear to me when I was
at like this kind of farmer's swap meat
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was a jar of that, a head
Loompa's headband grown by Mr. Bob
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemphill grown phenomenally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was smoking that the whole trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my homie was telling me, yeah,
like people are only going to pay like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a thousand a pound for this
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next to it, he has a jar of
wedding cake, had no turps to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like, you know,
I mean, it was grown to look nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it didn't have, you know, like what
you would expect of really high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked the part, but it didn't fit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, people will also pay
a thousand for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anyone with a nose would be able to
discern that the headband is way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just looks at me and he's like,
yeah, but people have smelled that nose
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's fucking all this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, how can we, as a community,
get the general public to acknowledge that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah, wedding cake's well and good,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa's headband is a fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just through education.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, I, I've been a very big
pessimist that people want to be educated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, and my whole career, I firmly believe
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I started getting my live feed
going and I see how many people are coming
[SPEAKER_05]: in now to learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only reason people come to my live
feed is because they want to learn about
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to learn about strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what it's, what's been
established as a place people can come
[SPEAKER_05]: actually ask questions about breeding and
actual breeding and learn about strains as
[SPEAKER_05]: opposed to just sitting there watching me
dab because I'm not into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I, I see a lot of breeders
come on, do live feeds and all they do is
[SPEAKER_05]: dab and fucking, I, I'm not into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not, that's not what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we all smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not impressing anyone by fucking
hitting the bong or dabbing, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to be able to answer real
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that it's getting more and
more popular every day blows my fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it shows I'm not exactly right.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were wanting to be educated.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just didn't have anywhere to go get
this education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, I'm not the all knowing
narrator, so I want more breeders to do
[SPEAKER_05]: what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want more people that are, that have a
big platform in the breeding community,
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to do live feeds, answering
breeding questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it will also show people,
the guys that don't, they're not doing it
[SPEAKER_05]: because they have no fucking real
experience or education in any of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're just pulling the wool over
your eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I implore all the breeders to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke will do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he comes on, talks, you know,
Karma's done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Karma's come on with me and
talked to people about breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Caleb will talk to people about breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's very few people who will.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that speaks volumes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people want this education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's give it to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more people that are educated,
the more breeders doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it doesn't scare me for other
breeders to do live feeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the more people being educated by
the larger amount of us, the better for
[SPEAKER_05]: all of us, the better for breeding,
the better for cannabis, the more
[SPEAKER_05]: education that goes out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do you feel about the advent of
kind of like people who will say,
[SPEAKER_00]: go live with me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's settle this beef right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it live.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems almost like reminiscent
of like the WWF you've been calling for
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, one of my friends does
does the whole go live with me,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a part of his character.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love seeing characters in this
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it keeps it interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it keeps it creative.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like people always looked at me
like the villain for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I at first I was kind of I didn't love
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like I don't feel like I'm
a total villain.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I embraced it, I started fucking
loving it, dude, you know, and and people
[SPEAKER_05]: look to me to be this villainous type
character.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they get to know me, they see that
maybe that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think characters make make for
interesting tales.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our tale of breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our era.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inevitably, when are we going to see
the real deal weed wrestling federation
[SPEAKER_00]: where breeders settle beefs in the ring?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been dying for that, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been dying, dying, dying to do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I go to these these events,
you know, like people look at me and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: short and fat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I think they think that I'm going to
not be the person that I am, that I that I
[SPEAKER_05]: am on the live feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm unfortunately for them,
I am every bit the same person that I that
[SPEAKER_05]: I that I profess to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like I, you know, I've learned that
people in our community that like to act
[SPEAKER_05]: tough and talk tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw you saw yourself at the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were right there with me as one little
fucking Golden Coast hunkered down in a
[SPEAKER_05]: corner after he got fucking treated like a
little bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I couldn't punch him because he
was going to sue me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what usually happens at the
last one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Joint breath came up to the table,
acted like he was going to get tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skunk Tech was right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a pretty cute little little dance
we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took all the weapons out of my pockets,
laid them on the table so he knew that
[SPEAKER_05]: there were no fucking weapons in my
pockets.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, bring it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Motherfucker scurried away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if we'll ever have this
event because so so many people are such
[SPEAKER_05]: pussies and so scared to get hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think like we could we could sell
tickets to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could donate that to fuck the money to
good fucking funds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I think it would be funny
as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would get rid of a lot of the
animosity in our community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I I I'm pretty open to say
what I feel about people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I realize that the
division in our community sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does suck.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, we have to get rid
of the trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before we can be united, we have to
divide and conquer the fucking the retards
[SPEAKER_05]: and the scam artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, first fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be the matchmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be your wrestling name is
The Trash Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take out the trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm down for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be The Trash Man versus Flat
Earth Crew, aka Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I don't know if that one
would be able to be public.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might get a little more bloody than
people would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since our last talk, have you had any
interactions with the GGG crew?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had interactions specifically
with Keyplay, who used to be a good friend
[SPEAKER_05]: of mine many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave him his start in breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave him his start.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a company, given him a big push,
got him on the attitude, got him in books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gage Green, for all intents and purposes,
would not be where it's at without that
[SPEAKER_05]: big fucking push that they got from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll say that till the day I die.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows that that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, he he won't speak to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time we spoke was many, many years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when he tried shaking me down,
telling me people know we're friends and
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll believe anything I say about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me money and give me strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who that dude is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who he is at his base.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one kid, Jason Fong or Michael,
whatever he calls himself now,
[SPEAKER_05]: the little scrawny Asian brat,
he wasn't around during all this.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was not around.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had nothing to do with anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know much about him,
but he seems to be the one talking the
[SPEAKER_05]: most shit about me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's not, it's not ideal for him to do
that because he's all of 40 pounds soaking
[SPEAKER_05]: wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't have much interaction with
them other than seeing like every once in
[SPEAKER_05]: a while they'll post like this seed list
where things are like four thousand,
[SPEAKER_05]: five thousand dollars and talking about
flat earth and just weird shit like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dinosaurs never existing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I try to have as little interaction
with those idiots as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I'm at these events, I go around
looking for him just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I would I would love for
them to tell their story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that would be an interesting
one to hear, but something I've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring up, you know, to be fair,
I like I like to, you know, try to be fair
[SPEAKER_00]: where I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to know, do you agree with
this kind of observation in that I'm of
[SPEAKER_00]: the opinion that they kind of got screwed
with Mendo breath, you know, like at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day, I think it's a killer
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're good plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like everyone picked up that
work and ran with it except for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder, was that them just missing
the boat on their own strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they rarely get a mention in the
genesis of it or even just in the context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't help but feel like they kind
of got the short end of the stick in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to a strain they made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you see it a little differently?
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a little differently because I had
already made a strain similar to that
[SPEAKER_05]: using the OGKB before the Mendo breath was
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was already out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were using that, the 26 cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't catch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did not catch on like their Mendo
breath did.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for goddamn sure, because Mendo
breath is literally everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they dropped the ball on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they were too focused on the
negative aspects and fighting with people
[SPEAKER_05]: as opposed to putting their nose to the
grindstone and making it making it their
[SPEAKER_05]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was one of the few strains
that wasn't from Jojo, wasn't from me,
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't from medic seed collection,
wasn't from Loompa that they weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: renaming and weren't doing that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something that they actually made.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, they missed the boat on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's their own fault because they
were just so focused on fighting with
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not just that, they were fighting with
other people about flatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were fighting with people about shit
that had nothing to do with anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I think the reason people don't
mention it is because of all their bad
[SPEAKER_05]: energy attached to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wants to to bring their name up and
shit because it just brings so many bad
[SPEAKER_05]: vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd have to agree for a crew that
goes around espousing that they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: about good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to put out a lot of negative
vibes themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's the irony of it all,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people people pull the hippie
dippy bullshit to try to because they know
[SPEAKER_05]: that catches on in the Kana community.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are into that,
you know, peace and love stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they don't really espouse it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you see guys like Bodhi that
really do that are absolutely,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, all about the earth and paying
attention to the energy of everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they live their life that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it shows the amount of love that he
gets and the amount of love that they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep getting a bit more edgy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about breeders who espouse
the random shit we hear like from Gage
[SPEAKER_00]: Green?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, I mean, I read a post the
other day from Feng Shen, however you say
[SPEAKER_00]: his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason Fung.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Fung.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please come on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's coming on after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read a post talking about,
like, if you eat berries and shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll purify your lymphatic system and it
can cure cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's like Caps Famous Chem Travel
Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel when people kind of take a
foot off the edge with some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: claims?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, being that they claim to
be breeders, they should be science
[SPEAKER_05]: driven.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're science driven, you know
that, you know, you have to go through
[SPEAKER_05]: trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have things be able to be
repeatable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to, you know, I mean,
like there's a there's a method,
[SPEAKER_05]: a scientific method for a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they are breeders, if they are
scientists, they would probably think a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit more before they speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just shows like it shows their
competency level.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows all that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, you know, I myself have
been called a conspiracy theorist by
[SPEAKER_05]: Philos and many other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a sense, you know, I've studied a
lot of that stuff, but I've also studied
[SPEAKER_05]: it because I like to know before I speak
on things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I have my own views on fucking
aliens and UFOs and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I don't think it really has
much to do with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, final question on our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage, you know, recently they put a post
up saying that they had received an offer
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past for 15 million dollars for
their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said they turned it down because
GGG is worth more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give your interpretation of
that situation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those broke motherfuckers didn't get no 15
million dollar offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would have sucked the dick of fucking
whoever was giving it to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't buy it at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's given them a 15 million dollar
offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like from the way they're charging for
their strains, dude, and how many times
[SPEAKER_05]: they've been hit for doing illegal shit,
you know, not just not just growing weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: but other shit, you know, they get
involved with meth, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think they would have sold out
right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't give a fuck about this
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone offered him 15 million,
they would have done anything for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't buy that shit at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it makes a nice story.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's it's trying to convince people
of their value that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, to kind of change to
a slightly different topic, given that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is this prevalence for people to
kind of be more compassionate,
[SPEAKER_00]: centric within our community, you know,
like there's not a lot of purely
[SPEAKER_00]: businessmen within our scene, at least not
ones that are embraced.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel like breeders are going to
be able to survive moving forward given
[SPEAKER_00]: the advent of what seems like an
inevitable commercialization and like a
[SPEAKER_00]: big ag takeover of things?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those of us who thrived in the black
market long before all this in the early
[SPEAKER_05]: forum days and whatnot, that's how we made
our name, you know, getting on the forums,
[SPEAKER_05]: passing stuff out, selling stuff through
word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be fine, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how we've always rolled.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the big ag takeover, they may
take over recreational and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people eventually realize,
like, there's always going to be a demand
[SPEAKER_05]: for quality weed and you're not going to
get that from Walmart weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and it raises another point I had
about, you know, vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so on the rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will hate on them,
but a lot of people will also point out
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are kind of like a stepping
stone between the connoisseur community
[SPEAKER_00]: and just the casual enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about the old pussy
sticks?
[SPEAKER_04]: The old pussy sticks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I vape nicotine, you know, so I guess I'm
kind of involved in that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just because I think cigarettes
are stinky and I don't want to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, with cannabis, yeah, there's a
lot of people that will do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never smoke a joint because they still
have that fear of associating with
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's always going to be a demand for
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think eventually there it'll be a
bigger demand for it worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the younger community is going
to keep going that direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there will always be a connoisseur
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those that that breed connoisseur
seeds, they're going to have to fight for
[SPEAKER_05]: those positions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people that are fucking not really
good at breeding and just preyed upon
[SPEAKER_05]: people's, you know, like the average high
times reader, they're going to fall down
[SPEAKER_05]: in that market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only going to be a few people
making that market and they're definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: not going to be anything in the
connoisseur market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the kind of people that are
going to fall off and not be around.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like people like me, people like
Bodhi, people like CSI, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: around doing this long after the money's
gone, long after, you know, the interest
[SPEAKER_05]: is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is who we are, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around that same debate of the vape
pens, we have this like a sub debate
[SPEAKER_00]: around whether the introduction of
cannabis derived terpenes to these carts
[SPEAKER_00]: is like a good or a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a further sub debate of like,
well, are those terpenes cannabis derived?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they derived from other sources like
natural sources, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have much of an opinion on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the very specific question is,
do you feel like externally added terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of like detrimental to a product
or like kind of reduce it from what it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think scientifically finding out that
cannabis derived terpenes are indeed
[SPEAKER_05]: different than like fruit derived terpenes
or from other places.
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally, initially, they said that a
terpene is a terpene is a terpene,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Limonene is limonene is limonene no matter
where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not, they're finding out that's
not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: The entourage effect is very real.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these hot dog carts, the vape
carts, hot dog water carts, whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: they're called.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that, I think that's the nickname.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like you smoke them and you'll
get the same high that you would get from
[SPEAKER_05]: say poorly extracted BHO to where
everything is stripped.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the terpenes are stripped.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the same high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, it's kind of speedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bland.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really super enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The entourage effect is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need cannabis derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether, and I don't know that whether
extracting it from cannabis and then
[SPEAKER_05]: re-adding it if there's something that is
missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't speak to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never really, I don't think a lot of
these people that are claiming that they
[SPEAKER_05]: have cannabis derived terpenes are really
going that route because it's cheaper to
[SPEAKER_05]: get fruit extracted terpenes than it is
from cannabis extracted terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people are going the easier
route and saying it's cannabis extracted
[SPEAKER_05]: because there's no way to really prove
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot of shortcuts
being taken and that's just going to
[SPEAKER_05]: happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the nature of business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to try to take advantage
of people at every step to save a buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you feel about the idea of some
of the more well-known and let's just say
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted breeders within our community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing work for big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have a feeling it's inevitable
where someone's like, Oh, I'm creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid that's going to be planted in
fields and it's going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just harvested by big combines all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like that would be a negative
thing or it's kind of like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: we may as well meet him in the middle if
it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's such a hard one, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've been watching some of my friends
that I respect slowly drift over to the
[SPEAKER_05]: corporate world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these people are people that
have been through the really big hardships
[SPEAKER_05]: of getting popped, watching their family
get thrown on the floor by DEA agents,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and, and, uh, back during the
really illegal days watching their,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, watching their family go through
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally having an avenue to not
have to worry about that again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get the want for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, with that said, it's a personal
decision and it's definitely not for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: not fucking for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no amount of money is worth fucking
selling all my friends down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really that's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a, you may think it's only
affecting you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only one person, but if everybody
starts making those moves, it's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: start taking out a lot of your friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to make a lot of your friends
lives a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that, that, that's exactly what's gone
on with Philos as we've watched it,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is another hot button topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, just to kind of jump off the
old doom and gloom big ag situation
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier on, you mentioned when we were
talking about the, uh, the skunk spray
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani seeds that they were from like the
late eighties, early nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you said from memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any other stock left from back
in that timeframe that you kind of itching
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a bunch of stuff from that
individual bite me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he gave me so many, like I think 13 or
14 different things, only three or four
[SPEAKER_05]: were labeled.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest are supposed to be, you know,
Colombian golds, Colombian blacks,
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombian reds, Colombian rainbows,
and then other Nepalese different things
[SPEAKER_05]: that were coming down the pipe in Florida
during that era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I have stuff from that I've saved
from my own collection that I've gotten
[SPEAKER_05]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but a lot of those seeds are really
hard to pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to take tissue culture
popping and that in itself has become
[SPEAKER_05]: another problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of scammers in that world
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they realize that there's money to
be made there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They realize that, you know, some breeders
like me, I'm not on top of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know all the ins and outs of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really easy to take advantage of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I hope that, you know,
more people step forward finest has been
[SPEAKER_05]: really kind to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, and there's other people,
Mike Hydro is doing fucking great work
[SPEAKER_05]: with Jungle Boys and tissue culture stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you just mentioned finest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had heard from some people that they got
caught with their pants down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup in terms of like some of the
cuts they were selling were like had
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard anything about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, with tissue culture comes an
issue that you have to use certain
[SPEAKER_05]: hormones in order to make them go through
that process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those cuts aren't necessarily
the best for cropping.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say you buy a thousand cuts just to
bloom out right away, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: from that have been tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been treated with so many hormones
and it takes X amount of months for that
[SPEAKER_05]: to happen, to get it out of its system
before he can bloom it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's some of the issues
they're running into.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some people said PM and stuff like
that at the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when you bring,
um, clean clones, very sterile clones into
[SPEAKER_05]: an environment where there's a bunch of
rollers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walking around from their rooms,
you're going to get shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know how people can sell
clones at events like that and not worry
[SPEAKER_05]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely feels like a good choice to
maybe quarantine those bad boys off
[SPEAKER_00]: initially.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Treat them with some micronized sulfur,
put them in a corner for a while,
[SPEAKER_05]: treat them again, figure it out before you
bring them in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given so many of your strains have been
used by other breeders to kind of make new
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever found yourself in a
situation where you made a strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you released it, everything's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of forgot about it and
then someone's used it and they've made
[SPEAKER_00]: like a new hybrid and it's kind of like
really got some jazz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, damn, maybe I need to go
back and pull out those seeds again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe I kind of pulled the plug on
that a little early in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have explored that one a bit
more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like when people do that and they find
their own special shit in it and they,
[SPEAKER_05]: they hybridize it and find something that
they love in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point I'm usually my mindset
is, wow, I'm glad they found something
[SPEAKER_05]: special in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they take it a new direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that I've left it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I've left it behind, then I've left it
behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that it's very rare that I pick
up an old strain and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: wow, there was a lot more in that I should
have looked for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's very rare that that happens
because I do good, I do good pops of my
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff to go through enough, you know,
to see it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes what they find that they
love and that other people love isn't what
[SPEAKER_05]: I love.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I, and also I look at everybody who
buys my seeds, like they're investing in
[SPEAKER_05]: my company and I, they're buying rights to
use those lines as they see fit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, they have the option to
reproduce them if they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily going to get the best
reaction if they're like reproducing it to
[SPEAKER_05]: undercut me on price and, you know,
keeping the same name and all that shit,
[SPEAKER_05]: because, uh, it may not be a good
representation of where I wanted the line
[SPEAKER_05]: to go, but, um, you know, it's all part of
the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all a part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I, I think the highest honor is
someone carrying on a strain and using it
[SPEAKER_05]: and finding something special in it that
they love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever consider remaking one of
your previous strains that you maybe were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thinking was just going to be a
one-off, but you were like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is actually something special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberry switch blade was one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it was one that I made as a one-off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually I have a direction, uh,
and a goal with everything that I put in a
[SPEAKER_05]: room that I'm, that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't put anything in there usually
for, you know, just cause there's space
[SPEAKER_05]: throw it in there for shits and gigs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in that case, that is the one time
when I did that and it became something
[SPEAKER_05]: that people really truly love.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went back, worked that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, that was, that was an anomaly
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would you describe your general
approach to new projects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just kind of, everything just kind
of comes organically and just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you do it yourself or do you
have like more of like a methodical,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a whiteboard, like I'm kind of
mapping things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you approach it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a, a brain where everything's just
chaos.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have any whiteboards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any, any, any like notepads
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: My, my chick's laughing cause she knows
how chaotic I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, it's everything is just kind of
off the cuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I see what I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I'll hit a mental block and I
don't do anything for a year because I
[SPEAKER_05]: just don't have any creative juices
flowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing's, nothing's coming from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't like to make things just to
make things, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think there's probably a few
breeders who have been guilty of putting
[SPEAKER_00]: out some stuff that fits that criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of people message me,
asking me about why Top Dog as a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: is still so popular despite the fact,
like a lot of the crosses have produced
[SPEAKER_00]: like less than ideal results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, why, why does he have such a
diehard fandom?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I totally respect
everything JJ has done for the scene and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of Money Mike's work is really well
received, but it seems like some of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the newer stuff put out by JJ is
a bit hit and miss, maybe more of a miss.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, JJ has been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's, I think a lot of us old guys,
including myself, it's a, it's a struggle
[SPEAKER_05]: to stay relevant, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we realized that as much as we want to
relive that, you know, work lines hard,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, take several years to work a line
properly and release it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what the, the community and the
seed buying public really demands.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want something new, shiny in front of
their face all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's, it's a struggle to stay
relevant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a struggle to keep your name out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that always runs the risk of releasing
something that is subpar, that comes back
[SPEAKER_05]: and affects your legacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, JJ is very fortunate that he made
stardom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he has the, the I 95, um, Chem Di 95
has been a very popular one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've, I've worked with his white dog,
which I think is totally underrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: His DDNL lines, his DNL releases are
totally underrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, yeah, I think it's just like a
lot of us old guys are trying to find a
[SPEAKER_05]: way to stay relevant in a time where,
in a time of cookies and wedding cake,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, uh, in a time of all that shit
that has no interest to us at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trying to, to meld that into breeding
that we do, um, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's a hard world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hard, brutal world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, he had the popularity of
being in high times, a bunch getting all
[SPEAKER_05]: these kinds of, uh, uh, nods and stuff
from high times saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: best breeder this year, best breeder of
that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of that was real, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was, he was really making his mark on
the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that comes a demand from the seed
buying public and new customers to,
[SPEAKER_05]: to want new, why aren't you using the
wedding cakes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't you using the cookies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't you using this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, why, why am I having to wait for
this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so yeah, it's, it's hard to temper
those two things and, and we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: finding our, our ways of, of working
through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some, you know, I, I've hit speed
bumps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he has.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, you know, I put out stuff some
people don't like, and it is a personal
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also, uh, JJ has a lot of newer
growers that buy his stuff that maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't the best growers too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why you're not seeing,
um, uh, a majority of the stuff come out
[SPEAKER_05]: as good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because his, his clientele has
changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before it was a lot of breeders buying his
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's a lot of, uh, modern growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, and, you know, JJ will even admit
sometimes he reacts to things a little,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, I try to think of the word for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he reacts pretty quickly to stuff and
I have that same issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't, it's not like I'm throwing him
under the bus for reacting to shit,
[SPEAKER_05]: like kind of hot headedly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he's a passionate man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people talk shit about what he's
doing, he's passionate about it and gives
[SPEAKER_05]: it back to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and of course, with that comes
backlash.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't like being talked to like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had that same problem myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I grew out his skunk OG and I
found a keeper in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the overwhelming feedback I get is
that people tend to be a little less than
[SPEAKER_00]: thrilled with some of the results they
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess in a, in a sense,
a lot of people point to this factor of
[SPEAKER_00]: how he doesn't keep males.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses like a new male every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will often reference how like
the first star dog release was like this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then subsequent ones have not been as
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like overall, this is a good
strategy or it might be actually working
[SPEAKER_00]: against the people employing it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I don't keep a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to keep males, but I lost a lot
during the moon thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lost some when I moved from San Diego
back to Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't keep a lot of males around
long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I do one good run with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll keep them around just in case as best
I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I don't, I don't, but I also take
the time to select them, which is really
[SPEAKER_05]: important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you want it, you want to run them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, you, you don't know if a male is good
or not till you run the progeny.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just a fact, you know,
um, that said, I don't like to,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's say I have bubblegum cookies and I
use, uh, whatever male for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I then want to make bubblegum
cookies cause it has a, uh, awesome
[SPEAKER_05]: reception and then put out the same name.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I always have to denote it
with a V2 if I'm using a different male
[SPEAKER_05]: for that run or, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people can differentiate between the
two and don't think they're getting the
[SPEAKER_05]: same first product or, um, if it's a
filial generation, like an F2 or F3 or F4
[SPEAKER_05]: of whatever I'm doing, I like to denote
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they know they're not getting the F1
and not going to see the same exact
[SPEAKER_05]: results that the F1 got.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important to clarify that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I guess a final little kind of
question I wanted to tease out based
[SPEAKER_00]: around this is I'd heard a while back and
admittedly I should probably just message
[SPEAKER_00]: High and Lonesome and find out,
but I'd heard that maybe some people from
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole New York crew had politely
asked High and Lonesome to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: quit with these awesome TresDog hybrids
because, you know, like the Appalachia,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the dog waltz, they were phenomenal
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the idea was like,
you know, maybe he was doing a better job
[SPEAKER_00]: than they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you feel about that idea that,
you know, maybe they politely asked him to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop breeding with that work?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a little bit of the inside on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what High and Lonesome would
want me to disclose because he's so
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking laid back.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't give a fuck about anything
drama wise.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do know that he was asked to work
with a certain company that you,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that we had just recently
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wasn't really into it just because
he's kind of a lobo.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a lone wolf, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that might be why they then kind of
twisted the narrative to sound like they
[SPEAKER_05]: asked him to stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more his choice to just kind of
walk away from everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: He left.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just wasn't into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you noticed, a lot of people
thought dog waltz was JJ's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people thought that for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know that anyone ever took the
time to say, no, no, that's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually High and Lonesome's,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's disappointing over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that dude is one of the coolest
motherfuckers I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a legit old school dude, old school
Virginia dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really cool motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I have all the respect in the
world for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that he asked me to continue
the Appalachia line for him, that was what
[SPEAKER_05]: an honor, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had the honor of going and getting
him back.
[SPEAKER_05]: The poodle nuts cut of the dog waltz.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's that's one guy I really,
really respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that they asked him to not
work that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might have felt like that and that it
was showing up some of the work that was
[SPEAKER_05]: being released with the Trey dog and stuff
like that.
But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think I'm probably of the same
opinion, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was probably never expressed,
but they probably they probably felt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will admit, you know, in one of the
very early interviews I think I attributed
[SPEAKER_00]: dog waltz to Mass G of all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, you know, I'm just as guilty as
every one of these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know that G did much
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of accidents happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still trying to get and you know,
Mass G is one of my buddies, dude,
[SPEAKER_05]: like we've been friends for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but I still can't get the answer from
him about Giesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: When was it created?
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like a simple answer, but I cannot
get a lot of answers out of that,
[SPEAKER_05]: dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't get the answers about Chem D and
why they're so many different Chem D's
[SPEAKER_05]: that all came sourced from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of a lot of questions that
go around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because he's my buddy, I don't I don't
put the the screws to him too hard about
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a young dude when all the chem
stuff happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I think if people realized how
young he was when all that happened,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of the expectations that they have
for how stuff was handled would go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a super nice dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Mass G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always remind myself of that,
you know, like no matter what anyone has
[SPEAKER_00]: to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the story or the gaps in it or
whatever, like dude was 17 when he popped
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, fuck me, when I was 17, I couldn't
even keep a plan alive, let alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: let alone preserve it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like so much credit to that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and then there's other
things like certain people that were
[SPEAKER_05]: involved during that first transaction
that hang around and verify people's cuts
[SPEAKER_05]: for them that really don't know shit about
shit when it comes to the chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: But have attached their name permanently
to the chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't tell you how many people I've
had come to me saying, well, this person
[SPEAKER_05]: verified this cut for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they're part of the early
chem fam.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm pretty sure it's legit,
you know, and that same person handing out
[SPEAKER_05]: cuts to dickheads like joint breath and
others that there's there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: frustrating stuff and a lot of a lot of
weird expectations, a lot of weird
[SPEAKER_05]: assumptions made with how the chem family
stuff operated in the early days and how
[SPEAKER_05]: how attached these guys really were to
each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much they interacted, how much they
actually bred and how much were accidents.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, G was young, man,
like I would love to hear the true tale of
[SPEAKER_05]: D, the chem D.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to hear the true tale of all
of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know that we'll ever hear
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's a shame because I think
it would be an interesting story to hear
[SPEAKER_05]: the actual facts of each D and how it came
to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: What really happened with the sister?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was a sister S1?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why was that used as the D?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why was that passed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the D etc.?
[SPEAKER_05]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've always personally felt like Joe
Brand could probably fill some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, I've been told by too
many sources that you just can't trust
[SPEAKER_00]: what he says.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's off the rails and that's
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's real unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it just is what it is with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's life, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of change things up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the last time we spoke, you're now
vending through some seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Seeds Here Now and James Bean,
friends of both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this come about and how does it
feel to now be affiliated with two rather
[SPEAKER_00]: big seed banks, most notably Seeds Here
Now?
[SPEAKER_05]: After the moon situation, during that
time, I've always been protective about
[SPEAKER_05]: who my merchant account was because it's
really hard for breeders and seed sellers
[SPEAKER_05]: to have a merchant account.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something you have to guard with
your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I take chances on friends and Mooney
and his buddy, I can't remember the dude's
[SPEAKER_05]: name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really important, but they wanted to
start a seed company and because I trusted
[SPEAKER_05]: them, he had my mom's and was taking care
of them for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, I told them who my merchant
account was and the second that I found
[SPEAKER_05]: out my plants were dead, I got reported to
my merchant account for selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I lost that and I lost the ability to
accept credit cards and in this world,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you can't accept credit cards,
it's a really hard road to travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people, these are impulse buys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll make an order and won't send the
cash because it takes a lot of effort and
[SPEAKER_05]: we're all a bunch of fucking stoners and
that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really important to have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also during that time, I mean,
early on, me and James were not really
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very judgmental of James because of
who he was associated with when he first
[SPEAKER_05]: came into the business.
[SPEAKER_05]: But over the years, I've watched James
work really hard to get to the point of
[SPEAKER_05]: where he's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: That dude fucking hustles nonstop,
nonstop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And over the years, even though we argue
and shit, I've always had an appreciation
[SPEAKER_05]: for how hard he's worked and if people
work and pay their dues, dude,
[SPEAKER_05]: who am I to fucking judge them?
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that said, when all that happened,
me and James started talking and we had
[SPEAKER_05]: talked about working together for a bit,
but we just kind of went, eh, hemden ha.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't quite trust me because I've
called him a fucking retard publicly
[SPEAKER_05]: plenty of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't really trust him because I
don't trust seed banks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've had a lot of bad interactions in
the old days with European seed banks,
[SPEAKER_05]: the attitude, serious seeds, or not
serious, I'm sorry, not serious seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: sensible seeds, different than the
original sensible seed bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sensible seeds, they scam me out of 20
grand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had Trichome Kings, NYC Kid aka TH
underscore gobs, that piece of shit who
[SPEAKER_05]: pretends he has Asian fantasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had him scam me out of fucking tens of
thousands of dollars along with,
[SPEAKER_05]: he scammed the rev, he scammed a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been a hard world trusting seed
banks.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I eventually tried it with James and
it's been working great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been working awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been true to his word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything he said he'd do, he's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I also work with Breeders Direct
Seed Co, who is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of helping him get established.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's doing it right, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's only picking up breeders that,
for the most part, there may be a few odds
[SPEAKER_05]: and ends of people that aren't really,
haven't been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, I mean,
he's got me, CSI, he's picking up
[SPEAKER_05]: Pipsweed, El Jefe, like a lot of people
like that, that are older breeders and are
[SPEAKER_05]: established and he's trying to do it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, yeah, I can echo the
sentiments about CT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they've always been really awesome in
regards to our relationship and James in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I know many, if any people
who hustle harder than that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the king of the hustle, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: King of the hustle, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed for a while, you know,
as I mentioned earlier, I love your
[SPEAKER_00]: feminizing spray that there was basically
like some issues with like payment
[SPEAKER_00]: gateways and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I was wondering is how hard is
it to operate a kind of business giving
[SPEAKER_00]: like the range of limitations that like
financial institutions place on us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I mean, you must have patience
beyond words given that whole debacle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I constantly have a worry in my gut every
morning that I'm going to wake up with an
[SPEAKER_05]: email saying, you're no longer active with
a merchant account because it's really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really hard to get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now with hemp being legal,
people are more open minded to the seed
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it hasn't always been that way,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I get a lot of requests
from a lot of breeders asking me,
[SPEAKER_05]: how the fuck are you pulling this off?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, after the moon situation,
I don't say shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I can't trust anyone with my
merchant account shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's hard, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a lot of patience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things will go down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and frankly, just accepting cash is
not a working model for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's about a 10 percent follow through
rate on on orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I've told other breeders
this that are big that go that route.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've confirmed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten percent follow through rate on orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means 90 percent of the people who
order aren't going to pay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's defeating.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like you see all these orders
come through.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you're doing a big drop of something
really special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety percent of those orders of it are
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you stop you apportion this amount
of seeds for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden, you know,
three weeks down the line, you have them
[SPEAKER_05]: to have to resell a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are calling you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said you were only going to make so
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you selling it again?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they don't understand the ins
and outs of the cash business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a merchant account is everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these same kind of financial
restrictions that we're talking about were
[SPEAKER_00]: basically imposed on last year's Emerald
Cup, which I think prior to the most
[SPEAKER_00]: recent one was a really good event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last year, you know, it felt
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there wasn't the same energy in
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it just wasn't the same event,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel these events are going to
go down in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you plan to go to the next Emerald
Cup?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have personal feelings about the people
behind Emerald Cup that put it on that
[SPEAKER_05]: make me not want to work with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I think they are the same kind of
guys bringing shitheads like Phylos
[SPEAKER_05]: around, backing them up and bringing
scummy CEO types and saying they're cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, let's work with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big money event.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was bound to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year was not remotely the same
feeling as the first one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one, I mean, it's stressful
being around a bunch of people,
[SPEAKER_05]: as is having a bunch of people come up to
you that know what you look like and you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know who they are, what they look
like or what their agendas or intentions
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: This last one, dude, I felt sick when I
was in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had never my live feed wasn't as big
the first year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second year, like last year,
this most recent one when I was walking
[SPEAKER_05]: around, I was getting grabbed every few
seconds and and being in a crowd of that
[SPEAKER_05]: many people and getting grabbed from all
angles.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little intimidating, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you don't know who's going to fucking
shank you in your back or want to shake
[SPEAKER_05]: your hand for that matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was a different energy all
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very corporatized.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not it wasn't anything that I
really liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be at the Emerald Cup, but not
necessarily I'll be in the city of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may not attend next year's Emerald Cup,
but I'll be there throwing throwing our
[SPEAKER_05]: little shin dig, of course, that we are
now making annual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, something to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, it's going to be I mean,
last year it was kind of put together at
[SPEAKER_05]: the last minute, you know, and we weren't
sure who was going to show up.
[SPEAKER_05]: One person tried to hijack the whole thing
and saying that there was a fucking DUI
[SPEAKER_05]: checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one go there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to my party.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I had a little I had a little
Instagram like circle, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: where where a bunch of us were in the
message.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we were communicating about
what was going to happen, where it was
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last minute after the Emerald Cup,
when everybody was about to go,
[SPEAKER_05]: someone's like, hey, DUI checkpoint,
everybody watch out, which there was no
[SPEAKER_05]: DUI checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were like, hey, come to this
barbecue place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, opportunistic, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just just relating back to the
point about the Emerald Cup itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd heard some whispers from people that
like, you know, basically there was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: small, if not large consensus from
breeders that they were possibly going to
[SPEAKER_00]: shrug off the next Emerald Cup and go to
the Cup that was being held in mass on
[SPEAKER_00]: that same weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You given any thought to that one at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, if you heard that there was a
sizeable group of people doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: would you consider doing that?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because we have our party and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know that one person in particular
was trying to push everyone in that
[SPEAKER_05]: direction and saying that this person and
that person was going to be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I talked to the actual people and
they're like, no, I'm not going there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think one person in particular is
trying to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there should be events going on at
both places and stuff, but we have we have
[SPEAKER_05]: our annual party now, the Canna Luminati
party.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to drag people in if they were
being allured by that other offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a little bit off topic, but I really,
really, really want to delve into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the lines from other
breeders coming out in the future that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're aware of that you're looking
forward to?
[SPEAKER_05]: CSI, a lot of the stuff he's been doing,
the Triangle Kush S1s, his old family
[SPEAKER_05]: purple reversals and the Trump reversals,
those are going to be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't make any secret of it that him and
Bodhi are like my top two favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I consider CSI kind of a mentor,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's he's he's he's hard to get close
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's very hard to get close to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of scammers and stuff and he
doesn't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't blame him.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we started becoming good friends,
he really has taken care of me,
[SPEAKER_05]: brought me in, put me where I needed to
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to meet a lot of people that I that I
should have been already met, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: his lines, he tests, he tests way more
seeds than I even do.
[SPEAKER_05]: He does large populations of pops before
they're ever released.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ABC, that's a line I've hunted for
over a decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been on hunting it for probably two
decades, hunting the ABC, the Australian
[SPEAKER_05]: Bastard Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people don't see the value in
it because it's weird looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of hempy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot more value to strains
than just recreational potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking forward to that a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something a lot of people have been
hunting and he managed to bring to bring
[SPEAKER_05]: forward with Painted Forest Farms,
which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a young guy getting into this scene
that happened to stumble upon that and and
[SPEAKER_05]: is making his name with it, which is
really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like he's taken a genuine
interest in cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need more young people like that
doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping with the DJ short work with the
new berry and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to see a return to the old
blue sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope that that's going to be the
case with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some of my friends, El Jefe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing Chem 91 work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really, really proud of him and the BX
work he's doing with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to see Skunk VA doing some
projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone worked with that line that long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really stoked to see his work that he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The creator of Mendo perps, the one who
brought it to the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: See who else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pip Swede, one of my one of my best
friends, his Irene Sour Diesel stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've smoked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking killer, killer, killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing a lot of sour work,
a lot of Irene work, a lot of Death Star
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's new to seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's behind Breeders Direct Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's working a lot of hype lines,
but he's trying to keep them unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I applaud him for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably forgetting a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so much to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the first one which piqued my ears
when you mentioned it was how I totally
[SPEAKER_00]: forgot CSI, who I totally agree,
an amazing breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that cutting there, you know,
the keeper one that he calls the Trump or
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, it's got the word Trump in
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting to see the
backlash, like how many people are so
[SPEAKER_00]: against Trump as a politician that they
were like willing to boycott this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fucking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, the old family purple,
like, jeez, that's some good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you think about like people
just being put off a strain purely because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the name?
[SPEAKER_05]: They must not understand the history of
how that name came up with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was done by our buddy Redbeard at
Portland CSI.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say his real name,
but yeah, he did the Obama Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's responsible for the Obama Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: He selected that cut, made his name with
that cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also selected the Trump and named it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't Caleb who named it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was because he had an Obama.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was made during that era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have the Trump.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean he supports him in any
way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think most breeders would be a
huge Trump supporter just because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: pushback from corporatocracy, you know,
that's invading our community.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't support any politicians.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they should all be hung.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anarchy, Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're all dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you know, I think if they
understood that it wasn't necessarily like
[SPEAKER_05]: a pro-Trump move, it was just because the
first one was named Obama, the second one
[SPEAKER_05]: named Trump.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why, you know, I think if they
understood that it would be a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned Pipsweed working with the
Irene Sauer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting because a lot of people
talk very highly of Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it also goes quite, you know,
it's not as well known among the circles
[SPEAKER_00]: as a lot of other cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And combined with the Sauer, like it's
like a powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like these two really highly regarded
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you think we can expect to see
some of that going live?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Pip is another one that he's a
perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're a perfectionist in the
artistic breeding world, you want to make
[SPEAKER_05]: sure everything's fucking sound and he
will not release that shit until it's
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I think in the next year,
you're going to see the Irene Sauer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene, I think, isn't as used because it's
not as photogenic as a lot of other cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a beautiful cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very resinous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very awkward looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look like most OG cushions,
but the turps on that shit is crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a beautiful high and it breeds
really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, it has a better structure than
most OG cushions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it has some bubba in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like it might have something
else in it, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what else is in it,
but it's most likely an OG bubba across to
[SPEAKER_05]: something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it maintains that that bubba structure
where you don't have to fucking majorly
[SPEAKER_05]: stake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you know what Sauer he used in order
to make these seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a FemCross or did he use,
like, Karma's Sauer release and get,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, a mail from that?
[SPEAKER_05]: He uses, he has a few Sauer's he keeps.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has what's referred to as the Choco or
Cobb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it has a lot of different names,
but that old cut of Sauer, what's
[SPEAKER_05]: considered the Manny cut, the original
cut, which is the original name for the
[SPEAKER_05]: Sauer from the Sauer crew, would be the
Manny cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vondo, I think, is the one that named
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also has a Sauer, I believe,
from ResDog's work that was used to make
[SPEAKER_05]: the original Death Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do believe that is the one that he
used in Irene Sauer Diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: He might have used the Choco cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's done his own Sauer BX work along the
along the lines that Karma did,
[SPEAKER_05]: using obviously a different cut than
Karma's using to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Karma has his own selected cut from
ResDog's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Pip's been doing both the,
I believe, the original Manny cut,
[SPEAKER_05]: Choco cut, and the one used in Death Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been doing back processes using that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think about Karma's Sauer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't I've never smoked or
anything, but I mean, it looks it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: true to form, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It does look like a Sauer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's done a great job with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The head banger and all that stuff came
out beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it came out true to form with a Sauer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, head banger, I think,
is probably the best non-traditional,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I would say modern headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could call it like the Sauer OG
headband as opposed to the Northern Light
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's probably one of the best
releases of a modern headband,
[SPEAKER_05]: line and seat form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are your thoughts on the very
original Sauer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just to clarify, I might be
retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, insert that Alex Jones meme
where it's like, I'm kind of retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like is the original Sauer
around or is that just long gone?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so if you're not retarded,
this has been something that is it's one
[SPEAKER_05]: of the hardest nuts to crack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked to almost everyone involved
except for Manny.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think anyone's really talked
to Manny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vondo and Klopp were roommates back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the story from Vondo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vondo was the one who had the bag of seeds
for Manny and it was labeled Our Diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, their diesel was either Chem 91 or a
bag seed from the Chem 91, which could be
[SPEAKER_05]: a Chem 91 hybrid or an S1 of Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was from seed, supposedly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from that bag of Our Diesel was
selected the Manny cut, which is what we
[SPEAKER_05]: know as the Choco Sauer Diesel today.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best that anybody's put it
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have Michael Klopp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is who is the weasel?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he is given many stories on many
different podcasts that don't quite jive
[SPEAKER_05]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a super nice dude, but I'm not sure
how accurate he remembers it or can retell
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was the partner of or not partner,
but roommate of Vondo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go into details about all
the personal interactions of people dating
[SPEAKER_05]: each other's girlfriends and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Vondo eventually left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vondo left New York, went to Cali,
and it was out of the picture when the
[SPEAKER_05]: weasel started pushing Sauer Diesel,
which was supposedly from the pack of
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds that said Our Diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I don't know how much of that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's one person's recollection
of it, but it was the person who was
[SPEAKER_05]: involved heavily in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of have to tender the human
story with facts and try to put together
[SPEAKER_05]: facts from a bunch of different sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that seems to jive the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like the Sauer to me has like
an even more muddy story than the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so muddy, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just because people have an
agenda.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you have AJ, who has his agenda to
be Mr. Sauer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the weasel who AJ kind of
attributes to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the weasel wants to pretend that he
was more of a breeder in it than it being
[SPEAKER_05]: just kind of happenstance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe he remembers himself being more
of a breeder than he was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people remember shit way
differently looking back.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was a long time ago,
but somewhere in there is the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the one thing that goes in line with
both the 91 and the Sauer to me,
[SPEAKER_05]: in my opinion, is the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: You always see super skunk expressions in
both of those lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the bind that ties, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, it seems to me
like a lot of genetics just tie back to
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk and northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I mean, Afghani 1, skunk 1,
northern lights and haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the basis of almost everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, granted, you have Malawi,
you have other Africans, you have other
[SPEAKER_05]: lines that have been brought in over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the overall gene pool is Afghani 1,
skunk 1, northern lights, super skunk,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like all those baseline haze,
specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the ones that make up a majority
of the population of what we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the final one I wanted to ask you
about, which I always get messages about
[SPEAKER_00]: from, it's a smaller community of
followers, but God, they're passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PIF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the PIF's still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hazar has a PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do believe from people he's given it
to and that I trust their palate,
[SPEAKER_05]: that it is the real PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an old NL5 haze cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Old NL5 haze, and that's all it is,
but it's a very specific cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cut most people are searching for when
they say the word PIF is the Frankie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a lot of different names.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Frankie, the Pude, the Washington
Heights haze, the Uptown haze,
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all referring to a specific haze that
smells like a Catholic church,
[SPEAKER_05]: like the frankincense and myrrh type
smell, along with some metallic,
[SPEAKER_05]: which you'll find in old positronics haze,
along with some ammonia, which are getting
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Northern light aspect in the
Steve Murphy Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what people mostly refer to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's also the mango PIF,
which is an older mango type pheno that
[SPEAKER_05]: came out of the same Northern light five
haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that same similar phenotype
and work in Shanty's mango haze line.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're seeing that same pheno being worked
with similar type highs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, most people see less of the mango
PIF up in New York because it takes a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: longer to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as in high demand as the Frankie
PIF, but now I think the term PIF has been
[SPEAKER_05]: thrown on a lot of bullshit that has
nothing to do with the PIF, the Cuban
[SPEAKER_05]: black haze cut going around.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people call that PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the Frankie specifically,
but people also use the term PIF
[SPEAKER_05]: interchangeably with dank, fire,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I refer to really good weed as that PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big wrapper thing to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of the roundabout story on the
PIF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of those ones where it's just
a bit elusive for most of the general
[SPEAKER_00]: public, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was fortunate to have it early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know what the fuck it was when I
was handed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not from the East coast, so I wasn't
privy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't anything online about the PIF
during that era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody was talking about the PIF during
that era when I got it, but it was from a
[SPEAKER_05]: friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually a nemesis, online nemesis,
the dude that would troll the fuck out of
[SPEAKER_05]: me early on that ended up becoming friends
with me because he had the same passion I
[SPEAKER_05]: did.
[SPEAKER_05]: We eventually saw that in each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, yo, I'm going to hand you these
seeds, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to thank me later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he put the stipulations on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't breed with it pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never release it pure or you're going to
have some Dominicans after your ass and
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know what it was, but when I got
it, when I grew it, when I used it,
[SPEAKER_05]: I realized how special it truly was.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just kind of link back to a point
you made, you mentioned Shanti and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mango in his lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a little sidestep of him for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't all too long ago, maybe a bit
over a month or more, that we sadly saw
[SPEAKER_00]: the passing of Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about Neville given you
had that interaction with him?
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, how do you think he's
going to be remembered?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think his legacy should be?
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville was a complex man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did work with Neville in 2010,
2011 during his resurgence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't friends with him during the
heyday of the seed bank or anything like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm way too young for that, but I did have
the privilege of interacting with him and
[SPEAKER_05]: doing a little bit of work with him during
2010 and 2011.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a complex man.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of guys that operated during that
era had to have some shade to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He may not have been the best at keeping
promises or delivering on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to badmouth him though,
because there is no doubt that cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics would not be where they are now
without the seed bank and his early work
[SPEAKER_05]: and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is an absolute legend in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had the fucking balls to run that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a large set of steel fucking
cojones to fucking pull off running the
[SPEAKER_05]: seed bank like he did in such a gangster
fashion, the cannabis castle.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's his legend, and that's what I hope
he's remembered for.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all have our quirks.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people that don't like
anything about me, and maybe that's
[SPEAKER_05]: justified in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be the same way with
Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all complex quirks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're lucky characters to even be involved
in this business.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sad that he passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a lot of stories left to tell
from Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a lot of questions left to be
answered from Neville, and we can't get
[SPEAKER_05]: those answers now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he has a son that was also
interested in breeding, and I expect to
[SPEAKER_05]: see a resurgence from him at some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how heavily involved he got
with his dad's stuff or how much more he
[SPEAKER_05]: knew than anyone else about his dad's
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, I hope if he does pop up,
he carries on the legacy even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seems as though a lot of people
in magazines, articles have been quick to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of say that, you know, Hayes was his
big contribution, and undeniably he
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like there are some other lines
that are really in contention for his
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, we've been talking about NL
Hayes for a while now, and I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more his than what just pure Hayes
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about him being labelled
as like, you know, Hayes was his
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Hayes wasn't really his
contribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: The NL5 Hayes was his actual work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it may be even more important
than the Hayes by itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, he couldn't have made it without
the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as bringing forward potency in
modern lines, NL5 Hayes was absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: integral.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the most grown line in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go back and look at all the high
times issues from the 90s, all you'll see
[SPEAKER_05]: from your submissions is NL5 Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That the super skunk, ultra skunk,
I believe was the original name for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of stuff, the Afghan T work,
which may or may not be Afghani 1.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it was Maple Leaf Indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that may be because Sam's Afghani 1.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Sam's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And him and Sam were ultimate enemies,
you know, in everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did have some interaction early on,
but you know, they became very hate-filled
[SPEAKER_05]: for each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that drove a lot of their
brilliance and a lot of their madness,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, undeniably, it was inevitable we
were going to get to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you feel about our buddy Dave
Watson's acquisition of the fireloss
[SPEAKER_00]: shares and the coinciding announcement of
their breeding program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave Watson's another very interesting
character.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can't talk about Dave
without talking about Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no one in this world I respect
more when it comes to breeding than Rob
[SPEAKER_05]: Clark.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's done more for advancing the breeding
of this plant, whether through science and
[SPEAKER_05]: through education.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's done more than Rob Clark with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam is an amazing breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a brilliant dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, no denying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was some of the first doing male
reverse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some early on doing reversals.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much that he's offered this
community, and he is an often vilified
[SPEAKER_05]: figure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not for no reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for no reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think his attitude and how he interacts
with people drives a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lot of debate on whether there
was cohesion with the DEA, whether that
[SPEAKER_05]: was true or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot of physical paper proof.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I was working with Neville,
Neville said, yeah, he was known as Uncle
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam because he walked around with this
goddamn DEA agent, and everybody knew that
[SPEAKER_05]: dude, the DEA agent.
[SPEAKER_05]: But whether he ratted on people or not,
there's no real paper proof of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't like to call someone a rat
unless it's on paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's classless.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, Sam has always been about
personal gain with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of people don't feel good
about that, especially when it leads to
[SPEAKER_05]: corporatocracy, bringing in these
corporate assholes like GW Pharma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rob and Sam were integral in GW Pharma
and cannabis and their work with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know how much they still have to
do with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first mentions of Philos we can find
online are from Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam was on ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have the quotes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have the screenshots.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have all that stuff of Sam
mentioning Philos, asking people to send
[SPEAKER_05]: in their seeds that won't pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: These old seeds that you have in your,
just send them in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just send in these seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're not worth anything to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just send them into us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people didn't know about
tissue culture popping.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't know about genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't know about CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know about any of this stuff,
and they don't see the value in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I almost sent stuff into them because
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really glad I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of really special stuff was
submitted to Philos based on Rob and Sam's
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the whole Philos fall down has been
kind of interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been saying for a long time,
I've been one of the loudest people
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting against Philos for years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was when I first started really
understanding who they were, what they
[SPEAKER_05]: were about, that they were doing these
weird, shady things like vouching for
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves by using a shell company called
Open Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got a lot of backlash from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kept getting called conspiracy theorist,
tinfoil hat Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that isn't a good way to feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And being the only person standing up with
a big platform, standing up against a
[SPEAKER_05]: multi-billion dollar corporation,
that's not fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a position I even wanted to be
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought a lot of nights about it
before I said anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is some good feelings coming from
the fact that everybody is finally fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to wake up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all it took was a few years of
collecting what Philos themselves said and
[SPEAKER_05]: went on the record as saying, and using
that and showing them a mirror of
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves and putting their words back
out there in a cohesive form that people
[SPEAKER_05]: can understand and look at and say,
they are obviously contradicting
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They used underhanded and non-transparent
means to get the genetics that they have
[SPEAKER_05]: and the data they have for the purpose of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the presentation that was circulated
from 2015 clearly shows that Philos had
[SPEAKER_05]: the direction and goal of ultimately
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now they're trying to say it was
a new idea that they had and they're just
[SPEAKER_05]: getting into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were presenting investors with a
presentation saying that that was their
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimate goal even back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: How Rob and Sam, well, we know Rob is on
the chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a chairman on the board of Philos.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: How Sam and GW Pharma are ultimately tied
in, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Philos is working with a company called GW
Industries, also known as Groundworks
[SPEAKER_05]: Industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no clear tie yet to GW Pharma,
but I'm going to find that fucking tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's one to be found, I'm going to
find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Proof Cultivar that also goes
under the name of GW Industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Jeremy Plum who started Open
Cannabis Project with Mowgli Homes,
[SPEAKER_05]: also involved with the Cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cultivation Classics, being a partner of
Philos, and all this being this weird
[SPEAKER_05]: incestuous circle of corporations and
shell companies, all for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_05]: deceiving people and getting said data to
sell as a whole to Scots.
[SPEAKER_05]: They often say that they're open source,
but they don't have an open source
[SPEAKER_05]: license, so they're not open source.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you ask them about it, they'll say
that they're working on getting their
[SPEAKER_05]: license to be open source.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in their rebuttal to this whole thing,
they keep saying using the word open
[SPEAKER_05]: source to try to trick people into
believing that they're open with the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody can see the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't published a data set in two
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: During those two years, they've tried
selling off to Scots and Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked Paige from Philos directly,
have you ever courted Scots Monsanto to
[SPEAKER_05]: sell the data?
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, I don't know, which was one of
my favorite answers of all time,
[SPEAKER_05]: because Scots has heavy NDAs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she couldn't quite say yes,
because they have nondisclosure
[SPEAKER_05]: agreements.
[SPEAKER_05]: She couldn't say no, because she's too
stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe they've already been caught in
so many lies she didn't want to get caught
[SPEAKER_05]: in another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems to me like if nothing
else, it's just the way they've handled
[SPEAKER_00]: the situation has been quite problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even if like, let's just let's
just play devil's advocate and say that
[SPEAKER_00]: they did have best intentions and it was a
recent idea and it wasn't very well
[SPEAKER_00]: thought out and all of these things,
which don't necessarily seem true,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's just say they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like it's still been like a PR
nightmare 101 on their part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it just seems to back, you know,
give credence to the idea that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, it is what they're trying to deny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's it's blatant.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are losing focus on the
idea that they are, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_05]: stealing fucking genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't steal anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was handed to them, but it was handed
to them under a false pretense.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem was the lies, the lack of
transparency.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, they called me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They outright called me a liar and a
conspiracy theorist when I brought up
[SPEAKER_05]: their breeding program and their tissue
culture lab six months ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: They called me a conspiracy theorist and
said that that tissue culture lab didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: exist after they made a press release in a
business publication about the tissue
[SPEAKER_05]: culture lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're talking out both sides of their
mouth and they really think that our
[SPEAKER_05]: community is so stupid and so stoned,
we're not going to catch on to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that that really shows how they look
at us and that they are not part of our
[SPEAKER_05]: community and they clearly don't
understand what we're about and who we
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, however, have some questions myself
around the actual applicability of this
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, having a bit of a
molecular biology background, I can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of understand a lot of the technology
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still don't understand how they plan
to use this data set to help them breed
[SPEAKER_00]: better, because it seems like it's still a
bit fanciful in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, unless they're planning on
doing some actual, like, Casp9 CRISPR
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like that would take a long
time to develop, you know, the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: primers they need to change certain loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it just seems like it's so ill
thought out, but maybe I'm just retarded.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think it's misdirection.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's clearly misdirection.
[SPEAKER_05]: They intend to sell the data, which is why
it's not up there to view publicly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they intend to breed shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll do some CBD work and lame
attempts at putting markers in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is that they have short
read data.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they're having a problem
selling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why Scott's Monsanto didn't buy it,
because it's short read data.
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked with Kevin McKernan from
Medicinal Genomics, and as a disclaimer,
[SPEAKER_05]: they are a direct competitor of Phylos.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, he's going to say certain
things that cast a negative light on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to say he's been very fair in
this whole debacle with Phylos in
[SPEAKER_05]: explaining the science behind it and the
fact that they're using short read data,
[SPEAKER_05]: so their data sets are incomplete.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason why they're still
confused why the Forum Cut of Cookies and
[SPEAKER_05]: OGKB are showing up as the same exact
clone when they clearly are not.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still thinking all the OG kushes
are S1s of each other, even hybrids,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they come back as being the same
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because their data sets aren't
complete, and without complete data sets,
[SPEAKER_05]: with incorrect data sets, they're not
going to be able to do the breeding that
[SPEAKER_05]: they want to do, and I think they know
that now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all this breeding stuff is
misdirection from what they're really
[SPEAKER_05]: doing, which is trying to sell everyone's
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do you feel about molecular farms
being granted the rather broad sweeping
[SPEAKER_00]: utility patents last year, which,
you know, there was an analysis done,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't remember the author's name,
but they basically said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I've got my things correct here,
seems as if at any point if they wanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could pull the plug on the entire
cannabis industry in terms of like these
[SPEAKER_00]: utility patents seemingly cover all
cannabis that currently exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they are very broad sweeping,
and the problem with patents once they're
[SPEAKER_05]: granted, it takes an act of God and a lot
of money to fight them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a lot of money to fight them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, cannabis, it's always been in
the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: The black market's always existed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them try to sue us when the fucking
black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them figure it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we'll go under a thousand
different fucking names so they have no
[SPEAKER_05]: idea who to sue.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we'll do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They fight legally.
[SPEAKER_05]: We fight real, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they can try to use their bullshit,
but it's not going to work and not be
[SPEAKER_05]: affecting the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: The legal market has already shown in many
cases, whether it's Bedrikan in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_05]: or the, I can't remember the name of the
one in Israel, they want a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is going to be a monopoly where
people have to buy from one certain source
[SPEAKER_05]: to get their weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They may make it look like it's not a
monopoly by having a bunch of shell
[SPEAKER_05]: companies and shell corporations under
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's going to be one owner doing
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way it's going and that's the
way it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to fight back the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, do you think that there might be a
certain event or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of something specific to happen
before they do, you know, bring everything
[SPEAKER_00]: online and just try to pull the plug on
everyone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're waiting for federal
legalisation at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be through people like
when I was going through Proof Cultivar
[SPEAKER_05]: and all their employees, they have their
own lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have literally, it shows on their
page, a multi-billion dollar fluid
[SPEAKER_05]: finances.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they're able to afford these lobbyists
pushing through bills when they want to be
[SPEAKER_05]: pushed through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're behind a lot of anti-home
grower bills.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think once people realise that these
big companies, Proof, fucking GW
[SPEAKER_05]: Industries, whoever the fuck they really
are, Philos, all these people are behind
[SPEAKER_05]: these anti-home growing bills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once people realise that, then it's going
to get real disgusting because you're
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking with people's livelihoods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these aren't people that go to
lawyers.
[SPEAKER_05]: These aren't people that use lawyers to
settle shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to run into a few scary
places for their personal protection,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not me saying I'm going to do
anything, but it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not made to work in a quasi-legal
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're soft.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're daddy's money boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gang gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, ultimately, how do you feel
about the idea of technology assisted or
[SPEAKER_00]: like entirely facilitated breeding
programs would work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's inevitable that we'll
reach a point where like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: tech assisted breeding just supersedes
like using first principles and just us,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, picking what we think is good?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where you'll hear the hippie side
of me come out, which there is very little
[SPEAKER_05]: that exists in my punk rock soul.
[SPEAKER_05]: But God damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I truly believe that plants are sentient
beings and this robo breeding shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the best quote I ever heard was
from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need your machine to tell me what
my plant is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoke my butt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow my butt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the phenotypes at hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need your machine to tell me how
to breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing this long before it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole machine breeding is it's
gonna have a place in it, but I think it
[SPEAKER_05]: loses a lot of the soul, a lot of the art
behind it, a lot of the art and the soul
[SPEAKER_05]: behind it that loses a lot of the love
between the plant and the grower,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I don't care what anyone says,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I'm depressed, my plants are
depressed and it's not just because of
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe I'm not watering as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm not paying as much attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: They feel it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They interact with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's gonna lose all that if it all
goes to that kind of breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has its place in certain medical
applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's cool to work in tandem with
it, but never lose the soul.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never lose the soul in the art and
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, yeah, there's a lot of
evidence to suggest that they definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with us, if not just being
stimulated by our voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of change things up,
get a little more lighthearted,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to jump back to some older strains
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: One I've been thinking about for a while
that I think you probably have some
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with, Callie Mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to hear about it a lot and then it
just kind of fell off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think happened there?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Callie Mist, I believe Simon himself,
I don't want to misquote him because I've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen people misquote him and he gets super
pissed, but he had lost some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: original parents to Callie Mist in a bust
back in the older days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since then, it hasn't been able to be
recreated the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I do have an old pack of original
Callie Mist here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been kind of waiting to pop them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself, I don't have the desire to really
go down the Callie Mist route.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of hoping that someone comes
along that has that major desire and the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability to do that and puts these seeds to
good use and brings it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have so many other projects that I
haven't focused on it, but those seeds are
[SPEAKER_05]: there and they're well stored for any real
breeder with skin in the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't be hitting me up, fucking noobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be hitting me up for my Callie Mist.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only going to go to special people
that I know that really have skin in the
[SPEAKER_05]: game that have a want and desire to bring
this line back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, from all of my observations,
it seems like the largest component of
[SPEAKER_00]: good breeding or a good breeding program,
at least, is having like really good P1
[SPEAKER_00]: parental stock on top of good selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for everyone living outside of
the US, it can be hard to find truly
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal clones to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're forced to deal with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with so many of us in that situation,
should we just constantly be buying seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking them, trying to find better
parents and breed with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or should we focus on creating strains in
terms of like, just trying to make an
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring that's better than the parents,
if you get what I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think maybe not constantly be
buying seeds because I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_05]: a constant supply of good parentage out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a finite supply,
yet there is a lot of seeds out there to
[SPEAKER_05]: buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a finite supply of good parent
stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be mindful of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go back and learn a lot of these
baselines.
[SPEAKER_05]: These baselines, you can still buy from
certain Dutch companies that, and they may
[SPEAKER_05]: not be the best versions of what they once
were, but you can still find those old
[SPEAKER_05]: phenos in those lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great place to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clones are what they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the clone onlys, they're great.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a high demand of them in the US
because there's hype behind certain ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them have created their own hype
and are as good as they say they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, all of these started with a seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything starts with a seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think things can be created absolutely
magical in any land that you're at,
[SPEAKER_05]: as long as you have good parent stock and
seed stock to work from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, how do you feel outdoor bud
compared to indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I ask this is because,
you know, I love outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe I should say I love the idea
of outdoor, but the reality is I just
[SPEAKER_00]: still haven't found any outdoor bud that
makes me feel like this is better than
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it needs to be... There are
certain lines that want to be run outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: as opposed to indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being the old Colombians, the old Thai,
stuff like that, they really truly express
[SPEAKER_05]: better outdoor than indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like modern lines, it's rare that
you'll find something grown outdoor,
[SPEAKER_05]: organically, and all that, that really
does compare to what you can get in a room
[SPEAKER_05]: that's built for that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that said, I mean, some of these
old Thais, the old Colombians,
[SPEAKER_05]: they only do well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of lines that I have that I
don't run, that I keep, old heirloom and
[SPEAKER_05]: land race lines, because I don't have an
outdoor space and I don't want to do them
[SPEAKER_05]: in the disservice of trying to grow them
indoor and not getting their full,
[SPEAKER_05]: the full range of phenotypes and
expressions because they were always grown
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoor and never acclimated for indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, what's the most
medicinal strain for you personally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what kind of cures things the best
for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: My riotberry line helped with my
depression.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's from its Thai expressions
in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It helped.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a tooth abscess for like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing was helping.
[SPEAKER_05]: No narcotic pills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing was fucking helping.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was excruciating pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that riotberry, the second that I
tried that, even though recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: potency, it was minimal, minimal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it helped with that pain, that nerve
pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when I found that special
medical part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one I've got a lot of questions
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to talk about it,
I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I've a lot of people in the
cannabis community, I don't want to say a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot, but, you know, there's a substantial
minority who come to cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dealing with addictions in one
form or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they view this as a gateway
to a better life.
[SPEAKER_00]: How has cannabis been involved in your
life in regards to addiction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do you view it as like a tool to
help overcome that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would be your message for people
who maybe are looking to use cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: means to help fight whatever kind of demon
they're battling?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in our community, there is a lot
of shaming of people that use or have used
[SPEAKER_05]: other drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from the era I came from, usually if
you were dealing weed, you were dealing
[SPEAKER_05]: other shit too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in dealing other shit, you usually got
involved in other shit for personal use or
[SPEAKER_05]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been pretty open about my use of
opiates and my, you know, my past with
[SPEAKER_05]: heroin, my past with fentanyl,
my past with all kinds of narcotics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went on the whole gamut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a part of our punk rock scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, a lot of my best friends
have died because of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis took me in a whole new direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me a lot of hope that I didn't
have.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me a way to kind of realize that I
had value in this world, that I had
[SPEAKER_05]: something to offer this world,
you know, aside from just playing punk
[SPEAKER_05]: rock music and being fucked up and just
doing fucked up shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, every day, there isn't a
day that goes by that some of the people
[SPEAKER_05]: who don't like me don't call me a fucking
junkie.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do it to be hurtful, but at the same
time, it shows their ignorance and it
[SPEAKER_05]: shows their ability to understand that
most of the old school dealt with this at
[SPEAKER_05]: some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the old breeders around were at
one time dealing with opiate abuse.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was just a part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish people would stop the shaming
because, I mean, whether people want to
[SPEAKER_05]: admit it or not, cannabis is a drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: It affects your central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get high from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a drug for all intents and
purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you're using it for escaping
reality or not or using it medically,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what you can deal with yourself
looking at yourself in the mirror and be
[SPEAKER_05]: happy with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to be outspoken about the harm
reduction using cannabis as opposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: getting off of opiates using cannabis to
do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to be open about it and talk about
it only because every time I do,
[SPEAKER_05]: I get messages from 20, 30 people thanking
me saying, you know, I'm dealing with this
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm scared to even talk about it out
in the open because I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_05]: called a junkie like you get called a
junkie.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it helps them, then that's all that I
give a fuck about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about the people who call me
a junkie.
[SPEAKER_05]: They obviously don't know me, but it's a
hard stance to take in this community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lately, I've been seeing other breeders,
family members of breeders come out and
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about their struggles with addiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me so fucking proud to see it
because it's not an easy stance to take.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are very, very judgmental in this
community and you'd think this would be
[SPEAKER_05]: the most accepting community for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really wonderful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of jump back to some of
your work you're currently doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally forgot to ask you about this
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum banana line, you mentioned it
at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's obviously a very popular
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have future plans to work it out
further?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get my mail back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, before the whole moon situation,
I stored my mail with Cecil and Why Yeast
[SPEAKER_05]: Farms has my mail as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully I can get that back and
continue to work the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very special in breeding dog
against dominant traits like the deep
[SPEAKER_05]: chunk is notorious for being a really hard
plant to breed with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always, always, always dominates
everything that it touches.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the platinum banana is one of those
lines where it allowed the best traits of
[SPEAKER_05]: the deep chunk to come through,
which is the resin production,
[SPEAKER_05]: its density, and its overall look,
that beauty of the blackness that it has.
[SPEAKER_05]: But its turps aren't that great and the
potency, it's okay, but it's not the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And platinum banana allowed the best
traits to come through and I'm really
[SPEAKER_05]: proud of that line, the chunky monkey
line, as well as when I crossed it to the
[SPEAKER_05]: highland tie, it allowed the best traits
of the highland tie to come through,
[SPEAKER_05]: the juicy fruit tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And kept with some of the banana traits,
kept that banana turp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when people want banana OG,
it's usually because they're searching for
[SPEAKER_05]: banana turps, not because they want OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find OG anywhere, but that banana
turp is very special and it brings that to
[SPEAKER_05]: every line it touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certainly on the lookout for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to jump to another hybrid,
another mail you've been using recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been working with the Skittles cube
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to know, what was it
specifically about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe for example, it was the
structure or like the nose or like
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it about you that drew you
towards that one and what's your plans
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any plans going forward with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I found in the Z cube line,
the mail and how it bred was that it
[SPEAKER_05]: actually was nothing like the Skittles
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what really drew me to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not too enthused about the Skittles
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a friend that pushed me to pop a
bunch of the Skittles stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was saying it's hype, you know,
it's got the best shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what people want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't enthused about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also I tried to remember, you know,
I have my own views on stuff and maybe I
[SPEAKER_05]: need to open up, you know, and look at way
other people view shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they know better than me in modern
age with modern strains because I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: pay a lot of attention to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, what I found, I loved in
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found an old Hindu Kush type plant that
was fucking rank, absolutely rank,
[SPEAKER_05]: not fruity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does breed some fruity traits in
certain lines, but they're recessive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't see it as often.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I loved everything it brought to all
the lines that I crossed with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just taking it back to a throwback
Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought that was fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that said, it's not very
Skittlesy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not what people expect from Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is that, but I try to make that
super clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's a really interesting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've got a friend who's about to pop
the same pack, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me, he said, Oh, do you think
I'll find like, Hindu Kush Finos?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, is that the Mao they
used initially?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I mean, if it's a
BX3, you probably shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, if they've done their job,
you probably shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: If they've done their job, like in a BX3.
[SPEAKER_05]: So back crossing is perfect for
stabilizing a single trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of people, because of
Brothers Grimm specifically with their
[SPEAKER_05]: work with C99, telling people that it
makes a pure representation of a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spreading forward is the way to lock in
several, several traits at once.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back crossing locks in a single trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking that to the BX3, it was very
uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say that, but it was so uniform and,
and, and nothing like Skittles that they'd
[SPEAKER_05]: missed the mark like a motherfucker with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I see that in a lot of back crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think people understand the
purpose of back crossing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think because of Brothers Grimm
saying that, you know, yeah, this is how
[SPEAKER_05]: you back cross and get a perfect
representation.
[SPEAKER_05]: of the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause technically it's, you know,
88% of the genetics, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_05]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not how it really works though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's for stabilizing a single trait
and not multiple traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say that in structure and appearance,
but it was nothing like Skittles at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, I've seen many people pop
Z-Cube and get completely different,
[SPEAKER_05]: but uniform things from that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know that that line was really
what they said it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that they didn't take that
line, whatever seeds they had and throw it
[SPEAKER_05]: into several different lines with
different names.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I saw when popping a big wide
swath of the dying breed stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Shiloh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I think Brandon was a kind of
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clown shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite thing that's ever come
out of the cannabis community of the clown
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes one dude, just that one video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would die a happy man having been
involved with the cannabis community and
[SPEAKER_00]: just seeing that video, like fuck it's
brilliant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's saved on my phone forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've kept it forever because it's fucking
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that dude's a wing nut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shiloh is, is, is an interesting dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's likable, but I don't think that he
was as involved with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_05]: projects as maybe he should be because
people have all kinds of stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you pop, you know, 12 different
strains from a company, there's supposed
[SPEAKER_05]: to be 12 different things and they all
look identical.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: They stuffed the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They bait and switched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to let my buddy know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to jump on to something we spoke
about earlier, when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how, you know, different land races
perform better outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost like, you know,
a bit of an injustice to do them indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some land race lines that you
would really love to see pop their heads
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not necessarily that you think
will, because like, you know, someone's
[SPEAKER_00]: got the seeds or whatever, but you would
just be really stoked if they did happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see the lines that I selected
of Colombian black to pop up that Gage
[SPEAKER_05]: Green used and claimed as his own.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see that pop back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that said, that was from
Brazilian Seedco, who is a well-known
[SPEAKER_05]: scammer.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of kind of our circles friends went
over to his operation and saw how he was
[SPEAKER_05]: running it and that it was all
cross-contamination, cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_05]: So calling that line Colombian black may
not be a truism, you know, but it was what
[SPEAKER_05]: he called the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that specific line was really special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people used it over the
years, but I'd like to see it come back
[SPEAKER_05]: pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Gage released it in something he
called a bastard series, which was
[SPEAKER_05]: probably because I selected it and he just
wanted to fucking throw shade,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, but it was special, but it was a
long 23 week, 26 week line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I actually had some of those seeds
before my seed collection a few years back
[SPEAKER_00]: got stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you haven't really been in the
community for very long if you haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: it happen to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's for sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll happen at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the boxes that you're
looking for, like a strain or a clone to
[SPEAKER_00]: tick before you bring it into the library?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you regularly looking to bring new
things into the library or are you just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of waiting for something special to
more so present itself?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I go off, I don't really go
hunting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't trade a lot with people.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, I brought a lot in after
the moon incident, but I don't do a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: trading, which is funny because I,
you know, I've been accused of stealing
[SPEAKER_05]: clones from people's rooms and shit and
I'm a hermit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't go into other people's rooms and I
don't trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like trading.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a big thing that I do because of
certain things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I look for bringing something in,
it's usually because someone I really
[SPEAKER_05]: respect and trust tells me this shit is
fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of my friends know that personally,
like for my smoke, I can't smoke Afghani
[SPEAKER_05]: based stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me paranoid and depressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they tell me it's something that's
really special on a spectrum of something
[SPEAKER_05]: that I can smoke and enjoy, that's
something that interests me, especially if
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect that person and know that they
really know good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onto our last questions before the quick
fire ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It incorporates your favourite person,
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a buddy of everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people say that certain parents
contribute certain traits to offsprings,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and Sub says that the male is
what imparts the potency and the female is
[SPEAKER_00]: more like the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever found anything like yourself
or do you just find it's a mix of random
[SPEAKER_00]: traits expressed from each parent and
there's no like hard fast rule of thumb?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely no hard fast rule of
thumb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Science tells us that different traits
align differently with different parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no, that is such an odd blanket
statement and tells me he has no fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: clue what he's talking about when it comes
to breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is a case by case basis,
not just strain by strain, but pheno by
[SPEAKER_05]: pheno, how those traits will, NLLs will
align with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's no way to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, I remember Neville saying
specifically with Hayes that he did not
[SPEAKER_05]: like how the female Hayes bred,
but he liked how the male Hayes is bred,
[SPEAKER_05]: that it imparted the best traits of Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with someone like that, that worked so
extensively with the Hayes, I would
[SPEAKER_05]: probably listen to him in that fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that said, it's a case by case
and parent by parent basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really have to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: In science, things don't line up
necessarily all the time the same ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's a retard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onto our last questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to have a little thing where it's
like the views expressed on the show are
[SPEAKER_00]: not exactly that of my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto our last set of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, I want to run some
similar ones by what we wrapped up with
[SPEAKER_00]: last time to see if your point of view has
changed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one, what is your favourite
strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be the Bubba Sativa, my Clockwork
Orange and Riot Berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't remember what I said last time,
but that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, East Coast Sour Diesel Strawberry
Cream from CBF.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the best male I've ever found from
anything for being true breeding and
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding amazing traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time you said Riot Berry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's always going to be tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you even mentioned Bubba
Sativa in the mix as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the worst strain in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_05]: Buckeye Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shots fired.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, there are a few people that would be
a lot less respected if C-Depot,
[SPEAKER_05]: the old forum was still around,
but they scammed a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_05]: so they shut their forum down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are a few people from that forum
that have made some really bold claims
[SPEAKER_05]: lately, whether they're saying that Urkel
is from their family or they're saying
[SPEAKER_05]: they created Buckeye Purple out of old
Northern Lights genetics that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, this and that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mel Van, she's started not that many years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was during the C-Depot days.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all saw her first grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw her bragging about buying Bode's
recently released NL5 line, and we saw the
[SPEAKER_05]: trash that she was putting out there known
as Buckeye Purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's garb.
[SPEAKER_05]: People probably hadn't been as
knowledgeable about Chitrali and its
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful magenta traits and stuff that it
throws and that it dries pretty brown for
[SPEAKER_05]: the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like hay, and they look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks pretty in magenta, and that's new
to them, so they go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have rarely met anyone that goes,
damn, that's some dank shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's actually smoked it and run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's a valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bit of a new one, but I love
asking all of our new guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite food?
[SPEAKER_05]: Favorite food?
[SPEAKER_05]: Choco Tacos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Choco Tacos.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was that shit at Disneyland?
[SPEAKER_05]: The pineapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember what it's fucking called
off the top of my head, but it's at the
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiki Room.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get these pineapple things,
iced pineapple things that are delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I wouldn't know, but you got my
mouth watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Choco Tacos and bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like bread a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: White, sourdough, whole grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we talking?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like yeast rolls that are kind of sweet
and Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hawaiian rolls that are sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet Hawaiian rolls are the fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't they, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can eat, like I literally eat that all
the time, all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stay fully stocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll definitely leave that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on a desert island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only take two strains with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to cultivate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just somehow got an endless supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to?
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were going to cultivate them,
it would be NL5 and Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I know how much variance
comes from NL5, Haze and how much amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: shit has resulted from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I only had it to smoke Riot Bari and
Bubba Sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe, maybe Silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Silver Pearl in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty, a pretty big fan of the Silver
Pearl cut Pips has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's one that doesn't get a lot of,
you know, good publicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always thought maybe it was because
like early Pearl was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more of like that cash crop of variety and
obviously it used Silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the real Silver Pearl like?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go and look at his feed,
I suggest that anybody who listens to this
[SPEAKER_05]: goes and checks out the at sign Pipsweed
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got beautiful pictures up of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very photogenic, like any modern
variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy resin production.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not narcotic potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very clear headed quality Sativa
type high on an indica frame.
[SPEAKER_05]: What people would normally associate with
a Sativa type high.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find that high in Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily a Sativa type high,
but it's what people would normally
[SPEAKER_05]: associate with Sativas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I fucking love that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus my girlfriend has Lupus and it treats
the nausea from Lupus for her insanely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing treats it better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that's, that's, it's a special
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we all need to keep an eye out
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a Kung Fu grip on it though.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, ain't nobody getting it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, final question for our interview
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is one strain where if you could go
back in time and get it, you would,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one you would pick to go back and kind
of save from being lost to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve Murphy's Afghani or the Afghan tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to fill us in a
little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More on what they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Steve Murphy's Afghani is the basis for
all Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern Lights one through 12,
I believe we're all based on the Steve
[SPEAKER_05]: Murphy Afghani line, each with different
parents combined in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Afghan tea is what Neville said was the
basis for Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said it was from the Maple Leaf
line, but I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's an Afghani one selection and
it's responsible for all the chems,
[SPEAKER_05]: all the sours, all the OGs.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that special, special plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's why I would choose
those two specific lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's chocolate tie and other
lines I'd love to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I had to go back and rescue two
strains, it would be those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fantastic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good one, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, with that being said, did you have any
comments or shout outs you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to all the people who helped me
after the moon debacle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt Elite from Elite Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my best friends on Earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Red for going and getting my seats
back from Moon because I was no longer in
[SPEAKER_05]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been a good friend to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Surfweed for taking beautiful shots of the
banana tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of our our Canna Luminati crew,
the Pree Pree, all the guys that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, Denali.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I shouldn't name them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all those guys, they know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: CSI Humboldt and Bodhi, of course,
for being fucking amazing friends and just
[SPEAKER_05]: being good mentors, both of them,
and being good human beings.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's so many more people I
could shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, those are the ones that are
constantly closest to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: My buddy, Resin Long, who right now is
taking a hiatus from life and kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of my best friends on Earth,
and I hope I see his smiling face again
[SPEAKER_05]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds like a wonderful
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we all see him back soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, with that being said, thank you so
