[SPEAKER_01]: Here to talk all things Lucky Dog Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: along with the newest venture he's a part

[SPEAKER_01]: genetic repository.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some big aspirations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty gang, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: On today, we are thrilled to have a
longtime friend, a prolific grower and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder, the man behind Lucky Dog Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: and a part of the newest venture I'm sure
you've heard of, The Grateful Head.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big welcome to Skunk BA for taking the
time to join us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm well, how are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm well, I'm well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to know, what have you
been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lately, I've been smoking a lot of live
rosin, decarboxylated in my pens that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been smoking Jack's Cleaner of all
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really ugly flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's not pretty at all,
but it makes incredible, incredible live
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put some on the toaster oven and you
know, I was trying to find some devices
[SPEAKER_02]: for the live rosin pens that we sell here
at Lucky Dog Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I chose, I took like 40,
I took like 40 grams of the live rosin I
[SPEAKER_02]: made and melted it in the toaster oven and
put it in the pens to kind of test out the
[SPEAKER_02]: devices and you know, passing them out to
the employees and my friends and smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: them myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just tastes so damn good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have to, I did have to keep it in
there a little bit longer to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: mellow out the extra energy side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little woo, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of got a little bit of that to
come out of it when I just kind of left it
[SPEAKER_02]: in there for a little bit longer,
decarboxyl just a bit longer, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so that's what I've been
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the flower front, I've been
smoking a lot of sour band.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've been, we had a nice crop of
that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually been smoking a lot of Jack
Herrera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone joints to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like my morning time thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go out in the sunshine, get about 15
minutes on my face and smoke a little Jack
[SPEAKER_02]: Herrera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then usually at night, it's something
like deserty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have like a deserty thing at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then another one that we're gonna,
that we have over here that I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: loving is called Triple Burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk Master Flex, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone passed me a cut of it up here
and some live rosin of it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have been dabbing that and
it's fucking, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really enjoying that savory flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear it's got some sort of chem in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I don't really know the lineage
of it, but it definitely tastes like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say chem D in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's got that savory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you nailed it with the chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, it's, it's nice though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be rocking that one here
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool to hear you've been getting
into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to ask you some more, like,
are there any other sort of standout
[SPEAKER_01]: strains you've put into the pens?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you referenced with the Jack's
cleaner, like was it that it was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit racy in the way like sativas were?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say you were trying to mellow it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't hear about people say,
Oh, you put anything into a pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels like an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sounds like you were getting more
of that sativa expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my first time decarboxylating the
live rosin myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, at first I just let it
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to get every little itty
bitty bubble out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I let it go for like probably
way too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so it kind of just naturally
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did have some of the, the rosin that
wasn't decarboxylating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did a dab and I was like,
that's a different feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was way more racier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't too much, but like I said,
you know, I don't, I don't smoke that in
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pen is kind of throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were saying you mostly use the pens
through the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know, have you ventured much
into the world of like hash, dry sieve,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sticking mostly to like the more
concentrate-esque?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we have been making, we've been
setting aside a little bubble hash one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make the, I make all the live rosin
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't have anyone else to do it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But so, yeah, I always set a little bubble
aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love having a freeze dryer, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a new thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I wish I would have had that
all along.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing to come back the very next
day and like pull out some dry hash bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: hash and, you know, melt it up,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've been keeping, I've been
doing some tits, some purple fool stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some red dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one came out really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a big yielder, so it's probably
not going to be something in the rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of ours, the lucky dog crosses
that we made.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tests around 29% THC, whatever that
means to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's got this beautiful flavor to it,
like this almost like green weed flavor to
[SPEAKER_02]: it that's kind of rare these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got this incredible like relaxing
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who come in, it's been really
popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like our last drop, the ones that were
flowering out here have been really
[SPEAKER_02]: popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our most popular is diesel poison and red
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't, we can't grow enough of that all
of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're kind of surpassing all the
boutiques and the old chems that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, some of my old classics
that I've got, which makes me so happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that, you know, people that don't
know anything about lucky dog or really
[SPEAKER_02]: even chem dog or like any of the stuff
that goes into the history or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll come in and they'll buy stuff that
we've selected from our own and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, crosses and it just really
validates what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's like, there's just no bias
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, you know, preconceived notions
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just simply, you know, this is the
one I like and they, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they asked for it and they're bummed out
we don't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made, I did a little bit of that,
some red dog, except purple full stack and
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some pull dog there, the skunk dog
cross and the tits GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, always makes some really
nice fucking rising or bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about, that's all I can think
of right off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really not that much, but oh,
and we have one called dog roller that we
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's in, is also in rising form too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a heavy duty strong Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you're telling yourself short.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, that's, that's not that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, there's a plethora of killers
in that mix there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you've got some good
concentrates on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I want to ask, given you're trying
all different variety, if you had to pick
[SPEAKER_01]: one as your favorite, which would you go
with currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of the ones I've made that I currently
have, I'd say probably the tits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been my favorite ever since I
smoked it as far as concentrates goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's good anytime of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally I smoke it in the daytime,
but you know, it's, it's, it's just got
[SPEAKER_02]: that, it's got the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It coats it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just stays with you, makes your mouth
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just got the nice high,
you know, it's a really rare plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got it all, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say the tits, that always is going,
I'm going back to, I got one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: Puffco the pipes, what do you call them?
[SPEAKER_02]: The proxies, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, if I'm feeling saucy,
you know, we have to worry about
[SPEAKER_02]: inspectors here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't just walk around with those
pipes in our hands around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a legal cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why the pens come in handy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know, it's not something
that we prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something that we kind of,
it's a waste to a means, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do like, I do like smoking the tits
rosin out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really get a good flavor,
the full flavor comes through with no
[SPEAKER_02]: water in it and such, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and just to loop back, you were
mentioning with the flower, you were
[SPEAKER_01]: having Jack Herrera and some sour band.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're starting to
gravitate more to the sativa end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, or is it just in the daytime?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I am actually, you know, as I've
gotten older, it's, it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it's because I wasn't so
exposed to it when I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, twenties and thirties,
just too much chem around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that I don't have sativa
qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know it does, but, but some of
these I just didn't have access to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I would have enjoyed them back
then, but yeah, I do gravitate towards
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that uppity feeling, you know,
the older I've gotten, I'm 51 now and I
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That energized feeling, it, it does me
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like that brain stimulation,
you know, you know, kind of creativity,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, problem solving kind of effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to see things
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when weed does that to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get that a lot from the sativas I
smoke and I do like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been breeding a lot more sativas too,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to be my next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, like the pole dog,
for instance, that's definitely,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the diesel poison,
the diesel poison has just been like a big
[SPEAKER_02]: surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we just packed, we, we took one pack,
13 seeds, germinated them, grew them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have kept three of them,
but that was one that just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the problem with breeding with
anything that's high in terpenaline is of
[SPEAKER_02]: course, I think we've talked about this
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dominates everything, you know,
you know, a lot of people, that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: weed smells like, cause that's all they
remember when they, from the times they
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled weed, you know, but so when you're
able to make a cross, cause it's a great,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a great flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does like, it does a lot of things to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I can't even explain it,
but to be able to have that in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a strain in the flavor, in the aroma,
but not dominating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can have like, you know,
different smells, different flavors on the
[SPEAKER_02]: back end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what this does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, you know, we, we pulled
that one off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge yielder, you know,
it just wrecks you.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would say that's, you know,
that's one of the ones that I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also did the pull dog with the
skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely has to tee the leaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the skunk dog itself is just by
itself is, it's got almost medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits when it comes to things like
ADHD, you know, it's so focusing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I've had people come into the
shop here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've told you this before where,
you know, that's why they smoke her
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have severe, what they call
ADHD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, certain strains can really
lock them in and change their day when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had people give us feedback like
that on, on the pull dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and I enjoy those now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be kind of scared of those cause
I don't really want to like have a heart
[SPEAKER_02]: racing, you know, like, whew, like near a
panic attack feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nowadays, I don't know if I enjoy it
or if it's just different, but I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I've thought about that a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, there was a time where
if I had any of these sativas,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just feel profoundly anxious and
not enjoy it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my conclusion I've come to is that I
think over time, you learn to harness that
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling and use it as like, you feel
energized and productive, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas in other situations, it feels like
almost a big crippling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that's just my anecdotal sort of
musings on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have thought about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why did it used to make me anxious,
but the same clone nowadays, it's like,
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that maybe that's a good point for
me too, because, you know, maybe when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was younger, I certainly, I would say,
I don't want to say I'm busier cause I
[SPEAKER_02]: physically maybe I'm not as busy,
but mentally I'm busier than I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: been in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe it just fits better with my
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now because of that, whereas when I was
younger, I'm at home, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my bedrooms, you know, and growing
the weed, hanging out with my kid,
[SPEAKER_02]: my little kid, you know, and maybe,
maybe that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just that you need to have the
right kind of day to have that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke in your life, you know, production
wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The listeners are probably sick of hearing
me say this, but what you said about the
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel poison being like unexpectedly
popular is, is really essentially a
[SPEAKER_01]: sentiment I'm always mentioning to people,
which is that, that notion that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: burnt out on blue dream or Jack Herra or
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't think it applies outside of
California because the majority of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're just not exposed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see people in Australia all the time
growing Durban poison S1, blue dream S1,
[SPEAKER_01]: train wreck S1, because they're very much
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it mirrors what your sort
of experience is that there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are still really into
turpentine profiles and love the high and
[SPEAKER_01]: think, yeah, this is for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: California market is different than all
the others I've been exposed to and been
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a big place with a lot of
people and they do drive markets outside
[SPEAKER_02]: of their own, you know, but, but I've said
that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised when I came here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was blown away because I've never really
seen that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I came here and opened up
shop, you know, people were looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: the sativas and they still are,
you know, and so we intentionally grow
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the traditional classical
classic sativas, we grow more and more of
[SPEAKER_02]: those because that's what they want,
you know, which is it's not purple weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things can change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I call back there, it's all about
the purple weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe how cold is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it is, I think it is an outside
California thing, which is literally
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, I guess the next question is,
would you ever consider maybe developing a
[SPEAKER_01]: male that's like, you know, hybrid sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have, we, we, we selected a Kim
Fuego that seems to pass on the best parts
[SPEAKER_02]: of the sour diesel when it comes to those
effects, you know, um, we've done a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of, we just finished doing a lot of
crosses for those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to test them out, see if they
landed where we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that's, that's, that's kind of
what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uh, we definitely are developing
more males here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, slowly but surely, you know,
uh, but we're trying to expand what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know, of course we're Kim dog based
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always will be insist the way it is,
but, um, but we have, we have started to
[SPEAKER_02]: do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say, I feel pretty good about
this next line that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out with as far as the,
that Kim Fuego male that we selected,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if the Kim Fuego has been out
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the most popular one I've
ever, I've ever made as far as what I can
[SPEAKER_02]: see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so decided to kind of look into it
a little bit more, uh, been collecting
[SPEAKER_02]: clones of it, then selecting more females
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they've gone through a few males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just, we're literally drying a bunch
of flour, seeded flour right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to start testing them out
later this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start popping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've had a few friends grow some Kim
Fuego out and they've all loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'd love to know, are there any,
uh, particular crosses in the mix that you
[SPEAKER_01]: did that like, you know, you, I know that
like when I make seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like, say you make 10 crosses,
there's like, there's two in your mind
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're like, Oh, I'm really,
those are the ones I'm keen on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what are they for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, honestly, I've been through this and
I try not to do that because I disappoint
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, I did some red Lebanese hash
plant crosses and they were phenomenal,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there was a little bit higher intersex
traits than I prefer, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've, uh, I've thought about kind of,
cause they were really, they were,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were off the chain, but I got,
I got hung up on what I saw as far as I
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, wasn't terrible, but it was,
you know, when we stressed, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we do is stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just use, mostly we use, what I've
learned is that when you find those,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's mostly a root bound plants,
you know, sometimes I can't get heat to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know, excessive heat, but I can
get a plant in a solo cup to do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, I, we, you know, we're testing
them with smaller pots and we did find
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, basically if I find two and like,
say, you know, 30 or 50, I don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: have numbers on that, but somewhere in
that range, that's too much for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, but we've have thought about
putting those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, I was so high at such high
expectations on that one that I got really
[SPEAKER_02]: disappointed when I saw that, of course I
never released the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I try to stay away from that,
but we did just make a shit ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think if I had the favorite,
if I could pick one, um, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, like there's so many, we just did a
bunch of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't even have to get the list
out to tell you it's like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's like 26 different ones
that we re rocked, you know, but I did
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I did have a lot of problems with
the banana OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of a outside of my realm and
we started to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little cross, like crossing with some
things we've made it's females.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've selected our own stuff, like the dog
roller, um, the, uh, the diesel poison,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I mentioned, the pole dog,
you know, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were starting to cross into that and
see what we find there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's some reason, good shit
there, but, um, nothing really that I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like I just tried to fall in love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, I, I get,
I can, I can go, I can get all emotional
[SPEAKER_02]: about something pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to check myself and you know,
play it out and let things just kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, then try not to have too high of
expectations, big or low, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always think to myself, like,
I'll have a few favorites and maybe one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two of them will pan out to be what I
hoped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe the others don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there'll always be one that I
wasn't particularly invested in that
[SPEAKER_01]: proves to be like one of the really good
pairings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess it's kind of what you're
saying, you know, like it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't really call it either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, you more, more times than
not, I get surprised, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like this is not one that I had a lot of
hope in and then boom, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to stay out of that, you know,
I learned to do that with many things in
[SPEAKER_02]: my life, even with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to ask, I saw, I believe in
your stories or somewhere that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to retire the BX two male and
upgrade to the BX three only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a bit about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just, it came down like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I kept them both because I,
when I'd made different crosses with each
[SPEAKER_02]: one, you know, the same cross,
but with each, uh, male, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes I would find better qualities
and traits in one versus the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And often sometimes it was the BX two that
was, that had the better traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I figured, well, we better keep it
around, but it wasn't that it wasn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: that big of a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as time went on, the more we did that,
the more we looked, it really was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it became like obvious, like we've moved
on from it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just, we retired it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gone now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even have him anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided to put him down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it just maybe a little bit too,
like overthinking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then after that was over,
it was like, wow, we don't really need
[SPEAKER_02]: this anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's let it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I crossed with the chem sis and,
you know, I couldn't tell which one was
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt at one time that the, uh,
the, the BX two was better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kept that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably the one that made me
keep it to like, that was the ones like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think, you know, I like this better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to keep this, but you know,
time and space and like space is a big
[SPEAKER_02]: thing and we just don't have room for it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get, we want to put more males in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, there was nothing really wrong
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, it's just kind of was
like, what's the point, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to retire it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the next question is,
do you have any plans to make a BX four?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've made a BX four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then what would that have been in
2009, 2019, when I was still in Sonoma
[SPEAKER_02]: County, we had the fires come through
really close and we had to be evacuated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was, I just taking clones of
everything to replace all my mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the evacuations became mandatory
and where I was living at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like at a very high vantage point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonoma County, I could actually see the
fires, which as a bird flies, maybe 20
[SPEAKER_02]: miles away, maybe not even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, when those, when those,
um, what do they call those things?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, El Diablo, is that what they call
those winds?
[SPEAKER_02]: El Diablo winds come through.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: This happens quite often.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's happening right now in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when it happened, when that happens
and it happens, you know, September,
[SPEAKER_02]: October, the wind's gusts can be so dry,
the humidity can drop so low and the winds
[SPEAKER_02]: can be so powerful that they can do this
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figure what they call it, but where the
fire jumps from tree top to tree top and
[SPEAKER_02]: it can spread so fast at that point that,
you know, you really literally have to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like the evacuations make sense when
that kind of situation arises,
[SPEAKER_02]: something they can't predict.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we, you know, I grow weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stayed put during the mandatory
evacuations, no power, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the power has already been off for a few
days before these evacuations come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because of the fire and luckily for
me, I had everything rooted in rock wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, I, what I did is I set up my RV
with my sunlight, my skylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the clones in, I, you know,
I don't put them in there cause I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: generator, but I have a spot ready for
them in case I have to blaze really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fill up the art.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like something became like,
um, you know, a regular occurrence,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, something that we had to do all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, put all the finance,
you know, the, all the papers,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the important papers, all the photos,
the crystals, the CD collection,
[SPEAKER_02]: all in the RV and waiting for us to
evacuate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I put the RV in front of my
location and then I would hide the
[SPEAKER_02]: generators between, you know, behind the
RV, between the house, hiding them from
[SPEAKER_02]: the street because it's a mandatory
evacuation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would go up to the top of the hill
on foot and we would watch and see how the
[SPEAKER_02]: fire's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could also see if any authority law
enforcement or fire department was coming
[SPEAKER_02]: up the hill, um, because we're not
supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would shut the generators off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also had solar, uh, battery so we could
have all of our lights and refrigerators
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, our refrigerator stuff on,
but no grow lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would shut all that shit off before
they got to our street.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was a fucking cat mouse game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it went on for almost, I believe
that time it was like 10 weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 days, you know, it was a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not really, you shouldn't,
if you drive away from your house,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you leave, you can't come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, once you leave, you have to be
raising to not come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so food, all that water, all these
things, you know, you have to be ready for
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that happened, I didn't lose
anything except for the BX four that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I didn't really get a lot that
feedback on it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't find it, do a lot of testing with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did cross with the headband and we
released it at that harvest, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: cup and Worcester, uh, was it that year?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was that year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right before COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, um, so, and then once I lost
it, I just kind of, I kind of haven't gone
[SPEAKER_02]: down that road.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, with what we're doing
next, there's going to be a lot of clone
[SPEAKER_02]: only is released and I'm working
constantly on, you know, the backs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the background of my life,
I'm just working on an IBL, a chem dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of like, I feel like it's
going to maybe never happen, or it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take the rest of my life to make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the BX four was part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we, we are getting ready to go through
all the rest of the BX three seeds that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have, uh, to select females and maybe to
take the feed the male one more step.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to spray the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to spray the males that I select
and kind of figure out what we got from
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do maybe do some testing here with the
lab, the local lab here, um, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, um, once we reverse it,
if that seems like a good idea at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but right now with everything else
going on, it's just kind of like on a side
[SPEAKER_02]: burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to ask, I've seen some cool
crosses popping up in your stories,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some, some pollinated moms for some
upcoming projects, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that sort of grabbed my
attention the most was there was quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: few moms in there that were like new to
the arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't necessarily expect them to
pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I saw just a bit earlier,
there's a grape and cream cross chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: BX three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a little bit about some of these
new moms that have joined the ranks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what we have driving right now is we
have the four Kings OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have five Oh one OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we did our 88 G 13 chem selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, then we've got our banana OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new one for us here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had it a long time ago, but now we've
got it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we crossed with the black triangle
caps, frozen lemons, kind of so,
[SPEAKER_02]: so on that one carbon candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new one for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we had a selection of Kim Cornelia and
that's our cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim and dog cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have a Kim born 13 selection in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we did have a lot of our own
selections in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's our airborne G 13 cross with
Kim 91 BX three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we did our chewy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So white runs cross with our Kim dog,
our selection of that deep in butter,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my buddy Gabby, you know,
Gabby, and we've talked with him before he
[SPEAKER_02]: gave that to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, our diesel poison selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did our dog beach selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our Virginia, Afghani, Virginia
beach, Afghani cross selection,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dog roller I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got our GMO root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loves that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got that one in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Griller glue number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a grilled blue number four that
was recently taken out of, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: off a gen zero cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's super duper like healthy and
vibrant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went ahead and crossed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gate, the great gas, the grapes and
cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you heard of that one.
It's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, I believe it's an exotic Mike,
I think it's exotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We liked that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got that one from Gabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joker 31 figured why not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the killer queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be happy to hear the bomb and
number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's another one of,
uh, exotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had, uh, my, my lady found a
nice selection of Larry OG by SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got that one in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, Larry unicorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got that one in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have, uh, one of, uh,
uh, Tommy's, uh, local H in there that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have the Mac one actually took the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like we got quite a few seeds off
the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next one, we took the
classic, the Maui, Wowie, North Calgui two
[SPEAKER_02]: classics right there in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we took the orange tree,
which is one I got from Gabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, uh, he got it from a guy,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know of a Mendozino from green brothers
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give him a little shout out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know he loves that orange tree and
then orangutan titties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another exotics, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pole dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number six.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our 4% Terps selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 29, 30% on the THC total.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put that one in there and then my
lady made some F twos of the punchy
[SPEAKER_02]: bluster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so we selected a net.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the wonderful F twos put that in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple full stack, purple Panther.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had a selection of our raffy
dog, which is our apples and bananas
[SPEAKER_02]: cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my mom, my mom, my mom, RS 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did another one of Tommy's
screaming Eagle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did a lot of like increases,
you know, um, popular ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we did, uh, uh, some grill of Fumay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what else do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one I'm trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, we may have done some with diesel
poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, diesel therapy, these go sour diesel
and slaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was from Gabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did the slice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever heard of that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one that I think Tommy made
Callio, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Callio and his skunk male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did a strawberry diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping we can put some more pump
into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Taliban.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Taliban has been a nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's like a 7%, uh, yielded on the
lot on the, uh, fresh frozen yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's also exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to check with Gabby on some of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are cuts that he held that he passed
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves his exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't he?
[SPEAKER_02]: He, I guess he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, his library is surprising
knowing him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, uh, he's turned me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, some new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unexpectedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He turned me on some newer, newer school
stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another one for my lady,
her selection of triangle pushed by Irene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's, and then we did the white
widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sharon cut we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a lot of people have been asking about
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured we'll run that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there's some other ones,
but those are, those are all the ones I
[SPEAKER_02]: can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, while we're on that topic before
we transition, what's your thoughts on the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like demands growing falling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I have a good perspective
of that, but my perspective is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it's the same as it ever was that
there's some people who just want cheap
[SPEAKER_02]: weed to get high with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some people who,
you know, want the connoisseur grade weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that when you have those two
types of consumers, I think you're always
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get more exposed to the one who
wants to save a few bucks on a Friday
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon before their weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so they have the most joints possible
to smoke during the weekend, but there's
[SPEAKER_02]: still that, you know, we get people out
here and they come to the shop that fly
[SPEAKER_02]: from, you know, pretty far away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we happen to be part of their trip,
you know, here at lucky dog, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bozeman, Montana is a, um, it's a tourist
destination, you know, the Yellowstone
[SPEAKER_02]: parks here, um, for the summertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the winter time we have some
great skiing, snowboarding here at big sky
[SPEAKER_02]: and bridgeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do get a lot of tourism that
that's basically the industry that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that this town has, if it has one,
this area, it's not really just this town,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, just a funny little
story about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in February, this guy, I think he
called the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He found the shop, like on Google,
you know, called it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talked to my employee, Sarah,
and he, he's like, Hey, do you guys have
[SPEAKER_02]: any Kim dog?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, well, you know,
we don't really keep that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for us to keep that on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sells out really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we have a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you coming by today?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, no, I'm in Connecticut and I'll
be there like in a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he, she says, we have like a half an
ounce of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's like, will you save it for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, yeah, let me ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let me ask, you know, the boss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she asked me, I'm like, yeah,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that'd be interesting if he
actually shows up and gets hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he did, he comes back like,
you know, a month or he comes like in a
[SPEAKER_02]: month and you know, he brings his wife and
their own vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to go snowboarding or skiing
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, just check out the hot
springs and, you know, just go have some
[SPEAKER_02]: Montana moments, you know, as we say here
and, uh, and stop by the shop and got his,
[SPEAKER_02]: got all laced up with gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the hoodies and the shirts and the
fucking bought a bunch of flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: him and his wife did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I remember just looking at
his wife and she was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: She was just looking at like, I just kept
catching this look like, what are we
[SPEAKER_02]: doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is what we came for,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gets his half ounce of Kim dog that
we put away for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was the last bit we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so he, that all happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just yesterday coincidentally,
just yesterday, we got a package in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mail and it's from this fella.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and so he sends us, he had like
these tie dyes made.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a 49ers fan like myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking about that when he was
here and he had these tie dyes made with
[SPEAKER_02]: like a pot leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then the rest of the background's
red gold, you know, like the 49ers color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he wrote a little notes and Hey,
you know, we're both 49ers fans and I
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate the, you know, you guys saving
the weed for me and here's shirts for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like five shirts in the thing,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we get a lot of that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So my perspective is a little skewed
because of stuff like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but so, but I would say on the daily,
like people just want to, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just want to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the effect of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they want to lay, they don't want
to break the bank on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the weed is about as cheap as you
can, you know, as you can fucking produce
[SPEAKER_02]: it and sell it for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's about the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, there's more people smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not even sure if that's true
actually, but in my perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's probably more people smoking and
they're probably a different customer than
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever been around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, they're just want to get
their herb and they want to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, enjoy it and you know,
kind of that's their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to spend a lot of money on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they want to get like older weed or
smalls, as you say, you know, then they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: take that if it's at a discount and
there's people that just want the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, that's, that's an interesting
perspective for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess as like an extension of that,
where do you see the price point going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we've hit the rock bottom
with quality flour whereby it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to pick up again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think there might still be a
little more to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your suspicion?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know if I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I have a good view for
that, but I would say that what I think
[SPEAKER_02]: when that comes up is that, you know,
indoor cannabis, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: is easily more, you know, popular or more
desired or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than anything else, any other way you can
grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be, there's a bottom to
where you just, you can't produce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, no matter how much you grow,
there's only so much you can produce at a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain price.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can go, the more you produce,
the more efficient you are, the lower you
[SPEAKER_02]: can, you know, the lower the price can be
when you sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think there's still a
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you still have rent, you still got
electricity, you still got those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how close we are to that,
but it feels to me like we're pretty darn
[SPEAKER_02]: close, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're pretty close to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've dropped our prices, but now we've
literally, you know, I'm embarrassed to
[SPEAKER_02]: say this, but we've literally succumbed to
the cannabinoid levels being the price
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now at Lucky Dog, when you come here,
you can get, when the THC levels are here,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's here, it's this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's here, it's this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I tried to like fight the power,
as you say, and tried to educate the
[SPEAKER_02]: customers, but I'm just one guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the numbers mean everything to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks who smoke, they just don't,
they don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our responsibility to educate them,
but it's not as easy as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier said than done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that like some of the more
legacy strains, like say like your Durbin,
[SPEAKER_01]: Poison, your Chem Dog, like it's sort of
not economically viable to grow them now
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're going to be in the lower
tier, even though it doesn't reflect the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality or the demand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Chem Dog is always around 29,
30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one always goes off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not you've ever heard of it
before, people gravitate towards it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but legacy strains indeed,
like we've been pushing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we keep bringing it up, but the Killer
Queen, we have that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really nice strain, you know,
and we've been pushing that on people and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll come back and buy it, but it's
like 18, 20, 21%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people don't, it's that initial
gravitating, you know, like if you just
[SPEAKER_02]: were like, if people could just pick up
weed and just smell it and be with it for
[SPEAKER_02]: a minute, you know, the way traditional we
always have been, then it might be
[SPEAKER_02]: different, but they're just looking at
numbers and they're looking at a jar with
[SPEAKER_02]: weed in it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't gravitate towards that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to kind of push it on them and
not really push it, but kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, turn them onto it really.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it smells great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just take a smell of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we always tell people, we're like,
listen, it doesn't matter how much THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have strains that are 18%, that'll
fucking knock your socks off compared to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the latest one you heard about
that's at 31%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we explain it to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nobody can cause we'd haven't really
studied it to the point where we
[SPEAKER_02]: understand it, but we tell them what we
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tell them that, you know, the different
levels and combinations of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: the different terpenes, you know,
the combinations of them, they all affect
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC in the way it interacts with your
brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, at some point, like we're
just like talking to a wall, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to be honest, you know, like it's
just, there's only so much we can do to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of push back on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just, it's, that's the way
it is, you know, like the States regulate
[SPEAKER_02]: based on THC percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's the case, then that has to
mean something to the consumer and it
[SPEAKER_02]: means something, but maybe not as much as
they think it means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they still grad gravitate towards
the higher numbers, you know, like here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Montana, which, you know, this is Montana,
like this isn't like your standard
[SPEAKER_02]: American market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here in Montana, like even on the
wholesale level, now it's trickled to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, look at this amazing
weave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the COA?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh, here's the COA.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, yeah, I can't sell that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of sad, but we're never
going to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always going to have all those.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They deserve to be showcased.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to like fall in line and
just grow high percentage THCs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're not doing that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but truthfully, it does matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's just being honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does matter to the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something which is sort of like
the 50 to 100 year extension of that
[SPEAKER_01]: question that I've been thinking a lot
about recently is, do you think that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, say in 50 or 100 years,
we're going to get to a point where sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of like where the wine world's at,
where there's only really like 40
[SPEAKER_01]: well-known grape varietals that are grown
and there's not really much grape breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we'll get to that point with
cannabis or they'll always remain a demand
[SPEAKER_01]: for a much greater diversity of offering?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's where cannabis and
wine grapes differ.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certainly a wide variety of flavor
in the grape, you know, the wine grape
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's generally, I don't know how
many strains that, you know, wine grapes
[SPEAKER_02]: started off with, maybe, you know,
but, you know, how many different flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think cannabis is different because of
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it separates a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more of a, you know,
a winemaker can change the flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like soil, a terrar can change
the flavor of wine, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we both, we generally use some
semi-sterile medias when we grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant itself does all of the,
with certain environmental inputs and
[SPEAKER_02]: other inputs, I think that cannabis can
demonstrate different flavor profiles,
[SPEAKER_02]: strain by strain, but generally the
strains themselves, what the variety is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we're going to probably have
more strains than we want now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we probably have more strains than we
want going into the future even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what separates cannabis and
wine grapes is that for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just a wider variety of flavor in
cannabis than wine, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there's a lot of creation wine
grapes and even wines grown year to year,
[SPEAKER_02]: different regions are grown, all those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis is more, it's simpler,
I guess you could say it's like this
[SPEAKER_02]: strain tastes this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strain tastes that way and they don't
taste anything alike, but they're still
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually a really interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't considered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diversity of flavor in cannabis
certainly makes it a distinguishing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we move on to the grateful head,
which we'll jump into in just a moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask, one last question,
which is that almost everyone I've spoken
[SPEAKER_01]: to who makes or sells seeds in the past,
say 10 episode has mentioned to some
[SPEAKER_01]: effect that it just feels like the demand
for feminized seeds is ever increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you considered doing some FEM work
for the public or at least have you had
[SPEAKER_01]: any thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we actually have and we've
collected some pollen here, stored it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely not against it, but I don't
think I have any fresh ideas when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to feminized seeds that aren't already
being done, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that being said, we are
definitely going to focus on making some
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually, you know, STS spray is,
you know, it's pretty standard thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, we have our own that we've
mixed up and we sell over at Breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: Direct Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're definitely going to be
selling some feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be producing some this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't, we've produced it only enough
for us to do a little testing in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get through those and pick
which ones that we're going to put in
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we, there's nothing against
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, there's nothing really,
there's no new ideas there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I have any fresh ideas with
regular seeds, but it feels more fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: than, you know, just taking two clone
only's and crossing them in a feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: manner and selling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think there's already enough of
that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not something that, it's not like
a big passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like it might pay the bills,
but it's not like something that I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, I can't wait to see what we can
come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like a fresh idea to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've grown some feminized seeds
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, my experience, I've never been like
super duper thrilled with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really agree that it's a way to
like making S1's.
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience and watching others that
have made them and growing their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really feel like that's a great
preservation method.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really feel that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that tissue culture,
you know, synthetic seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a clonal seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's more how I would prefer to
do genetic preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're starting to look into like cryo
storage, which is really complicated
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but I'm not afraid of complicated
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love complicated stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, to me, it's like at making
feminize crosses a, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not really some, you know,
like amazing idea of creation that I have
[SPEAKER_02]: more than what's already being done making
S1's to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I'm very like data oriented,
logical oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's for preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when you look at it, yeah,
it's a method of preservation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's like a flash resort now in 2024
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, 2010, it would have
made a lot more sense for preservation
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons, but we have the cannabis has now
entered into the mainstream
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have real methods to preserve
genetics long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so with that being said,
I do get a lot of questions about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, we have all the tools
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the genetics here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to make some, some feminize
crosses and some S1's definitely some chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog family S1's that way, you know,
when you get your chem dog S1's you get
[SPEAKER_02]: them from the chem family and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's kind of how I feel
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it doesn't inspire me at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just like, it would be
meeting a demand, but it wouldn't do much
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, other than maybe pay a bill or
two, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some other projects and let's
dive into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the last time I spoke to you,
you were really passionate and talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about getting a lab going of your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, it wasn't this current
manifestation, the grateful head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to know how did you sort of
progress since that time to where we are
[SPEAKER_01]: now and get involved in this current
project and tell us a bit about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so of course getting into it,
like I told you before, it's a,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you have a lot of,
when you have a large library and anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: out there who has one will tell you it
consumes your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no vacations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, you know, there's no going
away out of town without a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, problems that you have to solve
before you even leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as time goes by, it's like,
geez, man, you're getting older.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go have a life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So storage is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we have a lot of cultivars
here that will never leave our hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll always take care of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not really popular at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they will be popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't also don't really care if they're
popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, they're standalone genetics
that deserve to be preserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I'm known for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I'll always be
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like a weirdo about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like a collector or something,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so naturally like tissue culture is a
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and that's like the basis of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the motivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, before I went through a
lot of, I talked to a lot of lab operators
[SPEAKER_02]: about their services and see if there
could be some sort of partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just couldn't get past the parts of,
I just couldn't feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just, maybe it's ridiculous,
but I couldn't feel that connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't feel that honesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't feel like that real true,
let's work together for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, probably overthinking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably I'm a hard ass, but still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to take it on my own a long
time ago, you know, not a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: but years ago, but it's a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to teach yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took courses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually took my training in
Northampton, which is one of the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was popped coincidentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned out to be coincidentally,
you know, learned how to do, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic seeds, learned how to do nodal
tissue culture, learned about the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and plant aseptic practices, had some
background in that because I'm,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I've got a little bit of my
ecology under my belt for my own personal
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then of course, Mary Stem
harvesting, which is kind of the pinnacle
[SPEAKER_02]: of that for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then, and then learning about
hormones, plant hormones, how to,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to manipulate plants with hormones,
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, okay, now what?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got to get the lab going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here at the shop, you know,
we, we had a mother room and you shut the
[SPEAKER_02]: mother room down, rented another spot
across the parking lot here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's the mother room, which is
better size for the mother room and turn
[SPEAKER_02]: the previous mother room into a tissue
culture lab and got into it, started doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it and started to find out that it was a
lot more learned than I even knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yes, we're clear of hoplite and
viroid here, but there's more to it than
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pathogens that are really,
you know, the ones that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: preventing you from seeing the cannabinoid
potential, the terpene potential,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just the, the, the growth potential,
like there's the vigor is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, they're fungal endo, endophytes,
there's bacterial endophytes, and those
[SPEAKER_02]: things are systemic in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are beneficial to cannabis
and some of lots, most of them are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, plants pick this up over
years and years and years of storage in
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional manner, traditional cloning,
traditional, just mother rooms,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, bringing in mothers,
mothers leaving, there's all kinds of shit
[SPEAKER_02]: that goes off.
[SPEAKER_02]: on that we don't even see stuff that we
don't even have names for really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as I started putting all my library
into noble tissue culture, I started to
[SPEAKER_02]: really, cause you know, just, just to like
kind of make some understanding of that is
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, if you're free and clear
of hoplite and viroid and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: other more serious viruses or,
but really hoplite and viroid and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you know, then you can just skip
the Mary stem harvesting theoretically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just jump right into noble tissue
culture, where, as opposed to taking the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary stem, in case anybody doesn't
understand this, the Mary stem is at the
[SPEAKER_02]: apical point of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the very new shoot that pops out,
the very first shoot and any branch in any
[SPEAKER_02]: location has what they call a Mary stem at
the very tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Mary stem has got all the genetic,
the genetic code of that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it hasn't been connected to the
vascular system of the plant yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those pathogens that I talked about the
endophytes, the bacterial endophytes,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fungal endophytes, and any viruses or
viroids, hoplite and viroid, they haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed over into that material yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is that if you harvest
that successfully, and put it in vitro and
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture in a sterile environment to
grow, with a nutrient rich, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: agar, then you can grow that plant out
from something the size of a penhead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's almost too small to
see with your eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes some time, but it will grow
out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've, we can manipulate it with
hormones to grow from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that happens and we're successful,
once those shoots start coming out after
[SPEAKER_02]: time, we can subculture those into other
sterile environments and keep the root
[SPEAKER_02]: system off of them, but still multiply
them once again, you know, manipulating
[SPEAKER_02]: them with, with hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, didn't really feel like I
needed to do that when I started putting
[SPEAKER_02]: my library in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started doing nodal tissue culture,
which means I'm just taking a plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking a node and I'm getting rid of
all the material I can off at leaf and
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving just the smallest part of a node.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I sterilize that surface,
because I can't sterilize internally,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I sterilize it on the surface with,
you know, bleach, a bleach solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have used ethanol,
but 10%, 15% to 20% bleach solution,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agitating is usually considered enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you put it into your,
you know, all this is done under sterile
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it in your sterile medium and then
you can grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll start growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all seen that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people understand what that
is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I found out is, is that even
though I was free and clear of viroids,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, you know, a piece of RNA,
I did have like any plant will have
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, you know, any amount of time years
old, especially 30 years old is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have some bacterial endophytes in it,
or maybe even a fungal up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that, so, okay, when you do any
kind of like, you know, aseptic practice,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like when you do any kind of
like tissue culture, or if you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: mycology and you've done anything like
that, you know, within a few days,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have contamination, you know,
you'll see the contamination growing on
[SPEAKER_02]: your media.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a bacterial, a systemic bacterial
endophyte will demonstrate, you won't see
[SPEAKER_02]: it for two, three, four weeks after you've
determined your culture is contaminant
[SPEAKER_02]: free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like I said, that was something I
wasn't really prepared for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that what that made me realize is
like, even though I don't have,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not dealing with hoplite and viroid
here, at the time, knock on wood,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's other things to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even though you don't have that
viroid, those other endophytes or what are
[SPEAKER_02]: making you, or what you're seeing in the
expression of your plant that is not what
[SPEAKER_02]: it used to be, you know, declined
caminoids, declined terpene levels,
[SPEAKER_02]: those types of things, this more finite,
you know, of the what's going on with the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you put a plant into tissue
culture, there's a couple things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, if you successfully initiate a
plant into tissue culture, and you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: see any, you know, fungal growth,
and then eventually you don't see any
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria, or bacterial growth,
well, and then you don't grow any roots on
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant, because that's how it is in
tissue culture when you're multiplying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the plant has time, and by the way,
the growth is slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can even slow it down with cold
storage, which is really beneficial when
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes to allele repair, DNA repair of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people say, oh, these plants,
you know, they came from Gen Zero tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture, look how much vibrant they are,
look how much vigorous they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, they're growing faster than all these
other plants, including the clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: the traditional clone plant of the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the reason why is because,
you know, the plant has had time to repair
[SPEAKER_02]: some of its DNA, something that,
you know, I don't think humans are very
[SPEAKER_02]: adapted doing, but plants are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are so adaptable that it's beyond,
you know, we don't even understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptation qualities of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we don't even appreciate it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were able to look back to
history and the evolution of plants and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how they've come from the
beginning of time to now, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the qualities they've done is
one of the qualities that a plant has is
[SPEAKER_02]: it can repair its alleles basically,
and kind of repairs DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, if you're able to outgrow any of
those endophytes, you know, one example
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know, when you take clones,
you know, people who take lots of clones
[SPEAKER_02]: will understand this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes you'll get like this
brown slime on your roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't understand where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that fungus isn't even in
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes it is also in the air,
but it can also just be systemic in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that plant that cutting pops out
roots, well, those those endophytes go to
[SPEAKER_02]: work and they start propagating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're starting to see a fungus
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can eliminate those things with with,
you know, quality tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: practices, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I when I back while saying so,
when I discovered like, oh, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more to this than I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm going to have to take my
whole library and put it in America,
[SPEAKER_02]: like harvest the Mary stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think I was going to have to do
that because, you know, we test here at
[SPEAKER_02]: the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the we use to me and now we use to
me glow so we can test right here in in in
[SPEAKER_02]: house for hop late.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way we can get regular testing
and just make sure, you know, we do bring
[SPEAKER_02]: a new clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a protocol for how would they
come in and, you know, the time period
[SPEAKER_02]: before they can be tested and the time
period before they can be introduced to
[SPEAKER_02]: the main population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm big on redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I keep we keep the practices here as if
we have problems because we, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just because we don't have hop late in
here doesn't mean that other things can't
[SPEAKER_02]: be spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use the same protocol for sanitary
conditions, regardless of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on with the library,
regardless what the testing tells us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The testing just tells us where we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it doesn't give us like,
you know, I've seen people out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, oh, I just tested my whole crop
and I don't have to worry about this and
[SPEAKER_02]: this and this and the protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I disagree with that because a we
don't you can test a plant several times
[SPEAKER_02]: before you find out it actually comes
positive because the way hop late and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid spreads around a plant,
you know, it starts at a at a wound
[SPEAKER_02]: usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: More I think more often than people
realize it actually comes from the root
[SPEAKER_02]: system sharing what water runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't always know, you know,
like you can you can make the wrong guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I say, when when you make that
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's better to keep the protocol in
place, regardless what the testing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the people who come in,
you know, my guy, ginger grower who goes
[SPEAKER_02]: and takes some cuts, he doesn't know if I
have a negative or positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we always we don't have any
positives, but there's no need to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell him I don't want to get comfortable
around, you know, the plants because he
[SPEAKER_02]: has a false sense of security about it,
you know, which can easily happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't say for sure either,
because if we're bringing new plants in,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though they go through the protocol
pop late and affects different affects
[SPEAKER_02]: different cultivars differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just because it grew super fast in this
Maui dog doesn't mean it's growing fast in
[SPEAKER_02]: this whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some plants, it hits them really hard
and fast and some plants they can,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean, sour diesel,
I've seen this with my own eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it can be severely infected and
still produce cannabinoids and still
[SPEAKER_02]: produce terpenes, you know, at high
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be really difficult to just know
that you have it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even though I've never tested that
particular plant for hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: positive or negative, I would say that you
would probably get, you know, you'd get
[SPEAKER_02]: different results on the tighter levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't you wouldn't you may not
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every test may be able to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may not even test the right spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tests are getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now we're testing the roots,
which I think is, you know, a step in the
[SPEAKER_02]: right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's better to understand how
things work as opposed to guessing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and there's been a lot of
guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're starting to understand
things that, you know, hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: starts in a part of the plant and then it
goes to the root system and then
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually it spreads to the new growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, it spreads to the
older growth, you know, but not always.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how it usually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the point is, just do the protocol,
you know, clean your scissors,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean your hands, 10 percent at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK to use 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself some scissor sharpeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to dull your scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, take the time, you know,
sanitize your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a full 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not think about what happens if
something goes wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the time, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting a little sidetracked here
from your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is, is that I built the lab
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then once that door opened and it's
been I've been working on that door for
[SPEAKER_02]: two, two plus years now, as far as you
know, when I when I do something,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for for cannabis in my career,
I make sure I understand it top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I make sure that, you know,
it's easy to go hire someone who can do
[SPEAKER_02]: something for you or understand it for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't sleep at night with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sleep better than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand it top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know the right questions to
ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the right answers when I'm asked
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I've been spending my
time doing, you know, and I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's kind of what's led to
what's happening now, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I realize that even though I try
to do everything myself and I try to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in house like I just described,
it just doesn't always work out that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you need a team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you need people around you who
have the same goals in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's kind of where my
life is at right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've that paradigm of it's OK to have a
team, not just, you know, not just people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are hired, you hired to do what you
need them to do, but like a team of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are thinking the way you think,
that are approaching problems the way you
[SPEAKER_02]: approach them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very valuable, you know, because not
any one of us is dealing with this on our
[SPEAKER_02]: own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will only get dealt with as a
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's bigger than people realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more rampant than people realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: The faster weed goes into this legal
space, the more education is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: required to deal with the things that we
have to deal with, such as hoplite and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be more pathogens
that are going to be as detrimental or
[SPEAKER_02]: more detrimental than this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to like we have to be prepared
to meet those challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like for me, hoplite and
viroid and watching how it's affecting
[SPEAKER_02]: folks in the world and the potential
damage it can do to a business,
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like training wheels for the
next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like get the protocols,
get the right frame of mind and especially
[SPEAKER_02]: the right team around you to be able to to
be prepared for what's coming next,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there will be something next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may not be as simple as,
you know, cleaning it up with the meristem
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture remediation, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I think I got off track there,
but you know, I think somewhere there was
[SPEAKER_02]: an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did predict my next answer,
which was going to be asking you,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think there's going to be another
virus in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer you said was yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we jump back to where we were,
I want to quickly ask you, I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotally that after a particular
genetic undergoes meristem tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: just again, anecdotally, people say,
oh, you notice it's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number I heard was like maybe like
15% better in terms of like across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board, not in one particular aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like maybe it's more
vigorous and maybe there's a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and a bit more turps and just sort
of, you know, like 15% better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you, would you say that it's more
than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts when you hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all relational to where you're
starting from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you've got a plant,
I think the gorilla glue number four is a
[SPEAKER_02]: great example, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, from what I gather, that was a big
culprit of sick plants getting other
[SPEAKER_02]: plants sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got spread around really quickly at
some point years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a lot of people spread
around that hot plate and viral at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to use that one as an example,
it's like night and day, I would say 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have a lot of experience with it
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some, but not a lot before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the clean version we have now
that's basically came from a gen one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's night and day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost doesn't seem like the same
wheat, same wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you'll show it to people who tell you
that, you know, gorilla glue was always
[SPEAKER_02]: one of their favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I remember the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you show it to them and like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, it's the same one,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe on an average,
I don't know if I could answer that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think the potential is much,
you know, much greater than that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends on where you start from.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was a, you know, sort of sick plant
or sort of not well, or maybe not that
[SPEAKER_02]: oval plant, maybe the difference isn't
that big, but generally it's like night
[SPEAKER_02]: and day, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the vigor is completely out of
control, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it on the stems, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it on the stalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it like it's just vigorous,
more lively.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it was just popped right not
that long ago from a seed, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as a quick follow up,
how would you compare the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between, say, doing the nodal harvesting
versus Meristem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there quite a big difference when you
go to that Meristem level?
[SPEAKER_02]: So not necessarily, because like I said,
if you have a generally clean plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you initiate it nodally, you're not
going to, you know, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: see a whole lot of difference when it
comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant was pretty clean when it came
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to see a lot of
difference between a Meristem Gen Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just say, I don't think that's a
real term, but a nodal Gen Zero,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant that just came right out of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's say that plant, you know,
cause when, once you're in Meristem,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, really you're just mostly,
when you go through tissue, the tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture process, you're eventually going
to get rid of all those fungal and
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterial endophytes, like I was saying
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Meristem is more for, go on in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Meristem is more for just like,
you know, remediation, it remediates,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all those fungal bacterial
endophytes, but also more importantly,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the only way that we have currently
to remediate from the viroid, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like comparing when you're
talking about the way you described it,
[SPEAKER_02]: like apples and oranges, but at the end of
the day, you know, it's going to be about
[SPEAKER_02]: the same because the, the genetic repair
that it goes through, it goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the cleaning up of the
endophytes, the bacterial or fungal,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to happen with the,
with the nodal too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Meristem, we would just cut to the
chase and just do that anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if we didn't have the viroid,
because it's a quicker way to guarantee
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're not going to bring any of those
bacterial or fungal endophytes into the
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you understand what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, I mean, just to quickly bring
this back to where we were, how did you
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially get involved in the Grateful
Head Endeavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it all start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've told us it was on your
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, that's funny you say that
because I believe that we kind of manifest
[SPEAKER_02]: our reality, you know, I'm one of those
that believe that we talk things into
[SPEAKER_02]: existence, that we think things into
existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, this is on my mind
constantly for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've gone through a lot of the labs
and, you know, I won't mention any names,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you've heard of them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just couldn't make me feel
comfortable with who they were,
[SPEAKER_02]: what their goals were, and, you know,
how that would affect me in a partnership
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, like I said, back to what I was
saying, like I tried to go at it my alone
[SPEAKER_02]: and sure, I could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like it's bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I'm thinking about this,
I, I like to post on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, when I open up my Instagram feed,
it's mostly laboratories that I'm that
[SPEAKER_02]: that the algorithm wants me to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not the pretty flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that too, but mostly it's
laboratories, techniques, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, petunias and begonias and,
you know, fruit crops and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit like bioscience, like, you know,
agricultural science is fascinating to me
[SPEAKER_02]: as I've gotten to this point in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of where my, you know,
it's just what interests me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so plus with the tissue culture thing,
the algorithm knows what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it can figure out what I was
thinking yesterday, you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like the post of a fella and he
immediately hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, we should talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called him up and that's not,
you know, me, that's not something I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to even get me on the goddamn
phone, but I called him up and we just hit
[SPEAKER_02]: it right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he was pretty forward and
invited me to, to join the cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I kicked the idea around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, you know, the last year,
I've gone through this last year and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half, I've kind of gone through this
paradigm shift in my own, my own universe,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is I used to be like,
you know, I've been collecting clones and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, taking care of them and spending
every resource I have to make sure they're
[SPEAKER_02]: safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even sometimes the last fucking dollar to
make sure that the plants are fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about me and my, you know,
so, you know, it's a big deal to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like I've gone from,
you know, these things are so valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you put a price tag on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you sell to someone else?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, how do you like,
like, like what, what use does that have?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like selling a genetic to
someone, you know, like selling a clone
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of a clone only that you can't get to
someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what use does that have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've always kind of felt like that
was no real use to that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're going to go off and make a
bunch of money with it, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is that really, is that really all
it's for?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mind was like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of always tended not to
share genetics, clone only is not to
[SPEAKER_02]: share, you know, you know, my library with
folks, not to sell it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though I could at any time,
I just chose not to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the last year, I've been kind of
watching the industry and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: watching, you know, one by one breeders
start to sell their breeding clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, their, you know, their
selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, then you go out on the
internet now and there's like clones
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere you can buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so my girlfriend started buying
clones from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm such a anal person that I
wasn't even like sharing with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, next thing you know,
there's Hoplite and Viroid popping up and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, now we're dealing with that and
trying to like, you know, protect the
[SPEAKER_02]: library from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, God, these, then you call
the company up and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't test for Hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, we don't have the money for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You sold the clone for $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have the money for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just blew my mind how careless some of
these clone sellers were being,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I just was like, oh my God,
now this, we're going to drop to this
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking level now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so over the course of the last year
and a half, I've just kind of come around
[SPEAKER_02]: to the idea that, you know what,
maybe, maybe it is a good idea if we do it
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe it is a good idea if we
are good stewards of the plant and sell
[SPEAKER_02]: clones that are clean, sell genetics that
are clean and like well taken care of and
[SPEAKER_02]: verified, you know, there's that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you never know what you're getting
and at a fair price, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that makes sense for us and
keeping it for so long and holding onto it
[SPEAKER_02]: and all the resources that are we
committed to the library, but also,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to making sure that the guy with
the tent in Texas can, like I mentioned to
[SPEAKER_02]: you before, can afford it and get that
fucking headband or whatever the fuck it
[SPEAKER_02]: is he wants in his tent, you know,
without spending, you know, breaking the
[SPEAKER_02]: bank, spend thousands of dollars or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I'm coming to that kind of paradigm
shift in my head and just different ways
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeing things, this whole thing
happened where I liked this post and this
[SPEAKER_02]: fellow, you know, reached back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on a phone call.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, of course, my first like
inclination was kind of to push back and
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, J.K., be careful,
you know, like people say things and but
[SPEAKER_02]: it just I just kept it kept fitting
together like a puzzle every conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the course of like two months,
we started talking and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like quite often about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was taking it very serious,
the idea in my mind, my personal life,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was bouncing off my family and,
you know, the people that I trust and care
[SPEAKER_02]: about their opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I decided to go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I decided to enter into an
agreement with the company and be part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, part of the board of
directors on a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just once that happened,
it was like a bowling ball, as we say,
[SPEAKER_02]: just started rolling down the hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no way to stop it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like it's brought me such a
relief from the pressure that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: putting on myself about this, that,
you know, there's been a lot of great
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are coming from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't even, you know, we're just
getting ready to do our first drop this
[SPEAKER_02]: summer, August 5th.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, in my own personal life,
just the mental pressure has taken off me
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing that I'm around some men who feel
the same way that I do about all this,
[SPEAKER_02]: completely understand like where we're
coming from when it comes to the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: protecting it and like what it means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, even the guy who approached
me, you know, he had like, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: over speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the exact, but he had like
say 150, 200 cultivars that he did that
[SPEAKER_02]: did get infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, what's the protocol say?
[SPEAKER_02]: It says throw them away, start over,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He chose not to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He reached into his back pocket and he
reached deep and he went to a lab and he
[SPEAKER_02]: got his whole fucking crop remediated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I have so much respect for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say that that's a whole different
ball game to face that reality,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and he did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that, that, that had an impact on
me dealing with this gentleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I realized that I'm not the only
one and that there's other ways besides
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I joined, joined forces and you know,
here we are now, now what's happening is
[SPEAKER_02]: like we're, you know, now we're trying to
keep up with what we, what our plan is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's like a snowball just
going down the hill, a hundred miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to keep it up,
you know, keep up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like the most exciting thing I've
been part of since I can remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, that's, that's,
that's, that's where it starts,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: This all just happened since April.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I feel like we've been
doing it for years already, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just because of all the details and work
we're putting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's really exciting to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're going to have to talk a
whole bunch more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the first question is,
I'm sure people have maybe seen some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other content you've done out there,
but if not, uh, I'm aware that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it with our buddies of the show,
Dutch Blooms and Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a bit about some of the
other people involved and what each person
[SPEAKER_01]: brings in their capacity, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does, how does it all work
logistically?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty much the basis of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, we're all collectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all, you know, long term,
long term, like cannabis enthusiasts,
[SPEAKER_02]: collectors, and, you know, just people who
love the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned, you mentioned Dutch
Blooms, you mentioned Kevin, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, folks have had some exposure to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Kevin is an amazing human.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, of course knew who he was,
but now I've gotten really, I've gotten to
[SPEAKER_02]: know him to a degree, being part of this
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We meet every week and we discuss our
plans and kind of our ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's, it's like a wild,
wildfire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we get together, like we take
the smallest little notion of an idea and
[SPEAKER_02]: within an hour it's blossom into this
giant garden of a, of a, of an idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all because we've been around
this plant for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been around cannabis for so long and
we've been involved to different degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, generally saying,
speaking, we all have our own personal
[SPEAKER_02]: libraries that we've thrown into the
collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's, there's one person that,
um, that you didn't mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the guy I was talking about and
his name is Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we've gotten to know each other
and he's an amazing guy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's, uh, he cares about cannabis as
much as plants, as much as anyone I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of his brainchild.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kind of brought us together,
you know, um, he's a good networker and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's got good ideas and great energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's kind of brought us all together
and, um, you know, made it to where it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it feels like a team, like he,
he did it the way that we all feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like an equal team, you know,
and it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's the four of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a few other people involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know we have a CFO and, you know,
we have a lab partner, um, that we have,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're doing all the, the culture and
the remediation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big, big endeavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a big project, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we're lucky to have a lab that,
that has taken on that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, when you find someone that
can do this kind of work, they have a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, usually a pretty extensive
scientific background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this individual does, I would imagine
there's lots of avenues in life that a
[SPEAKER_02]: person like that could take a lot of
opportunities and, and, um, has chosen to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with cannabis is kind of admirable to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, we're lucky to have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know, things are always
moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always mo, you know, motions are
always have, have happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we're all being in cannabis,
we're all accustomed.
[SPEAKER_02]: To that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time there's like a bump in the
road that we see, we have like a million
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part about it is it's not on
just one person, you know, it's a team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, no, no one person has all
the ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one person has all the solutions or
answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you put some people together that
I, you know, this is my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put some people like that
together, smart people who, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: are engaged in what they do and they care
about what they're doing and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: passion for what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking magical things happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like, it's like I said before,
like speaking things into existence like
[SPEAKER_02]: that on steroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wow, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just growing so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all you can do is say, wow,
this is just meant to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, the motivation,
I think for a lot of us is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how it's being done wrong everywhere,
just across the board and by people who
[SPEAKER_02]: may not quite understand, quite get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to say it, you know,
just may not quite get it the way some of
[SPEAKER_02]: us do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that only comes, not because
people are somewhat different,
[SPEAKER_02]: but because of experience around it and
like seeing what can be good and what can
[SPEAKER_02]: be wrong and being able to kind of
navigate those things when they come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all adapt to that and very
good at dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you know me, I'm a hard
ass, you know, I'm a purist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to fuck around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to like, you know,
but cannabis is going in a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: direction and you can either kind of ride
that you can kind of hold on or you can
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to find ways within myself
to make it better for cannabis in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: based on what I believe, but not just
hiding behind my keyboard or my closet,
[SPEAKER_02]: bitching and moaning about what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But as opposed to like, as opposed to
that, kind of like influencing it and
[SPEAKER_02]: changing it and maybe having a positive
impact on the outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we're all all the
grateful head and the people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with that, myself included,
we all have that in our back of our mind
[SPEAKER_02]: always, you know, that, you know,
it's better to work within a system to
[SPEAKER_02]: change it, to make it more better,
as opposed to just sitting on the outside
[SPEAKER_02]: screaming and pounding your fists and
saying it's not good enough, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been on the outside doing that to
some degree, but I've always known it's
[SPEAKER_02]: better to be on the inside doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the grateful head has an
opportunity for us to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, we are gonna be providing
Gen Zero clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a library, it's almost 600
cultivar clone only deep, and it's growing
[SPEAKER_02]: fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing that, you know,
talk a little bit about is that the part
[SPEAKER_02]: that's snowballing the fastest library,
you know, because of the reputation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that some of us have that we have
individually, it's kind of added to the,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of the validity of the mission that
we're on when it comes to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, genetic, we're genetic
dealers, basically, you know, like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collect and deal genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people doing it just
to quickly make that quick dollar without
[SPEAKER_02]: any regard of, you know, tomorrow or seven
days down the road or seven years down the
[SPEAKER_02]: road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we kind of have a,
for various reasons, we have a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of a vision of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we're able to kind of
apply that to what we're doing today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm involved with this
because I see a lot of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to make excuses for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already on the right pages from my
point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's growing fast and it's
gonna be, it's gonna be big.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have already, I would probably guess
the biggest genetic repository of clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about Gen Zero, forget about tissue
culture, forget about the remediation,
[SPEAKER_02]: forget about all that just in globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're gonna be able to sell these
clones legally to basically anybody the
[SPEAKER_02]: way we have it set up with our licensing
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna get too much into that,
but we are basically able to sell clones
[SPEAKER_02]: to anybody that has a phytosanitary
certification agreement globally and
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly anyone in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I described it is if we can
legally sell you a clone, we're gonna,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can buy a clone for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our library is extensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our first drop is gonna be,
it's between 40 and 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had 60 pulled for it, 60 different
cultivars pulled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of production about if we
meet that number and we're getting some
[SPEAKER_02]: feedback and data on that this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's closer to 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanna make sure we have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers, we're only gonna have about a
thousand clones available on the first
[SPEAKER_02]: drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all Gen Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're partially acclimated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you receive your clone,
you're not gonna have a lot of work to do
[SPEAKER_02]: at acclimating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a nice SOP for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have, we're gonna surround you
with instruction just in case,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to give you the best possible
outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's gonna be, they're gonna be
rooted, viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There just needs to be some small
acclimation and these are sterile plants
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of each row with roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gotta, it's gonna be specific
light requirements, specific feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: requirements and specific humidity
requirements for the first seven to 10
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't be more excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so pumped about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm part of something bigger
than myself and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to hear how excited you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many interesting
follow-up questions I wanna ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the first one is, as you
mentioned, there's this like vast library
[SPEAKER_01]: of genetics contributed by the various
people you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's handling the lab side of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys doing it in-house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you partnering with someone you trust?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's gonna be doing the culturing and
making the clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: The culturing has already been going on
for years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The intake is ongoing and it will always
be ongoing because we're gonna be trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to, not just take existing libraries,
but we're trying to find ways to leave the
[SPEAKER_02]: door open to new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes, you know,
as you've noticed, I'm sure most people
[SPEAKER_02]: can't always notice, like the next
greatest thing doesn't always come from
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest known breeder, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, oftentimes it's fricking
bag scene that someone finds in their
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're developing ways to make
partnerships with breeders known and
[SPEAKER_02]: unknown alike to make sure that we leave
the door open for that material to come in
[SPEAKER_02]: and also that that person who provides
that material is compensated properly for
[SPEAKER_02]: the material, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are things that we're
developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any, like, we don't have
anything to discuss about that yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that is like at the forefront of what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so much what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have that and that's the wheel
that's turning now, but it's the future,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like the next thing the next
genetics, the next big thing, the next
[SPEAKER_02]: trend, you know, the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, on top of keeping like
the old school, the classics around and
[SPEAKER_02]: available to people who some people have
never experienced and now they will have
[SPEAKER_02]: an opportunity experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as the lab goes, one of the
things about collecting genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the key word for collecting
genetics is called is redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I've kept things alive and
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these years and somewhat healthy state
is redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't we have a main lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be working out of
Connecticut because of the laws there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very favorable as far as working
under.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not we're not under FDA
regulations, the Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_02]: Administration of the United States,
but they're the ones that set the rules
[SPEAKER_02]: for hemp regulation in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp is legal 100 percent in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: States have the opportunity to do nothing
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if that's the case, the FDA's
regulations, which are strict,
[SPEAKER_02]: they super they take play.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they they go into effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the rules that you're
going to be working with when you
[SPEAKER_02]: propagate, sell hemp or hemp products.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are in a state that most states
United States have added on top of rules
[SPEAKER_02]: of the FDA hemp guidelines, and so
Connecticut is one of those states that
[SPEAKER_02]: has.
[SPEAKER_02]: But however, they've they've been very
favorable to hemp in that state.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some states that are, you know,
more concerned about synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and are trying to
overregulate hemp based on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Delta, you know, Delta products and
things of that nature, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic cannabinoids that were derived
from hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've kind of overstepped a lot of
their regulation mandates to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: regulate things that aren't really just
hemp, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Connecticut is one of those states
where they've been very friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have a lab there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's that that lab works with a lot of
different plant cultivars, but they've
[SPEAKER_02]: housed, remediated and stored and
multiplied the cult of the existing
[SPEAKER_02]: library that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, intake is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next step for the grateful head is
redundancy, meaning, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're we're developing other labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're thinking about here in Montana here
at Lucky Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're also thinking about,
you know, maybe it would be a good idea to
[SPEAKER_02]: have our Connecticut lab stand place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the main spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then our redundancy could be a West
Coast, you know, a mountain zone,
[SPEAKER_02]: a central zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way we can cut down on shipping
time to have higher success rates through
[SPEAKER_02]: shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of times when you send a
clone to the mailers, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you never know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like someone could just leave
the shipment in a van and it could get
[SPEAKER_02]: cooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not much you can do about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can do what you can to cut down
on those shipping lanes times,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and also have redundancy in your
in your project, I think that'd be useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so the lab is in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we don't really talk about
much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is it's kind of like the safe house as
a so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing that we're focused on now is
the redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, where's the next lab going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the next lab going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, how do we build it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do we make like a,
you know, like what plan would we like
[SPEAKER_02]: work here, here and here?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, what do we really need to
get it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we really need to have it in
operation production?
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's focus on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that's we're already at that
point where that's the next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I said, it's growing a lot
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: We expect it's going to be a pretty big
demand once we release and people start to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the product that we're providing and
the library, the extensive library.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're already trying to think about
the next step because we can already see
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're going to outgrow ourselves
pretty quick here, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so do you plan to always just have all
the labs in-house so you can have like
[SPEAKER_01]: your own SOPs and keep the sort of
consistency high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The IP is shared with you know,
our lab that's been developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been shared with us to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're developing, you know, basically our
own IP based off of that and and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: other input.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will be something that belongs to
the Grateful Head.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think there's been a lot of
discussion about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think going forward, we've realized
that a partnership is great, but it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: a stepping stone to what we really need to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is exactly we said we needed to
be in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, full control of the IP,
full control of the the process,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from from A to B, A to Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't we've you know, it makes sense to
have those partnerships and we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be we'll have those partnerships along the
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we've we've come across we
actually know a lot of you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a lot of resources in that space
in the, you know, biotech space,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant tech space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like as we've kind of let this idea
blossom, we've realized like we have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of resources to where we can kind of build
a team in-house, like you say,
[SPEAKER_02]: and let them rely on that to do the
production and remediation and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, we plan on keeping it in-house
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in partnerships, good partnerships,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but I think going forward,
we're going to be the next step in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next step after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, as you referenced earlier,
it sounds like there's going to be a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of demand for this and it's
probably going to sell out quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard mentions of August being when
the first drop might occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a look on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't any real specific info.
[SPEAKER_01]: When can people expect to be able to get
their hands on these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our targeted date is August 5th.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think that, you know, there'll be like
a two week period between August 5th and
[SPEAKER_02]: August 20th, 21st, where the plants will
be available.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty solid, that's a set in
stone time frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we can't get around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whatever we have when that
happens, that's what's for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as the website goes,
like we, thegratefulhead,
[SPEAKER_02]: the-grateful-head.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is the place where you'll be
able to order your clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have all the forms of
payment available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the list is not up yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we want to make sure we have
a hard number before we offer anything on
[SPEAKER_02]: the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have thought about doing a pre-sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may or may not still happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally speak, generally, I don't think
that's going to be something that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be, you know, a reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have a deal on this
first drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy four, then you will get a fifth
for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think that's going to be a nice kickoff
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clones are going to be priced this
round, $250 for one Gen Zero clone sent to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not selling plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're selling genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are going to spend plenty of time
explaining and showing and demonstrating
[SPEAKER_02]: why that's an amazing deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like one little trip through our
lab with a phone camera and you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly why that's going to be an
incredible deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's only if you can't imagine all
the things that have gone into this
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar being safe and clean and ready to
go, brought to your door besides that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, right now we're going to have a
pre-sale, but when the list is available,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll make announcements on Instagram,
the website, everywhere we can to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure everyone knows where they can go grab
their clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, the question that I'm sure
everyone has on their mind is,
[SPEAKER_01]: will people be able to get their own Chem
91 or are there some plants that will
[SPEAKER_01]: remain off the list?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing from my library is off the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was never a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I went to flip the switch in my head,
it was never going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be doing fun things like
we're going to have like a Chem family
[SPEAKER_02]: collection that you can purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like a box set kind of not on
this first drop, but on, on, on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, drops down the road,
we'll be doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have clusters, you know,
like say you're a, say you're a business
[SPEAKER_02]: and we, we can come and check your market
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can assess your market, basically your
library, your existing library,
[SPEAKER_02]: your existing sales, your cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can provide you clusters of
plants to kind of hit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: different zones and cannabis, you know,
like, you know, like candy, gas,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, those types of things,
you know, we can break them up for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, legacy, we'll throw a legacy in
there for your connoisseurs, that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to, you know, one of the
things that we're going to be doing is for
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial customers, we're going to be
kind of helping them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of guiding them through their own
market space to help them figure out what
[SPEAKER_02]: will work and what won't work with,
you know, with trying to, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: limit any kind of, you know, conformity,
like any kind of a redo's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, try not to saturate too much
candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already got enough of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will work in your candy market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, you know, we, we all,
one of the things that we all have is we
[SPEAKER_02]: have like a sense of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we kind of been around long enough to
see the trends come and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not that difficult for us to
identify them when we're given the data,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we're presenting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the data and, you know, of course we
have assessors we work with that can help
[SPEAKER_02]: with that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no, the Kim 91 will be available right
from my library.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on this first drop, just because
there's a, there's a process to this and
[SPEAKER_02]: the pipeline was already going,
but there's going to be a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my whole library is going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the cool things is, one of the best
things about being involved with this as a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder is this is going to free up a lot
of resources for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get back to selecting seeds,
something I, you know, I'd never have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough time with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always on the back of my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always in front of my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to think about when I wake up
is how, you know, it's what's,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, isn't it like, what's more fun
than Fino hunting?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think really anything is when it
comes to cannabis, that's the most
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting thing about growing cannabis
to me is when you get to go Fino hunting,
[SPEAKER_02]: I rarely get to do that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get this library buttoned up and
it's not a hundred percent my
[SPEAKER_02]: responsibility financially and otherwise
to take care of it, then it allows me to
[SPEAKER_02]: free up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means there's going to be a lot
more to cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a lot more genetics
for us to go find and present to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will all be included too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of things that the
world hasn't seen that are in our
[SPEAKER_02]: libraries that are going to be available
right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess if I push you, you still can't
let us know any of those 40 ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be out front.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I want to throw my guess in the
ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reckon TK has got to be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two TKs in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the swamp boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got, you know, Ricky's TK and then we
got this, the traditional TK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the swamp boy TK and then the original
TK, I guess, or whatever you call that
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I thought Ricky was the one who
found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have thought his would have been
the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the questions I had when I
saw those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned a lot about stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know about coming, you know,
about clone only is being involved with
[SPEAKER_02]: these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm getting schooled daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to listen, you know, that was my
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, uh, I can't wait to
check out the Ricky TK because the swamp
[SPEAKER_02]: boy TK, cause I've heard great things.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are telling me it's like,
uh, they've seen people getting 3.8 pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of light from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the one I got, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I can't wait to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some shit on this library too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing being involved is
like having, having all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: clones that, you know, maybe I've heard
of, maybe I've dreamed of, but right
[SPEAKER_02]: there, my fingertips, I'm, I'm fucking
excited as someone who likes to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, make crosses and do a little
breeding here and there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that it just opens up a whole new world
just for me, myself, and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's, that's a great example right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was going to be one of my
questions, you know, given you've got this
[SPEAKER_01]: new collaboration, we've got access to
this range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any clones now available to you
that you were sort of always eyeing off
[SPEAKER_01]: going, Oh, I would love to have run that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of them, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I should have a list in front of me
to answer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's one that caught my eye that,
that they have is, uh, that I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: who brought it to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that's the other thing we
don't really, um, right now we have it all
[SPEAKER_02]: bunched up into one list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we're still trying to sort
it out in different ways, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like how many different ways can
we organize this to where someone can
[SPEAKER_02]: click on a link and they can go,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause it's so extensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, it's not very useful just to
scroll through it, you know, like you need
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways to kind of filter it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on that with the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ways you can filter it out with all
these different categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there's one, I think it's an NL
two, the red Fino, but I cannot wait to
[SPEAKER_02]: check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe it came from Seattle at some
point, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, um, but I'm looking, that one
caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, that's the only one that comes to
my mind when you asked me that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a lot though it's,
it's extensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same, you know, it's like,
you gotta like, you gotta sit down with
[SPEAKER_02]: this list when you look at it,
cause it's a lot, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, it's growing at like a pace that
none of us expected, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like, how quickly do you estimate
your ramp up to full production where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're offering say a good majority of the
library?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, uh, the, the plan that we have
in place, we'll be producing for sale for
[SPEAKER_02]: a thousand clones a month right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may change upwards depending on
demand, but right now that's what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: told.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, you know, the process to get these
out of tissue culture, multiplied,
[SPEAKER_02]: rooted, partially acclimated on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a pretty, you know,
long process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's a, it's basically on
the production side, like a three month
[SPEAKER_02]: lead time, you know, so these are the ones
that we're going to put on the,
[SPEAKER_02]: on, you know, on the list for three
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's start the process, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the goal right now is a thousand
clones a month starting in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like, I've got to ask,
do you think you might ever foresee a day
[SPEAKER_01]: where you would consider shipping like the
Maristem in the agar or do you think it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: always be like a clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to be able to provide our
material to, you know, people in many
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're going to have males,
you know, breeding males.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have males that are
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have plenty in the library.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there'll be more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm going to be committing some males
to that part of the library as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, one of the things that
we would encourage people to do is take
[SPEAKER_02]: your clone and then put it back in,
you know, culture, put it back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: subculture, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if we do get enough, um,
so what that means is like, so I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to take this clone out and expose it
to, to the world of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to keep it in vitro so I can,
at my own house or my own facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can keep this going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you could take this clone,
put it back in the vitro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's barely out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then you can continue to,
to, uh, multiply it and then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: provide yourself with clean clones
constantly, clean gen one clones all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so if we find interest in that,
yes, we will be providing cultures on,
[SPEAKER_02]: on plates actually, uh, for people who
have that skill level in order to know
[SPEAKER_02]: what to do with those and how to handle
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, every which way we can think of to
provide these work, we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: implement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like I said, even males, you know,
like breeding males that people may want
[SPEAKER_02]: to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're not, the door is going to be
completely open.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is a deep, decentralized,
um, genetic repository.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're not holding back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not, we're not interested in you
being a return customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only interested in you being a happy
customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we know the joy people get when
they've been looking for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: such and such cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've, they smoked it, you know,
20 years ago, 15 years ago, or just the
[SPEAKER_02]: other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just want to grow it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's, you're our, you're our
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we want to help you with that,
you know, like that's, we know the joy of
[SPEAKER_02]: that and we want to bring that joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's big part of what we're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so if we find that there's people
who want to have material provided to them
[SPEAKER_02]: in vitro, then certainly we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's exciting as well to also
hear about the, the males that will be on
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess soon enough you'll, you'll be
offering absolutely everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a, I had a really good fan submitted
question that I wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were sort of thinking,
look, I'm planning to buy one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to scrub my medium first?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because obviously some of these
viruses and endophytes can exist within
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and other mediums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think if you're going to go to the
effort of getting one of these clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's worth just cleaning shop,
getting a new medium, or do you think,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look, you're probably safe just to put
a clean client in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it depends on what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we're just talking about a
regular grow room, there's no reason why
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't just put it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, once you take a clone out of vitro and
you start multiplying it outside of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, aseptic conditions, whatever's going
to happen is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: However dirty or clean your grow room,
it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's basically like,
it's like hitting a reset button,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like you're going to hit the
reset button, but that doesn't mean you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be golden forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still life goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I always, I, when I think about it in
my mind, I think about it like cassette
[SPEAKER_02]: tapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This may be, I might be too old for your
audience here when I come to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but back in the day when we had great for
dead tapes, you would get the recording on
[SPEAKER_02]: a DAT digital audio recording,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that would come from a taper that was
tapped into the soundboard or even their
[SPEAKER_02]: own microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they would take that tape and they
would record that onto a cassette tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gen one, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you did it again as gen two,
you can hear the sound quality diff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear the difference between gen
one and gen two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would put gen one,
gen two, you know, however many gens it
[SPEAKER_02]: was from the digital recording,
we would put that on the tape and we
[SPEAKER_02]: would, uh, you know, put that on tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the listener would know what the
quality is that they're listening to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of relate to that in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the data is still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the information, the genetic
information is still there, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: further away you get from gen zero,
no matter what it also, of course it has
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with how clean your spaces,
how clean your practices are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are always going to be in,
in play, but it's going to pick up things
[SPEAKER_02]: along the way no matter what, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you think about like the chem dog,
I've had it for 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about that, how much crap
has the chem dog picked up along the way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 30 years is a long time,
but then you hit the reset button.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so tomorrow with the, with the,
the gen zero clone that you get from the
[SPEAKER_02]: grateful head, now you started off your 30
years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Potentially 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have a whole, we already know
what 30 years can do the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we love it so much and so much times,
but we can't, we can't say for sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's changed a whole bunch since day one,
but we know it has, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like hitting the reset button.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just erase all that time in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's literally just that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I wouldn't say you have to do
anything special.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing special you have to do is
follow the SOP and the instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a nice little video.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have the information that
comes with your clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to beat you in the head with
it just cause we want to make sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: have success.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sold, you know, I've been around
people who've sold clones a lot and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen some of the issues that come up with
just traditional clones being shipped and
[SPEAKER_02]: provided to people on mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's like, you have to be
aware, like when you're been doing this as
[SPEAKER_02]: long as I've been doing it, there's a lot
of things you just don't think about that
[SPEAKER_02]: a person who hasn't been doing this long
comes across, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just things that are second nature to
me, like things that are obvious,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're only obvious to me
because I've been doing it for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so someone who hasn't, they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just trying to make sure that all
the things that should be obvious to you
[SPEAKER_02]: will be, you know, part of your plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you receive your clone and want to go
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's just a matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically think of it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a rooted clone, but you're going
to treat it like it's an unrooted clone
[SPEAKER_02]: for seven to seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to acclimate it slowly over
seven to 10 days, even though it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also, you know, you can also treat
it with trichoderma and other beneficials
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of inoculate its own immune
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out, they don't really have an
immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have to acclimate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can speed the process up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have the instructions in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you know, put some basics,
you know, stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it in a grow store,
sometimes at a hardware store to inoculate
[SPEAKER_02]: the root zone to kind of defend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the theory with inoculation is
if you occupy the state, the space with
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial, you know, fungi, bacteria,
then that's a space that a pathogen that's
[SPEAKER_02]: detrimental can exist in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even on that basic level right there,
you know, we can, we have ways that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are partially acclimated,
which is beneficial and you'll have about
[SPEAKER_02]: seven or 10 days where you have to keep
high humidity, low light, low EC feeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of observation, you know,
but that's your baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it shouldn't be no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to give you step-by-step
instructions and lots of support along the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like as a follow-up,
it's a sort of a similar question in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way, but maybe a bit more of a real issue
where someone added a follow-up to that
[SPEAKER_01]: first fan question, which was,
do you also need to be wary of popping new
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds in your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know, like a hoplite and virus
can be transmitted via seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think again, you need to be careful
of that if you're going to try to start
[SPEAKER_01]: clean with these clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think you need to do
anything different, you know, than your
[SPEAKER_02]: normal protocol when you're avoiding that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you pop seeds, seeds have,
there's still, the data is still out on
[SPEAKER_02]: hoplite and viral transmission of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly can be transmitted,
but we, you know, we don't have a,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have an actual study yet that we
can refer to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the numbers range between,
you know, 8% to 40%, I think is the latest
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of transmission on seeds,
depending on if it was the mother or the
[SPEAKER_02]: father.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if it was the mother, I'm just,
I may not be correct about all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's not all in concrete yet,
but I understand that if the mother's
[SPEAKER_02]: infected, the higher, it's a higher rate
of transmission than if the father was
[SPEAKER_02]: infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, more than likely, you know,
just, you know, of course the mother would
[SPEAKER_02]: be the one that's more likely infected
than the father, but that doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that people who are
conscious of hoplite and viral and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: damage are already careful with their
seedlings, you know, making sure they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not possibly transmitting anything that
was on those seeds until they can get it
[SPEAKER_02]: to testing, which, you know, you can do as
soon as you have roots nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have to wait till we have truly
leaves with petioles and then we could,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, take the petioles and then test
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we don't even test the petioles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're testing the roots now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that if a seedling had hoplite
and viroid, you know, in transmission when
[SPEAKER_02]: it was created, I think that you,
as soon as you have roots, you could find
[SPEAKER_02]: that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were concerned about popping seeds
and hoplite and viroid, as long as you
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that you can test that seedling
pretty early on, I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: much concern there, you know, as long as
you're willing to follow your protocols.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have them, if not, you need them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, you know, that's bleaching
your material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, bleaching your tools, scissors,
pruning scissors, bleaching your hands,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% minimum for a minimum of 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you keep your scissors in your bleach
water, 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do like 15% just to give it a
little extra, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can go up to 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the contact time of 60 seconds is
crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another thing that I've noticed a
lot of people have not been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: privy to yet is the runoff water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wanna make sure that you're not
sharing water from one plantlet to the
[SPEAKER_02]: other, regardless if it's a seedling,
a clone, you know, plants, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: matter if you think, I mean, not even if
you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't want water from one plant's
runoff exposed to another plant's root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're cloning, that can be
challenging if you have multiple strains
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you have seedlings and, you know,
seedling trays, same thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that presents a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one trick I've learned I should throw
out there is, you know, those Grodan,
[SPEAKER_02]: taller orange, they use the AOK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you have those there,
but anyone in the United States is gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: They rise up above the seedling flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they keep them separated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you space them out every other cell
you'll use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not a bulletproof,
you know, solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing to do is to keep each plant
in its own tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not always the, you know,
even here at the facility, we have
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains in our single tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when you water them, you know,
we used to like just flood the trays with
[SPEAKER_02]: water, easy enough, drain it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't wanna do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's been years since I've done
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been years since I've had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that easy way of watering my
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do now is you can take a turkey
baster and water each one individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of this takes more time,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I've learned is you can take
that tray out and I'll put it like on a
[SPEAKER_02]: metal wire rack over a sink or some other
kind of catch pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll water it from top down with
a dram seed waterer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like a shower head, but a really
small one meant for seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's less pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll just do a top down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the runoff just goes right into the
vessel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a quick way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use a lot more nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, you know, it's a lot cheaper than
remediating for hoplite and viroid or even
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with the nightmare of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a trick I've learned that I can
share.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as what you're asking your
listener asked about the seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think there's anything
special you need to do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just you always want to have the
protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to always act like you have
hoplite and viroid, even if you are pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: sure you don't, because you're never 100
percent sure you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can show up in plants weeks after
you've tested, you know, like you can test
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can test a plant hoplite and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be, you know, plants can outgrow
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tricky thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not something you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something you can, you know,
have any kind of sense of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to assume it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't see it, but you're not going to
go touch that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to treat it the same
way you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to develop your protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll be happy to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something I always think I remind
myself I should do is kind of make one for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so, you know, I don't think there's
anything special about seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do anything special,
you know, just I guess the reason I say
[SPEAKER_02]: that is because you should already be
doing whatever it is that you have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep your space clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you want the best chance for
success, you know, like use bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be on top of it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, I got one more question before
we jump into some of the final ones before
[SPEAKER_01]: we wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a good question,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our listeners wanted to know,
do you have any predictions on how the
[SPEAKER_01]: launch of the Great Fourhead might affect
the seed market?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I myself thought, you know,
some people might have a knee jerk
[SPEAKER_01]: response and think, oh, everyone will be
able to do their own TK cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think the opposite is true as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone now has access to a super rare
Malawi that they maybe otherwise couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could get some really unique
offerings coming out because people have
[SPEAKER_01]: such a greater access to genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you thought about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any predictions?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, as you know, I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, one of the things that I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have thought about it a lot even
before the Great Fourhead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we've all seen this trend
of more and more clones becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: available, maybe because of the hemp,
the Farm Bill Act allowing plants to not
[SPEAKER_02]: be cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's hemp because there's no THC in
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clone onlys have been, you know,
I've seen the trend where more and more of
[SPEAKER_02]: them are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying earlier, the thing is,
is, you know, how are the producers doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they, you know, are they selecting
things to produce that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're supposed to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are they, are they using clean
practices, you know, to make sure they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not, you know, it's a big responsibility
to start selling live plants to people
[SPEAKER_02]: because you could potentially wreck their
world with a disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could, you could really mess
things up for humans and for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: regions of fucking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have thought about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that the availability of
clones has definitely affected seed sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen, I've seen a few breeders kind
of a closing up shop, I believe recently
[SPEAKER_02]: in the last few weeks, you know,
I can't say that it's related,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I assume it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on a larger, on a larger picture,
I'd say that it's actually going to help
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, breeding is not
centralized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, there's not, it's not Coke and
Pepsi, you know, breeding is, is vast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, anybody can create amazing fucking
shit and we see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see people all the time come out of the
woodwork with amazing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, genetics to sell in seed form,
things that they've created, things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's going to be more of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the Grateful Head is going to
further decentralize genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only in clone onlys that we offer,
but also the creations that come from
[SPEAKER_02]: people being able to obtain clone onlys
that were previously unobtainable for
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you know, that were unavailable to
them for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've thought about this a lot and I
really do think that it's going to open up
[SPEAKER_02]: the doors to, I mean, I'm sure there's
going to be a lot of people who breed and
[SPEAKER_02]: sell seeds who are going to, you know,
wish that this kind of thing wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: happening, but it's one of those things
where, you know, the writing's already on
[SPEAKER_02]: the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't put it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we're going.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the next evolution in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, five, six, seven, eight years
ago, you know, people weren't sending
[SPEAKER_02]: clones like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's, you know, you turn on
Facebook or you turn, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram or even Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't go on Facebook,
but I had a friend I had to wish happy
[SPEAKER_02]: birthday and I went on there and I was
bombarded with, you know, clone selling
[SPEAKER_02]: advertisements, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's becoming mainstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as far as breeding goes,
this is going to open up the door to more
[SPEAKER_02]: unique breeding projects because,
you know, from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I kind of apply it to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you may have smoked a cultivar that,
you know, a friend had or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled some weed that someone had or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, geez, you know,
that kind of gives me an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you took this and did that and
crossed this, that might be something
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was, that's the thing I'm
looking for that would make this project
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of, you know, in the back of
my head, like in my dreams, in the back of
[SPEAKER_02]: my dreams come to life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, to go get that cultivar or
to hunt it down, to be part, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it into your life, that could be a
process along with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that when you eliminate that
part and you can allow someone just to
[SPEAKER_02]: simply thumb through a library,
their creativity can get sparked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, like I said, I apply it to my
own way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's just going to open
up the door to more interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, we have, you know,
cannabis is, you know, is really kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like, you know,
we could use more variety, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems kind of weird to say that,
but honestly, even with all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars we have, there's really,
there's some, there's categories that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of dominate the space and they're not that
different, you know, and then even the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that the older schools, like the
chem stuff, like it's not that different
[SPEAKER_02]: from each other, you know, like I think
that it's going to kind of make a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: new categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that there's possible
that's going to make whole new categories
[SPEAKER_02]: of flavors out there, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that the guy, you know,
who's passionate about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's, you know, got the day job and he's
got the family to tend to, he's got the
[SPEAKER_02]: tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk to guys like this all the time,
selling seeds to them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I constantly am always emailing these
folks, answering their questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, to me, they're the ones that
have the most passion, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're the ones that have the most like,
you know, heart in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that they're the ones that are
going to bring us the next fucking amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's why we're trying to
keep a contact, a connection, a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with those fellas and ladies,
because they're the ones that are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring the next thing to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we want to help them show what
they do and what they're capable of and
[SPEAKER_02]: what they've done to the world,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think it's going to,
I think it's going to change the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: game, but not in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to turn the tables on
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pick just three clones for the
rest of your life from the Grateful Head
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to pick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me a second, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long list, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the Grateful Head collection,
you say, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want that swamp boys trying to
cushion my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Northern Lights, it's a Northern
Lights five, number one, Stone Fruit Red
[SPEAKER_02]: Fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick to number two, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to go with that
Cheetos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I just, I, it's been a
minute and I want to, I want to see some
[SPEAKER_02]: of that cat piss stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's too much to pick three is hard,
but I'm going to say those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, next question is, have you had a
chance to taste chem dog after being
[SPEAKER_01]: through tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, there was another layer
that I, that I've been missing that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: missed over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was there, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that was a while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the inspirations to get
involved with, you know, my own library
[SPEAKER_02]: before all this stuff that's happening
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like, wow, this is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I've told you before, like I
started messing around with tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: in like 2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we had no idea the potential of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just didn't know in cannabis,
you know, and, um, and that's where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that, that's, uh, that, that,
that's kind of one of the inspirations
[SPEAKER_02]: that was like, man, this has gotta happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's something more here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I first started this,
like I never, when I first dabbled into
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue, I didn't even consider,
you know, all the benefits to the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: health, you know, it seemed to me more of
a way of a storing, transporting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, simple shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, stuff that it's really nothing
to do with, you know, um, tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: has been around for over a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, every banana you eat comes from tissue
culture, lots of the fruits you eat,
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries, you know, all these things
are propagated orchids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot more and more things are being,
you know, house plants, all house plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are, you know, it's just a really
efficient way of propagating at the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then more advanced, there's a way,
you know, a lot of the plants don't it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessary to keep them around forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, you know, I don't know
about bananas and strawberries and such,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you could probably replace a lot of
those things if you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cannabis isn't like that, you know,
there's certain cultivars that you cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: replace and well, none of them you can
really replace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the ones we love anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I discovered like the vigor,
the, the, the, the flavor coming back,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all that stuff, the aroma,
you know, and Kim dog was the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: turned me on to that, of course,
because I have the most experience in my
[SPEAKER_02]: life with Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my mind's memory, I have a timeline
of, you know, whether I can perceive it at
[SPEAKER_02]: any given moment doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there of like where we started out,
what we fell in love with and what we're,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we have now, you know, so when I
experienced that, you know, the vigor of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of a plant that came out of tissue
culture, Ben cleaned up in such a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was night and day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's, it's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, you can't deny it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unreal, you know, and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a time machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like going back in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a miracle, you know, like you
can't do that with humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that with animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You certainly can do with plants and
that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a beautiful and powerful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final question for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are people able to get in on this
drop?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd need to check the site daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a firm date?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can check with any of our Instagram
accounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make sure that we're,
the announcements will happen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So skunk underscore VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have at the grateful debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me start over at the grateful head
LLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our Instagram page for the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check on Kevin's, you can catch
Kevin Joe Dries Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check on Dutch blooms,
Dutch underscore blooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it is we'll make the
announcement, you know, in a uniform way
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's time, when we will make the
announcement, when we have the list to
[SPEAKER_02]: look forward to, we don't kind of,
we're not going to just drop the list on
[SPEAKER_02]: people the day it needs to go up for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to give you enough time to kind of
thumb through the list and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: make your plans to make sure you don't
miss out or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, sometime at the end of this month,
um, we'll make an announcement about when
[SPEAKER_02]: the sale will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clones are all in the, uh,
um, the production part is going smoothly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the part now where we have roots
and we're beginning to do acclimation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you want to get them to a
certain size where they can ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not, we're not going to be seeing
you like little tiny plantless.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people when asking me that
question, um, I'm getting that a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they've gotten tissue culture
plants as a little tiny like sprig of a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: These won't be like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are going to be more substantial,
like clone type plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, tissue culture plants are coming from
vitro sterile conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not exactly, like a traditional
clone, but they're going to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: substantial than a lot of times what
people have seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we're on track and we're not going
to say a date because these are plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that we don't stay in
a timeline where we stick more to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, you know, the needs of what the
plants need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I think in the next two weeks,
I don't want to overstep my, my boundary
[SPEAKER_02]: here, but I think in the next two weeks,
we'll be announcing the list as we get the
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers counted in and then, and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: August 5th is still our target date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then it'll be about a two week
period, uh, before the plants are no
[SPEAKER_02]: longer viable for sale anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is incredible, both in practicality
and in the excitement sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of it for everything we were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: chat about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any comments or shout outs you wanted to
make?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I have anything,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, I'm really glad to be back with you
and congratulations on your life and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happening and you know, can't wait to
release these clones, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been so excited about something
for as long as I can remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's palpable and look, it's, it's
something that's going to be a game
[SPEAKER_01]: changer for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure as it evolves, we'll see the,
uh, the full, the full extent of it all.
