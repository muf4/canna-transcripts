[SPEAKER_05]: origins TK for coming on the show today
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, look it all good things come they
just take a bit of time I'm grateful to
[SPEAKER_05]: have you on the show today The first thing
I wanted to ask you as we've been asking
[SPEAKER_05]: all guests recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you been smoking on lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have trying to push and if you
push obviously around Lately, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: going through some new flavors here at the
legal grow that I'm working at something I
[SPEAKER_01]: may proceed But the most recent thing I've
been smoking on enjoying is actually some
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian gold Panama red that a friend of
mine gave me a little jar of and Actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: it brings back super good memories from
this strand of Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the early 2000s called juicy fruit
Which I always thought was the Thai
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani cross I want to say but whatever
is in this particular But has that exact
[SPEAKER_01]: same like turps and aroma if you smoke it
this leaves that slingery smell in the air
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it looks like it too has very
orange hairs on top of the green flower a
[SPEAKER_01]: little spindly sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it has a very similar look So I
didn't enjoy that That also answer the
[SPEAKER_01]: question you ask people about the cheapest
Yeah, I love that Is that the um,
[SPEAKER_05]: the Lambo you posted?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's beautiful did you get a chance to
try much of those like Mexican and South
[SPEAKER_01]: American sativa's growing up As far as the
Mexican goes not for say like in South
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida, there's so much brick we've ever
come to Florida for some reason I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all a lot of my friends were like
moving truck loads that stuff I have
[SPEAKER_01]: friends who made 50 60 grand pop doing
like one deal with like much messy break
[SPEAKER_01]: and Like I said, I could barely even sell
a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had too much less the power more We
smoked it early early on as kids here in
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's nothing else around but
definitely wasn't my favorite You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know obviously there's some good one
that came from parts of Mexico but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing like these Colombian As far as
Asian back then as a kid when I first
[SPEAKER_01]: moved to Papua I had a group of friends
and we would actually pitch in Once in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while to buy like an ounce between us from
this guy that had a connection and he
[SPEAKER_01]: called it Hawaiian Haze or no,
sorry Hawaiian scum and it was just some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the stinkiest but ever and it's super
fluffy but fill a giant bag and the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: that would go get it the guy that's on it
lives in a high-rise condominium building
[SPEAKER_01]: full of old people and the people the guy
that we knew it was older than us but he
[SPEAKER_01]: knew the guy and go over there get an
ounce but like this is back before seal
[SPEAKER_01]: meals or jars were being used so he would
always come back with like a lick seal bag
[SPEAKER_01]: or like this big fluffy ounce and the
stories were always about some old people
[SPEAKER_01]: that get in the elevators with them and
just get these crazy looks and Probably
[SPEAKER_01]: over a year or so after that connection
basically I think the guy got kicked out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the condo or maybe he got busted or
something so that was we lost that
[SPEAKER_01]: connection but that was a that was
definitely some sort of sativa hazy type
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like really really funky and
different and lots of colors One of my
[SPEAKER_01]: good friends of this day actually Angelo
he's filled by Sea Green Lounge on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram he was one of the ones that
would pitch in on that stuff with me when
[SPEAKER_01]: we were probably like 14 15 15 years old
I'd say yeah super young oh epic what was
[SPEAKER_02]: the effect like of that Hawaiian skunk
well it's been many years but uh obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: um I just remember it was to this day I
would say is in the top 10 weed we've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever smoked um varieties wise I don't
know uh I can't say exactly what the buzz
[SPEAKER_01]: was like but I'm pretty sure we all loved
it a lot and you know it was like as kids
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just like some of the best stuff
we'd ever seen and still this day like I
[SPEAKER_01]: said if I had a bag of that stuff people
would be like what the hell is that um it
[SPEAKER_01]: was really exotic and I have no clue if it
was actually Hawaiian or whatever it was
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what it was called uh epic epic let
me um let me take you back for a moment
[SPEAKER_05]: because you you referenced you know you've
always got some TK you got some OG Kush on
[SPEAKER_05]: hand that's uh exactly what I imagined I
wanted to ask you do you have a favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the two um on any given day not
really I pretty much smoke them equally I
[SPEAKER_01]: used pretty much a bong hit person so I
was doing bong hits one after the other
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically I never really choose one a
day it's pretty much mixing stuff up like
[SPEAKER_01]: a salad all day long I got seven or eight
different varieties and pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking through on a regular basis um as
far as triangle I'm a lot more familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with that because that's the one that I've
had the cup that me and frag and my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends have had for years um and the OG
Kush I only found out about five years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: when I went public and then met Josh and a
bunch of people that were you know
[SPEAKER_01]: involved with the OG Kush and that's when
we kind of tied all those stories together
[SPEAKER_01]: but um uh yeah they're on their day
they're pretty equal um the triangle seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a little bit more finicky these days
than it used to be like I used to always
[SPEAKER_01]: pop we used to use 600 watt lights back
when I was growing it mostly and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if it just like like less light like
it does um but once you get under
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands it just seemed like it's a
little bit harder to get it you know to
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's perfectly tasty and where we
used to always get it um so yeah I would
[SPEAKER_01]: say the triangle I had to pick one because
like I said it got like a lot of hard time
[SPEAKER_01]: with her and OG Kush I've only had her for
like five years so wow there's a there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot to go into there the first one I want
to touch on I've seen a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: posting recently about how they feel OG
comes out way better under hps than led
[SPEAKER_01]: has this been your experience absolutely
um it's been definitely tricky with the
[SPEAKER_01]: leds uh like back you know when I first
started I learned using checkerboard back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day we used to use hps and allied
um so sodium and allied sorry and uh we do
[SPEAKER_01]: a checkerboard setup so actually where I'm
at now doing stuff they have a few rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: that are checkerboarded and that seems to
be some of the best quality in the
[SPEAKER_01]: building I believe anyway as far as leds
go um you can get super beautiful looking
[SPEAKER_01]: nugs but there's just a little something
that's missing um and like it really you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to really validate and I've had a
couple batches that come out super good
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not consistent it's like you know
like one out of three will come out where
[SPEAKER_01]: you want it so it's definitely something
to do with the leds that's missing still
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe something to do with like a little
uv light or some uv light that's missing
[SPEAKER_01]: from the leds still I know some companies
are throwing bars in now and adding that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff so we'll see if it progresses more
and they get better and I've also seen
[SPEAKER_01]: some really good batches come out you know
when they do come out good other leds they
[SPEAKER_01]: do come out good so it's definitely
possible um it's just for some reason it's
[SPEAKER_05]: more consistent than an hps yeah
interesting okay certainly a sentiment
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard echoed by a few people so
that's that's something I'll have to take
[SPEAKER_05]: in I wanted to quickly ask because you
mentioned that you know the tk is a little
[SPEAKER_05]: more finicky now than before and on past
episodes we've discussed in detail how the
[SPEAKER_05]: same is said quite a lot about the chem
dog I wonder have you seen any other like
[SPEAKER_05]: the common thing with the chem dog we hear
is like it takes longer to root the flavor
[SPEAKER_05]: is not as strong anymore it's a little
less vigorous would you say that you see
[SPEAKER_01]: those same sort of reductions or is it a
couple batches come out of this grow with
[SPEAKER_01]: the hps recently that like went way back
and tasted that way they should and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: so we've had a couple tests that uh you
know we never did lab testing back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day of now we're hunting lab testing on
these things and we've ran between 19 THC
[SPEAKER_01]: to 32 THC you know depending on how good
the batch come out and uh so yeah I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen that hit 32 actually recently and
that was one of the tastier ones we've had
[SPEAKER_01]: yet for some reason you know the rooms we
have are pretty much are all a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different one room with produce better
than the other we have two leds there's uh
[SPEAKER_01]: there's 11 rooms total to grow on that now
and uh out of those 11 there's two leds
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the rest are hps but then some
have checkerboard with um halide and some
[SPEAKER_01]: are just all hps so each room has its own
little personality I guess you could say
[SPEAKER_01]: so some of the rooms definitely put off
more fire than others um and since I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been there basically it's been almost a
almost a year now I was working with these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys here in Florida and we had a
hurricane Ian came through last year and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was right about before I got to launch
my brand and uh basically it wiped out
[SPEAKER_01]: power and flooded the entire zone and
wiped out the entire coastline where the
[SPEAKER_01]: storm hit and it basically I went right
over the grove we were at and power went
[SPEAKER_01]: out the cameras went out the backup
generators went out and so nobody can get
[SPEAKER_01]: to the place for three days so that
definitely set the whole building into a
[SPEAKER_01]: tailspin and a lot of stuff had to get
killed actually funny because most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: moms um from the west coast that they had
all the genetic from the west coast
[SPEAKER_01]: actually at our time with the power being
offered a day or two but some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought from the east coast like tk and
og for example were they actually survived
[SPEAKER_01]: the power outage like no problem but most
of the babies that we had going that were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting ready to go and flower with my
brand whatever they pretty much all died
[SPEAKER_01]: and we had to reset everything it took
another six months to get up and going
[SPEAKER_05]: actually what a what an incredible
testament to the the power of the tk and
[SPEAKER_05]: the og that's cool okay so I um I wanted
to ask while we're on the topic what style
[SPEAKER_01]: of growing do you do well I've always been
uh more of a salt grower because here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida we're always indoor I mean we
didn't really have the luxury like
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone out west does of growing outdoors
because first off the humidity second of
[SPEAKER_01]: all back in the day they had drones and
they had clear helicopters and they'd gone
[SPEAKER_01]: you know do like sweeps with their
helicopters and finally every single plant
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors they could you know it seemed
like every plant that would be outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: would get found I don't know how they did
it but I tried a few times and some
[SPEAKER_01]: patches here and there and like we would
crawl through hedges and bushes and put
[SPEAKER_01]: little plants in the ground we'd come back
a couple days later and there'd be a tc
[SPEAKER_01]: tracks and we'd go you know quadro
interface right to the spot where they
[SPEAKER_01]: were and they would cut them down before
they were growing so we never had a chance
[SPEAKER_01]: in outdoor basically I was saying um I've
had a couple batches here and there the
[SPEAKER_01]: central america outdoor but just like
experimental and like five gallon pots and
[SPEAKER_01]: so on so my whole life has pretty much
been indoor with hydro and this as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor I prefer salts obviously that I've
tried just actually I'm smoking I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying it right now there's can't be more
organic a lot of which I'm enjoying so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably use that again in the future
but yeah we've always that's basically how
[SPEAKER_01]: I learn and that's basically better for
indoors I always learn as far as like
[SPEAKER_01]: living in soil and stuff you know that's
more I always thought it was more for
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe in a bed or if you're growing you
know big greenhouse or outdoor plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: like giant containers where you know the
living soil actually starts living and
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits from everything you're doing to
it versus you know an indoor situation
[SPEAKER_01]: you're usually growing a small pot so yeah
we've always been I've done rock wool I've
[SPEAKER_01]: done cocoa I've done clay pellets that's
basically how I learned years ago and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know lots of different nutrient brands
over the years and we've always produced
[SPEAKER_01]: fire weed I smoke it myself all the time
so yeah happy with it what an epic answer
[SPEAKER_05]: and massive shout out to Organics Alive
one of our sponsors that's so cool to hear
[SPEAKER_05]: you're growing a batch and smoking it it's
good yeah it's a group of surfers too so
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually met with a couple of them and
actually at the animal cup this last year
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and met with Eric from Organics
Alive he's a super cool guy and we plan on
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out again soon once it comes to
Florida so definitely good hookup that's
[SPEAKER_05]: epic yeah my interactions with Eric have
been really awesome as well I wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly ask for our listeners out there
you got any tips for growing the TK or the
[SPEAKER_05]: OG I think in the past I've heard a lot of
people say like whatever cow mag you'd
[SPEAKER_05]: normally use like double or triple it when
you grow in an OG what's your take any
[SPEAKER_01]: tips for the listeners well me personally
when I was growing my best TK ever back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day we were being as simple as can be
and I wasn't really adding any cow mag
[SPEAKER_01]: this was honestly 600 watt sodiums I was
using flood and drain tables this is for a
[SPEAKER_01]: year that is probably 10 years and we had
the same brand I learned on actually was a
[SPEAKER_01]: two-part liquid called Rockwell formula
one and they stopped making it years ago I
[SPEAKER_01]: think Sunlight Supply bought the company
out and then they changed the formula and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was never the same again and then they
just got faded out but that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned on basically all the way back in
like 1990-91 and I used that stuff all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way till I got in trouble in 2011 so I
know the company has gone away since then
[SPEAKER_01]: but that was the two-part I never had any
I mean basically I would find you know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all these like snake oils I just
called them you know at the hydro stores
[SPEAKER_01]: that were $50 a bottle for this that and
the other and I tried a few things here
[SPEAKER_01]: and there but swell and you know the
different products cool bloom and
[SPEAKER_01]: different botanic airs and different
additives but I always had the best
[SPEAKER_01]: results from just being simple with it I
thought you know like just the two-part
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient the right pH and just that 600
watt lights which they seem to love and in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida we always grew you know my style
growing was always like in a house and
[SPEAKER_01]: bedrooms or a garage where you didn't
really have the luxury of having mass AC
[SPEAKER_01]: systems added you know unless you install
yourself so a lot of time you just run
[SPEAKER_01]: your central AC unit so your house could
only get so cold your veterans can only
[SPEAKER_01]: get so cold unless you had AC but a lot of
times I would do like two or three lights
[SPEAKER_01]: per room and you're going to get you know
your your house as cold as you're living
[SPEAKER_01]: in it so it seemed like the best patches
obviously for years are always in the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter months in Florida because it would
actually get pretty chilly in Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: especially central Florida getting the 40s
and 50s at times sometimes even lower so
[SPEAKER_01]: those nights that time of year for
whatever reason TK always thrived and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like when the tastiest stickiest bank
dispatches would always come out in summer
[SPEAKER_01]: months you get bigger plants obviously a
little bit warmer and they just never
[SPEAKER_01]: taste as good sometimes it'd be a little
more bland or almost like cardboardy you
[SPEAKER_01]: could just almost tell it was just like
you know it took time but over time we
[SPEAKER_01]: just realized that it was they like the
cooler temperatures and I started adding
[SPEAKER_01]: in many splits and smaller like window
units in my room and it really set it off
[SPEAKER_01]: like year-round where it was always good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard about it growing in ultra
cold conditions have you ever got the TK
[SPEAKER_05]: to go purple or is it just pretty much a
green plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the leaves maybe turn dark but
like I've seen I give it to a friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine and Michigan who actually grew it
last year and I guess it gets super cold
[SPEAKER_01]: up there obviously I don't know how cold
his room got but it looked as dark as I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever seen it but down here no we always
had it it was always green for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part like you might get some coloring on
the leaves during the winter months I was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about when it got cold enough you
get your room down to like 55 or 60 some
[SPEAKER_01]: times if you tried and you know basically
the lights on it would be that cold but at
[SPEAKER_01]: night and that's when you wanted to have
it really cold back then it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever combination we used to do in
the winter months here it just made that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff taste like magic it's some of the
best we'd ever and I've tried it warm I
[SPEAKER_01]: tried it cold I tried it you know all
different ranges but like it definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: liked it cooler not cold cold and it
definitely likes some warmth in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning to get going obviously you know
like that's what we thought style we do it
[SPEAKER_01]: now get it growing for like the first
month kind of warm especially LEDs you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to have some warmth up to like 84 85
degrees even on the LEDs but after the way
[SPEAKER_01]: you know halfway through we pretty much
start dropping it down I would anyway all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way down probably likes say 70 for
daytime 10 high and 60 to 65 for nighttime
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a good target and that always
seems to be a magic formula for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah okay beautiful and out of curiosity
what's like the single most memorable
[SPEAKER_05]: batch of TK you've had and do you remember
how it was grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well like I was saying most of the time I
grew it I was using clay rocks and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: flood and drain and then at some point I
switched over to drippers and it just made
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants a lot thicker and just blew up
actually so I kind of like got out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole flood and drain thing and switched
the drippers at that point and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: started learning a little bit more about
prop steering and drying them out a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more at the end and it seemed like
there were some batches that were just
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible from that there's a couple of
times timers went out and the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: almost died on the stick and they just
ended up being like oh my god why haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: they got so good so that's about the time
you started learning you know how to like
[SPEAKER_01]: start your plants and basically help bring
out more flavors and oils and and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the cooler temperatures combined basically
was a nice combination for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's beautiful that's beautiful I want
to talk more because you mentioned some
[SPEAKER_05]: seed projects a few questions ago but
before we get there let's go back and set
[SPEAKER_05]: the scene because I know everyone who's
listening is really keen to hear exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: what your name is TK Origins so let's go
back to the start what was your first
[SPEAKER_05]: experience with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: First experience was I think I was 12
years old like 1984 my parents had split
[SPEAKER_01]: up and my dad moved to a nice house on the
beach he rented like a few hours north
[SPEAKER_01]: actually in Bugworth town and my brother
and I were still living on my mother's
[SPEAKER_01]: house and we go visit him on the weekends
and he apparently smoked a lot I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know then but that trip one of these trips
at his house basically I was being nosy
[SPEAKER_01]: and him and my brother were out for the
day I guess or doing something and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going through my dad's room and I stumbled
across a change basket on top of his
[SPEAKER_01]: dresser and on top of there was this huge
roach plant in a roach clip device like
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those metal clamps so I knew for
some reason what it was I guess I was in
[SPEAKER_01]: seventh grade at the time and just knew
what it was I knew it was drugs you know
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't think it was I wasn't scared
of it but whatever for whatever reason
[SPEAKER_01]: that day I found a lighter and got curious
and I took it out back on our patio and
[SPEAKER_01]: took a little hit off it put it out right
away all paranoid immediately and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually worried immediately like I was
gonna get seen by the neighbors the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors gonna smell it it was the smell
of the house my dad was gonna see that I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked some of it so it just hit me
immediately paranoia style and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: see weed again for another year until
ninth grade okay and and what was that
[SPEAKER_01]: next experience like we moved down my dad
and he was running houses every year
[SPEAKER_01]: movements from school to school so my
grade I went to this real nice high school
[SPEAKER_01]: that was full of surfers and skaters and
like all my type of people basically and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was I had just started surfing here
before in eighth grade in Boynton Beach
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I started going to this new school
and met a bunch of friends and they all
[SPEAKER_01]: had brothers a little older than them they
were all smoking weed already and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically I just kind of ran into it that
way again parties or go to like a football
[SPEAKER_01]: game with some of the guys at the school
and smoke under the bleachers and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that we all skated started getting
the skating at the time and go to skate
[SPEAKER_01]: parks and built little half pipes in our
yards and the whole scene of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: all in the smoking weed at the time so
that's basically when I got into it and do
[SPEAKER_05]: you remember were there any names
associated with the strain back then or
[SPEAKER_05]: was it just like the days where it was
like the kind and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting interesting and you've touched
on the surfing aspect and this was
[SPEAKER_05]: something I wanted to talk to you about
because much like the Grateful Dead I feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like surfing in general is very
intertwined with cannabis culture was it
[SPEAKER_05]: is it one of the cases with the chicken
and the egg like which one came first for
[SPEAKER_05]: you the cannabis or the surfing or was it
sort of at the same time no I started
[SPEAKER_01]: surfing that year before like I said it
was eighth grade I bought my first
[SPEAKER_01]: surfboard at a pawn shop and I live like
maybe a mile from the beach in Boynton
[SPEAKER_01]: Beach so I started going there all the
time on the weekends and my dad was always
[SPEAKER_01]: against me surfing and he always knew that
it was like a stoner type sport you know
[SPEAKER_01]: just maybe because of the fast times
movies or whatever it was but he just
[SPEAKER_01]: always browned out at first for years
actually so I almost like how to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: like secretly I'd go to the beach you know
my surfboard type thing so yeah it was
[SPEAKER_01]: surfing first skating next and then
smoking weed pretty much came next after
[SPEAKER_05]: that the the holy trio I love it so
skating smoking yeah no it is interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: because obviously you know like there's
that history of like the brothers of
[SPEAKER_05]: eternal love and their connection with
surfing so it is I guess maybe that's
[SPEAKER_05]: partly where your dad got his perception
of it from maybe it could be he just
[SPEAKER_01]: always wanted me to be a sports player
like you know like either baseball or
[SPEAKER_01]: something soccer whatever it was he had me
playing baseball real young stuff I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do basically and he's always on
the TV watching sports growing up which
[SPEAKER_01]: actually got me to not like this kind of
sports too much so that's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: actually led me to surfing and skating to
begin with there you go right we tend to
[SPEAKER_05]: rebel from our parents that's that's the
that's pretty part for the course so from
[SPEAKER_05]: that second experience when did the penny
drop for you that cannabis was something
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanted to get really involved with
well let's see ninth grade I was just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of I wasn't buying everything yet these
guys always had it you know so we would
[SPEAKER_01]: get high with them but we moved my dad
finally bought a house for 10th grade but
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like an hour south of there 45
minutes out there so we moved from like I
[SPEAKER_01]: said all over the place and I finally get
settled in he must friends and they moved
[SPEAKER_01]: me to another place like south of there
which the way he's run is good at the
[SPEAKER_01]: school I was supposed to go to is all
super nice and new so that's the reason he
[SPEAKER_01]: bought the house and then we moved there
for the summer and they closed that school
[SPEAKER_01]: down so the next thing you know I'm
getting shipped to like this crazy public
[SPEAKER_01]: school in the middle of a real bad
neighborhood wasn't liking it one bit
[SPEAKER_01]: basically it was like small big up surfers
that I met you know in that first year and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically we lived close to the beach so I
like that part about it and he bought a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice house on the water actually so I
enjoyed that and I guess eventually I
[SPEAKER_01]: started making friends and stuff so anyway
that first year I met a bunch of kids
[SPEAKER_01]: skating surfing and that was part of the
year I started actually buying weed that
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually a group of friends I was
talking about earlier right we were buying
[SPEAKER_01]: that Hawaiian skunk from the guy and that
was actually before I was even driving a
[SPEAKER_01]: car yet so I was 15 and yeah that was the
year I first started buying and selling a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit of weed here and there
incredible so we just like sort of selling
[SPEAKER_05]: and middle manning it for a while before
you started growing or what was that
[SPEAKER_01]: progression like to then become a grower
yeah definitely started out just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like buying it for our personal and stuff
I never thought about growing it or seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: plants until years later but actually at
some point when I was I think I was 16 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 or 16 still someone had given me this
thing called a phototron and my dad had a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good moved in a pretty good-sized
house and the house was like divided in
[SPEAKER_01]: two and I had my own like room on the
other side of the house with my own
[SPEAKER_01]: entrance sliding out doors so I can kind
of come and go and sneak in and out house
[SPEAKER_01]: easy if I wanted and my dad was kind of
lenient wasn't very strict with us it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just me and my brother that lived with him
and he actually had a place going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: Acapulco he had a condo a couple friends
of his and he would go visit there all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time and leave my brother and I and leave
me in charge of the house basically so at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point somebody gave me a phototron
which was like this little octagon box
[SPEAKER_01]: that was like the size of a little mini
refrigerator and all the sides had these
[SPEAKER_01]: like tinted windows that you could lift up
or slide up and then access the center
[SPEAKER_01]: which had a bunch of these fluorescent
lights that were running up the center
[SPEAKER_01]: along the walls and I think someone gave
it to me because I had a fan that had
[SPEAKER_01]: broke on them or something and they didn't
want it anymore so I took it home and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck it in my little master closet and
covered it with like dirty laundry and a
[SPEAKER_01]: surfboard and stuff and actually popped
some seeds that I found on some bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that had no idea what it was but
basically got them going and flowered them
[SPEAKER_01]: out on that little thing actually did a
couple vouchers of it a couple of my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends I still talk to those day actually
will remember that it's super funny but
[SPEAKER_01]: never got caught pulled it off threw that
thing away at some point it was pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: much garbage oh man the phototron that's a
blast from the past I love to hear that
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's cool that you managed to do a
few crops from those seeds do you do you
[SPEAKER_05]: have any memories at all about like if you
had to guess based on the structure or the
[SPEAKER_05]: smells like looking back what do you think
those genetics might have been I really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't remember they're tiny plants they
probably you know they might have been
[SPEAKER_01]: like quarter ounces or something that came
out of there per plant if I might have
[SPEAKER_01]: done like three or four plants each batch
and you know just just it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: little hobby learning thing there's almost
like a if I see if I can get away with it
[SPEAKER_05]: here in my house in my house kind of thing
maybe look kudos to you that that's epic
[SPEAKER_05]: and you mentioned that you know the
property of Acapulco did you ever get to
[SPEAKER_01]: try any cool weed down there I never
actually been to Acapulco myself my dad
[SPEAKER_01]: was going down there all the time and he
would always that's probably the reason my
[SPEAKER_01]: parents separated I would imagine because
he was going on their party with his
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and my mom hated it so he would
always come back with like knockoff
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes for us my brother and I like Levi
jeans and this polo shirts and this that
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other so no I never actually spent
time in Acapulco I've been to Mexico three
[SPEAKER_01]: times different locations surfing but not
to Acapulco more recently actually I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been to southern Mexico which is probably
one of the better surfers my life there
[SPEAKER_05]: you go okay cool so you got into it pretty
early so you know how did things progress
[SPEAKER_05]: because for anyone who's been following
your story online they'd probably be aware
[SPEAKER_05]: that you were involved in the whole TK
story quite young you know sort of around
[SPEAKER_05]: 19 to 20s it sounds like it wasn't too
long of a time period before you
[SPEAKER_01]: transitioned into that story is that right
yeah well it all started actually going
[SPEAKER_01]: back a year I was 15 and I wasn't driving
yet and I was skipping school one day and
[SPEAKER_01]: we lived on like a dead-end street or my
dad had his own job or he'd come and go
[SPEAKER_01]: anytime he wanted so I never knew when
he'd back out of the driveway I'm supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be going to the bus stop but I've
always sneak out my surfboard and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: like run down the street where he wouldn't
see me and that's how I would skip school
[SPEAKER_01]: and get away with it so one day I'm
walking down the street my surfboard
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to like avoid my dad and I get to
the end of my street and my neighbor from
[SPEAKER_01]: across the street was a surfer also and he
was a little older than he was like 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years older than me and he pulled up his
little Mustang and asked me if I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to the beach with him I was like looked
and he had surfboards in the back I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like oh yeah so I jumped in and then that
day was basically the day that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: meet my whole crew later on that was like
the day that would change my life so we
[SPEAKER_01]: went to the beach that day a beach a
little further north that I don't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: many would go to because I lived in Papano
he took me to Deerfield beach was like the
[SPEAKER_01]: town north of there and there was a pier
there and basically a whole scene it was
[SPEAKER_01]: volleyball courts and chicks everywhere
and a bunch of surfers and the waves were
[SPEAKER_01]: good that day so this guy who's 10 years
older than me he starts to introduce me to
[SPEAKER_01]: his friends some of these guys were
actually pro surfers and surf for you know
[SPEAKER_01]: companies or whatever already sponsorships
and stuff and they had a video camera
[SPEAKER_01]: going on that day on the beach on a big
tripod so I'm hanging out with these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surfing myself and then basically at
some point I get asked if I wanted to run
[SPEAKER_01]: the camera for a while and video everybody
and he pointed out everybody here to video
[SPEAKER_01]: show me how to use the camera real quick
so I started messing with the camera and
[SPEAKER_01]: video and all these guys you know I was
like super young looking up to all these
[SPEAKER_01]: characters they're like 10 years older
than me at the time and I've already knew
[SPEAKER_01]: who some of these guys were I'm seeing
them surfing my local beach so that day we
[SPEAKER_01]: rallied a bunch of people up and went back
to this guy Tago Joe's house who was one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the guys that was surfing with us that
day they call him Tago Joe because he had
[SPEAKER_01]: a Mexican restaurant right there near the
beach called Tago Joe's so he ran by that
[SPEAKER_01]: name for years Miami mangoes actually
knows him really well there's actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: video of him and Miami mango fighting in a
boxing ring at a at a mic club years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: so anyway we get back to that guy's house
and I'm just a little young kid there
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone there walking around with bongs
and rolling up joints and fat you know fat
[SPEAKER_01]: guys that we can roll up joints with and
there's girls coming and going and bikinis
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a trampoline out back with a
pool and the guys got a pack of pitbulls
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like a big fat jeep and I'm like
oh that's it these guys are the shit so
[SPEAKER_01]: that day I met a couple other people that
I never seen before I met and basically I
[SPEAKER_01]: had already been buying weed at this point
so I started a conversation with one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the guys that was there that didn't surf
he was like one of the guys that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any sign he was like pale and he had
an English accent so we started talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about something I forget what it was about
but one thing led to another and he gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me his information if I ever wanted to get
a couple of ounces of weed here and there
[SPEAKER_01]: from him he said no worries so he hooked
me up so that's basically the person that
[SPEAKER_01]: met that day that would end up becoming my
mentor later on that same day at that
[SPEAKER_01]: place I met a few guys that were in there
you know being growers I would find out
[SPEAKER_01]: later on but I had no clue at the time
obviously Wow and and was it a pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: rapid transition into being involved in
their whole world or did it take some time
[SPEAKER_05]: to build some more rapport?
[SPEAKER_01]: No it took a little time for sure I think
like I said I was 15 then and just buying
[SPEAKER_01]: like an ounce here and there with some
friends I got a car shortly after that and
[SPEAKER_01]: started hooking up with the guy and got
buying maybe quarter pounds he was
[SPEAKER_01]: fronting to me at the time and like over
time a quarter pound will lead to a half
[SPEAKER_01]: pound and a half pound will lead to a
pound and it started to go stinky in my
[SPEAKER_01]: house and I was still living in my dad's
house so at that point in time I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: was around 17 I want to say I was still
living there and I had to go get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse little mini warehouse we called
a mini storage unit and I had to find one
[SPEAKER_01]: that power in it that I could put a little
refrigerator in and store the wheat in
[SPEAKER_01]: that was my whole goal so I found one did
that so I was able to buy a pound of time
[SPEAKER_01]: and not have to worry about my dad finding
it so yeah that's basically how I started
[SPEAKER_01]: ramping up these guys selling wheat for
them and at some point in time later on
[SPEAKER_01]: guess I was yeah middle 17ish I was asked
by the English guy if I wanted to go on a
[SPEAKER_01]: trip to Amsterdam and that's how that
thing came up basically he offered me he
[SPEAKER_01]: offered me to pay for everything to go
there with him and if I would carry sees
[SPEAKER_01]: that for him and the reason he asked me
that because I had already gone on a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of searches by then with some
friends and we've gone to Costa Rica
[SPEAKER_01]: Puerto Rico and a few other places by this
point I always carry we always carry weed
[SPEAKER_01]: down our pants back then because it was
before 9-11 and it was easy to travel with
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and it was basically like a
no-brainer and we did it like easily so I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess my friend was super paranoid so that
was the year I got asked to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam but before I could even go there
I had to ask my dad for permission and I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't tell I was going to Amsterdam
obviously because he probably said no in a
[SPEAKER_01]: heartbeat so I made up this whole story
about how I was going to visit my friends
[SPEAKER_01]: family in England and we're gonna go
skateboard some some of the streets maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: some skateboard parks there and do some
sightseeing and all the stuff and my dad
[SPEAKER_01]: let me like that no problem with it so and
back then there was no passports needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: travel over there I just all you need was
a person to get it so it was pretty easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to do so I think we went I definitely we
went like right before the holidays so I
[SPEAKER_01]: had like some school time off I want to
say and that was like my last year in
[SPEAKER_01]: school there and I was getting ready to
move out of this house soon anyway so it
[SPEAKER_01]: was pretty close to the end of me living
there so yeah that's when I went basically
[SPEAKER_05]: the first time so how old were you when
you went over what year was it 1989 the
[SPEAKER_01]: very end of 1989 so I was 17 still when I
got back from that trip that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: turned 1990 and I think then that year by
summertime I moved up so basically I when
[SPEAKER_01]: we got back from that trip I kind of
figured out that this guy was growing at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point along with a couple of people
that came on the trip with us so I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: had a feeling what was up I wasn't I
didn't see any at this point but I got
[SPEAKER_01]: home and started looking for a place to
move out to and I had this friend that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had surfing with all the time named Joe
and he was actually a couple years older
[SPEAKER_01]: than me and was one of the ones that was
actually buying some of the weed from me
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know I grew from like like I said
a quarter pound to half pound next thing
[SPEAKER_01]: you know he's buying a couple pounds at a
time and we were slinging a good amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed together so he had an apartment that
had an extra bedroom and he offered me a
[SPEAKER_01]: place to move in so I jumped on it and we
started living together and going out
[SPEAKER_01]: partying together and selling weed
together he had connections that would
[SPEAKER_01]: come from central Florida from like New
Smyrna Beach and Orlando area and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually how I met Craig because Craig
would drive down with this guy Mike Luke
[SPEAKER_01]: together like basically to buy as many
pounds they can get from us cash so we had
[SPEAKER_01]: a pretty good thing going for a while
until one day we came back home from I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what it was lunch or something
together and the apartment had gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: broken into him so he made it look like
basically I come to find out later on it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the guy Joe that set it all up but
I'll get back to that eventually so the
[SPEAKER_01]: house looked like it was robbed both rooms
got robbed they found four pounds that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had in my room and they found some cash
basically all I had that he made it look
[SPEAKER_01]: like they stole stuff out of his room too
so I believe you know it was like we got
[SPEAKER_01]: randomly robbed by somebody so we both
moved out I found my own place and because
[SPEAKER_01]: of that robbery though my friend that I
had been buying the weed cash at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point because I was getting better prices
for it and because of that robbery my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend felt bad for me and basically
offered me to come to his house one day
[SPEAKER_01]: which I did and took me for a ride and we
went to his grow which I had never seen
[SPEAKER_01]: before so that day walked into this nice
house in Boca Raton like I think it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: four bedroom three car garage two or three
car garage house and it was furnished
[SPEAKER_01]: super nice and set up like somebody lived
there but I could smell weed immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: when I walked in so I knew what was up and
he asked me if I wanted to be a helper on
[SPEAKER_01]: the next harvest trimming and manicuring
and cleaning up the bastard was about to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of this garage he showed me so
this was all like whoa you know like hit
[SPEAKER_01]: me like a ton of bricks I was like oh yeah
this is sick so I jumped on the offer he
[SPEAKER_01]: offered me I think like two or three
thousand dollars it was like be there for
[SPEAKER_01]: three days straight trimming with his then
stepbrother and his stepbrother's best
[SPEAKER_01]: friend who were like actually a year
younger than me so yeah that was around 18
[SPEAKER_01]: years old I guess when I got offered that
job and started doing that and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: basically every two months two or three
months I would go there for three days and
[SPEAKER_01]: make a couple grand and not only that but
I was also selling weed for the guy and
[SPEAKER_01]: making money off that and that's how
things started I mean and actually I
[SPEAKER_01]: started learning you know little things
about the house and he started teaching me
[SPEAKER_01]: about cloning and getting plants vegging
and mom plants and cleaning up and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: important stuff that you need to know so
yeah that was that all started around 18
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I think it was yeah turned 19 I
had my own place at this point and that
[SPEAKER_01]: same guy Joe was moved he moved back up to
central Florida where he was originally
[SPEAKER_01]: from but he was still coming down and
buying pounds and bringing cash so he can
[SPEAKER_01]: we set up something one day where I had
grabbed I think almost yeah it was ten
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds and I couldn't get to my warehouse
in time that day where I would normally
[SPEAKER_01]: start if I had to start or whatever
because they closed the gates at 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: they open up the six every day type thing
and I got there late so I had to take it
[SPEAKER_01]: to my apartment so the guy Joe gets there
he gets a hotel we go plan on going out
[SPEAKER_01]: that night he comes over my house and I
had the weed sitting in my refrigerator
[SPEAKER_01]: and a big seal mail bag and a garbage bag
and he didn't know it was there but he
[SPEAKER_01]: asked me for a beer at some point I didn't
think twice and I told him just grab one
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the fridge I should have grabbed it
myself thinking back but he's seeing the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in there and then we went out
drinking and on the way out I stopped at a
[SPEAKER_01]: gas station to get gas and he gets a page
from his girlfriend at the time blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: him up and he had this crazy chick so he
gets out of the car and goes and makes a
[SPEAKER_01]: phone call saying you know go talk to this
chick about something and shut her up so
[SPEAKER_01]: that basically he was off making
arrangements asked somebody to come in my
[SPEAKER_01]: place and rob it while we were out that
night so we go out drinking he has some
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that own some nightclub or he had
a friend that was like a bouncer at a
[SPEAKER_01]: nightclub and another friend that like was
a manager there or something so we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: connection to this nightclub we go to so
we come back like three four in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning pretty late night all drunk and he
comes in my house where he would normally
[SPEAKER_01]: come in and at least come in and smoke a
joint or do some bondgates with me before
[SPEAKER_01]: people leave but this night he just
decided to just drop me off and like tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me he'd meet me in the morning and we'll
do the deal so I didn't think anything of
[SPEAKER_01]: it you know it was pretty late I go
stumbling in the house and the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed is my sliding out door was
broken into so I ran straight to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fridge and seeing it was gone the weed the
house they went through everything they
[SPEAKER_01]: found my headstache they found a few grand
cash I had a nice watch somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_01]: house they took everything I think they
left me like a little graham nugget like a
[SPEAKER_01]: joke so because of that the same guy the
man guy from England he felt bad again for
[SPEAKER_01]: me and then that became my opportunity to
partner up with him on that house
[SPEAKER_01]: basically because he was actually trying
to get another house going somewhere north
[SPEAKER_01]: like a couple hours north he found 10
acres of a nice house on it and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to set it up spent a lot of time
there and it was a perfect perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for him to have a partner at
the time and so I he got me he got me to
[SPEAKER_01]: move out of that place obviously and I did
I realized pretty quickly that the guy Joe
[SPEAKER_01]: was a thief and just didn't make sense a
lot of things that happened and I called
[SPEAKER_01]: him out over on the phone you know
basically admitted to it kind of told me
[SPEAKER_01]: to fuck off and come to find out he was
smoking coke and doing free base and like
[SPEAKER_01]: really fucking up in life so that's why he
got to be that type of person so I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that side of the guy at all you know
I just kind of was making money and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of blind to it all so it was actually
that guy I guess you could all think for
[SPEAKER_01]: my situation and the OG Christian TK
because of those robberies I was given the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to run a group and that's
where that scene mistake actually happened
[SPEAKER_05]: with that group wow thank you free base
coke no let me just quickly jump in for a
[SPEAKER_05]: second there because there's so much
interesting details there the first thing
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to quickly ask you is that first
time when you went over to Amsterdam did
[SPEAKER_05]: you bring any genetics back and as a
follow-up was there any interesting weed
[SPEAKER_01]: you tried while over there the first time
I went we didn't find that that good a
[SPEAKER_01]: weed actually the first trip and the guys
I was with were kind of arrogant I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: you could call it we already had good weed
in Florida so we went there with high
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations so all the coffee shops we
hit up the first day or two were just like
[SPEAKER_01]: generic orange bud that seemed like it was
the same stuff being passed around all the
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shops like it's tourist weed and I
mean we actually found some good hash that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was like stoked on but as far as
actual flower no actually it took two days
[SPEAKER_01]: and that trip is kind of a short trip I
think we moved for like six or seven days
[SPEAKER_01]: that trip but like maybe day two or three
we're out drinking at a pub playing pool a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of us and we met this couple and we
knew we were there for the seed bank we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know where it was yet we don't even
knew about the seed bank because it was in
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of high time magazine they had
these little articles back then all the
[SPEAKER_05]: time and sorry just to confirm you mean
like Neville's the seed bank DC bank yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: this was 1989 yeah cool keep going so this
couple has some good weed on and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually rolling up cones and mixing
tobacco in it so we refuse to do that but
[SPEAKER_01]: we took a little noggin roll our own joint
it was really good I can't remember what
[SPEAKER_01]: it was but it was that couple that
basically gave us told us how to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed bank which was at the cannabis
castle the time and we thought we could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually walk to it but we found out it
was like an hour hour and a half away by
[SPEAKER_01]: taxi which we had no clue where that was
so I think the next day some of the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: contacted the seed bank made sure they
were open before we tracked off we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: directions and there was like four of us
got in the van and went there that day and
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbed a bunch of stuff and you know when
I first came out I might have said I met
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville back in the day or whatever but I
mean I knew we had never never was that
[SPEAKER_01]: then straight up nobody did I mean maybe
some people that live there whatever did
[SPEAKER_01]: but we only knew of the seed bank and all
the stories of Neville didn't come out so
[SPEAKER_01]: many years later so we had all the
packaging we had the catalogs from there
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know that's what I meant by we
shopped at Neville's place the seed bank
[SPEAKER_01]: basically so yeah I don't know we could
have met him but I was so young we went
[SPEAKER_01]: shopping there we went to the castle there
was a little it was kind of like a living
[SPEAKER_01]: room you walk into it seemed like somebody
lived there and that's where they had
[SPEAKER_01]: their little shop and I later find out
they had like a basement where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing but I never saw any of that we've
seen a big greenhouse out back but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people working there's two or three four
people working there in the front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time that's who we dealt with don't know
who they were names or Neville was one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them probably not so I know that right at
the end of 89 apparently it was close to
[SPEAKER_01]: when he was almost getting in trouble were
indicted so who knows where he was at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time but it was definitely the cannabis
castle that we shopped at and we grabbed a
[SPEAKER_01]: good majority of the stuff we could and
grab like there's think five growers out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the group and they're trying to get
like a couple packs of each for all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them so we're trying to get I think like a
dozen of each variety they had on the menu
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of it I didn't even see later on
like basically we got back to Florida and
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff all got divided up amongst
everybody and basically the Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: that I ended up popping with a real small
pack for some reason on them maybe it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like they were low on inventory I know it
wasn't in the catalog and I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people's plan that wasn't in the catalog
and trying to prove whatever story that
[SPEAKER_01]: line about because it wasn't a lot about
them but whatever reason it was he gave us
[SPEAKER_01]: a pack of Hindu seeds and you push seeds
and they ended up being the ones that made
[SPEAKER_01]: the following the emerald triangle room
that you know created the triangle with
[SPEAKER_05]: those sorry I'll just drill into some
specifics because I know people will be
[SPEAKER_05]: interested do you when you say a small
pack you mean like there was only like six
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and not like ten or something yeah I
know I was like a single pack you know
[SPEAKER_01]: like maybe ten or twelve seeds it was I
think by then I want to say okay and for
[SPEAKER_01]: some reason they charge less for those
than everything else I think they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: two dollars a seed or some other stuff on
the menu was like five a seed they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually had a couple other fish varieties
on the menu I remember that one was sold
[SPEAKER_01]: out of like push times push and then
another one we brought back was like
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes push and for some reason those
were two dollars a piece each you know so
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't even think they're that good to
be honest we thought they were based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the price that there you know he was like
giving away freebie type things okay and
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Hindu Kush seeds that you ended up
popping with a in like packaging that said
[SPEAKER_05]: Hindu Kush or was it just generic
packaging or was it in like a pack that
[SPEAKER_05]: said something else but he was like oh by
the way this is actually Hindu Kush I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty sure they're all an actual seed
bank packaging but there we had to like
[SPEAKER_01]: consolidate them when we were out there
like yeah back home and I like little dime
[SPEAKER_01]: bags and then we hand wrote on everything
and I don't know who kept all the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging on that trip I know some of the
party came back with us I know that some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the catalogs did too and I kept the
catalog myself for you know it was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: porn magazine I kept and looked at all the
time but I can't remember if it was if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all basically the seed bank
packaging that we took back and the Hindu
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush was one of them or we just you know I
just know that we had a pack of Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from there that day and it was
written on it and did any of the other
[SPEAKER_05]: packs you got end up turning into anything
memorable or was it really just that Hindu
[SPEAKER_05]: Kush that ended up being the memorable one
for obvious reasons no we were we did a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch actually for there was definitely
some prior to that we were just an
[SPEAKER_01]: organized five testing we found a really
nice early pearl and a really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: northern lights five haze that was
actually a quick finisher like 70 days or
[SPEAKER_01]: something and they were you know the guys
I was with they're all about the big
[SPEAKER_01]: yields and the fastest finish they can get
and banging out you know that's and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically trying to squeeze five six
pounds with a year so it was all about
[SPEAKER_01]: making the money you know I'm not gonna
lie if if we had the opportunity back then
[SPEAKER_01]: and Florida was just that way if we had
the opportunity like in California or
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington or places Hawaii or wherever
you could actually get away with growing
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor I'm sure we would have been more
into the you know that side of it but it
[SPEAKER_01]: was all about props you know making crop
making money out of the crops and fast as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible following these guys were all
after the speed clones and started you
[SPEAKER_01]: know genetics basically that would we're
done in eight weeks nine weeks max and
[SPEAKER_01]: then beyond that they would pretty much
give away or throw out so we went through
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of nl5 haze and only kept one and
some of the guys actually they had a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more patience than the guy I worked
with and we actually do some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff a little longer so when it came down
to me buying some of the weed I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: always get just our stuff and my friend
was getting it from his little like co-op
[SPEAKER_01]: of friends that he had you know that to
get from so if I needed five six pounds a
[SPEAKER_01]: week one week and we didn't have any he
would get it from somebody else for me and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those guys grew that haze way
better than we did for whatever reason I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure they let it go longer like for us the
guy would take it down like 60 days and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was still like a lot of white hairs and
it's kind of like rebel hairy orangey in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bag type look other time it would go a
little bit longer it seemed like it would
[SPEAKER_01]: swell up more maybe in the winter months
or something but yeah we ran that a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: times we ran the northern lights that was
real short squat big fat leaves and it
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't yield that good we found a big
skunk that was good they found a sheba
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk that was good from that that was a
huge yielder I didn't like the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: actually personally but a lot of people
liked it and they sold tons of it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it made you know like giant plants for
whatever reason I think you know like back
[SPEAKER_01]: then we were getting an average around two
pounds of light and this this stuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason was getting three pounds
of light so it got all these guys all
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to grow that one I didn't like it
like I said and then there was what else
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to mind some of the genetics these
guys had when I came on board were
[SPEAKER_01]: actually some of the better stuff still
that I remember growing back then it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like the animal triangle the guy that we
got the animal triangle from came from
[SPEAKER_01]: washington state and he was probably 20
years old than me so yeah he was 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: old and all my crew but I think he might
have been the guy that taught these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole method of growing the nutrients
and the whole setup basically because he
[SPEAKER_01]: brought it from washington I want to say
like around 86 or so 87 and that's when he
[SPEAKER_01]: took these genetics over here so he was
the one that gave these guys the animal
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle they had William's Wonder they
had a clone of Big Bud and I want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: the original G13 that we had came from him
although I can't confirm that but that one
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen around Florida for years what
else there was a couple others he might
[SPEAKER_01]: have brought over but yeah he was the one
that basically started these guys I think
[SPEAKER_01]: on their path of you know they how they
did their thing wow that's that's so cool
[SPEAKER_05]: to hear what a what an awesome range of
genetics that was sort of going around I
[SPEAKER_05]: want to quickly ask before we jump into
the emerald triangle stuff because I know
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone's itching for it you mentioned
Williams Wonder I'm a sucker for Williams
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonder I love it what was your memory of
that special client was it a good one I
[SPEAKER_01]: loved it it was it was the first time I've
seen like real clumpy talc stack you know
[SPEAKER_01]: like neon green colorful weed like that it
was one of the first thing I seen growing
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the first house I went to trim
that I asked I was asked to go to trim was
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a room of Williams Wonder
and Big Bud and something else I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember but yeah that was the first time
I ever seen like a full 12 light room
[SPEAKER_01]: going of anything I love smoking that
stuff it was always tasty interesting that
[SPEAKER_05]: that's really cool to hear and the
gentleman who you describe as like
[SPEAKER_05]: possibly the one who introduced your
friends to the whole growing scene what
[SPEAKER_05]: was he like was he that typical old-school
like you know kept his head down didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: talk much about it or was he like willing
to chat to you a bit about things I never
[SPEAKER_01]: got to talk to him much I met him a couple
times and my friends just like coming and
[SPEAKER_01]: going and and my friend would tell me you
know stories about him and who he was but
[SPEAKER_01]: he was to himself yeah I think he had like
a 20 acre plant farm up in Palm Beach I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to say and one crazy story I do
remember for sure about him was he had
[SPEAKER_01]: like a 30 or 40 light like steel building
going with propane going for co2 and I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess the guy had a big plant nursery and
this was like in the center of his
[SPEAKER_01]: property and was next to a big lake that
he had and I think something happened with
[SPEAKER_01]: a propane tank where it blew up the
building like midway through a batch and
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy had like a bunch of excavators on
the property and tractors and stuff and I
[SPEAKER_01]: heard that he pushed the entire building
that night into the lake after like burned
[SPEAKER_01]: down or I don't know maybe it went out
real quick or something but like the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: building imploded and he took his
excavator and pushed it all in the lake
[SPEAKER_01]: and then buried that lake a few days later
and that was the last of it so that's that
[SPEAKER_01]: guy was pretty pretty heavy and back then
hearing about 40 lighter or whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: was that he had it was just like holy shit
that's crazy because 12 lights was already
[SPEAKER_05]: sketchy as can be wow yeah I can only
imagine back at that time 40 lighter would
[SPEAKER_05]: have been insanity so let's just quickly
jump back to it then so you've got back
[SPEAKER_05]: from Amsterdam you've got these new
genetics how did things progress from that
[SPEAKER_05]: point to when you eventually began
involved in the house where you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: started popping some of those seeds such
as the Hindu Kush well basically once I
[SPEAKER_01]: got robbed by that guy and moved out I got
myself a place maybe a mile away from that
[SPEAKER_01]: other girl house my friend had he actually
owned the house and once he let me start
[SPEAKER_01]: taking over and sharing a batch with him
and started doing this thing up north I
[SPEAKER_01]: would start riding my bike there or
driving we had a car parked there
[SPEAKER_01]: overnight like a decoy car but I was able
to ride my bike there even walk there if I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to so I started going there daily
taking care of the place he would still
[SPEAKER_01]: come down like once a week maybe twice a
week from time to make sure everything was
[SPEAKER_01]: cool checking on me checking on everything
that was going on so yeah I was at that
[SPEAKER_01]: house that we would start popping those
seeds and at this point I was like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I was starting to get really into it
and I was super intrigued to find new
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors all the time so I was probably
more into it than these guys were as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as finding that new genetic and they'd
normally would we had like a little space
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll explain how the room was set up
eventually but we had a little space by
[SPEAKER_01]: our doorway where we had like a little
space for four plants five plants maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's where we would do our testing
at so we didn't even have like a dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: area it was just kind of like a little
extra space we had a little closet
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere where we would sex plants to see
if they're male or female but then once
[SPEAKER_01]: they were they were sex we would put them
in there and test them and if they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: turn out like phenomenal they would
usually get canned like on the first batch
[SPEAKER_01]: or given away to somebody if they were
good so there's only like a handful we
[SPEAKER_01]: really kept and like lots of stuff that I
really we went through that I wish we kept
[SPEAKER_01]: like there was one called Hawaiian snow
that to me was like the first time I ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen a bag like squeeze the bag and I just
leave like a super shiny shiny coat on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag it was like real neon green some sort
of sativa cross I can't remember what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was but they killed it immediately of
course you know I had like headstashed of
[SPEAKER_01]: it for a while and got to enjoy maybe a
pound of it or something but that was when
[SPEAKER_01]: they killed off I wish they kept there was
a handful and a bunch of them I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there was like a northern lights time
skunk there was a handful of good ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that just never made the cut because like
I said these guys were sticking to those
[SPEAKER_01]: big yielders and you know they seemed to
be happy with what they already had seemed
[SPEAKER_05]: like for the most part that's interesting
to hear yeah I can imagine that like stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: would have been quick to be culled back in
those days so what was who was it who
[SPEAKER_05]: decided to pop the seeds did you have a
feeling about these Hindu Kush seeds or
[SPEAKER_02]: how did that all go down I don't exactly
remember why I think they were just maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: next in line or something I know for a
fact that like the one before that like
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first came out I wasn't 100% sure
it was a Hindu I told a couple people that
[SPEAKER_01]: it was either a Hindu or northern lights
or a couple different things I wasn't 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: sure on but then once me and my friend
Craig started talking about it all because
[SPEAKER_01]: he was super into all these different
genetics like me he would come down and I
[SPEAKER_01]: had this little tackle box with like these
little dividers and it kept like a real
[SPEAKER_01]: seal lid and I kept all these different
flavors in there for I don't know why but
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just something at the time and he
came down and we would basically go
[SPEAKER_01]: through these like they were in our own
little like mini cannabis cup and sample
[SPEAKER_01]: them all out and bomb hits and joints and
so for sure he talked about the the seeded
[SPEAKER_01]: Hindu Kush and the Hindu Kush that we grew
it was like there was like probably five
[SPEAKER_01]: plants there was like two real short
mutant ones that I had to like prop up off
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground because they weren't getting
any light and there's two that were like
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of reaching up to the trellis so
there was definitely not a consistent as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as the growth structure there's like I
said there's almost like two Anikas and
[SPEAKER_01]: two almost like hybrid kind of leaning
stretchy plants but whatever it was they
[SPEAKER_01]: all tasted just super different and
incredible like so bomb them I my friend
[SPEAKER_01]: killed them all off after he did because I
would take them all home for some
[SPEAKER_01]: headstache grown or something about you
know if I had to but he basically killed
[SPEAKER_01]: them all off because he didn't want to
take a chance of any more seeds coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere we'd never found the hermit plant
we basically just cut everything dried it
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's we found out the seeds were in
there afterwards so I ended up taking I
[SPEAKER_01]: think those plants to smoke basically and
we killed off he killed off all the bombs
[SPEAKER_01]: that we kept from seed and that was the
last of the Hindu basically but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely different in Craig and I we had
seeds over a while that was probably you
[SPEAKER_01]: know crossed with itself or whatever and I
had a seed collection in this hollow coke
[SPEAKER_01]: can this years later this happened but
that's cooking at all these seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: that batch and other batches the animal
triangle batches that were seeded here and
[SPEAKER_01]: there just a collection I have from
Amsterdam still from 93 when I went back
[SPEAKER_01]: and this girl I was dating at the time I
went to like us on a surf trip and she was
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to clean my house and I do me a
favor and I surprised me and I come home
[SPEAKER_01]: and the coke can was in the refrigerator
and I guess she threw it out but she'll
[SPEAKER_01]: deny it to this day because she never
admitted to it but she was probably
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning the house and try to pop the can
and it went open and she probably looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like an old can and she just tossed it but
that that can add so many good season is
[SPEAKER_05]: ridiculous that that sounds so there's
like a lot of critical information in
[SPEAKER_05]: there I'd love to get a few specifics so
you know for anyone who's not familiar
[SPEAKER_05]: like the the idea is that you know the tea
can okay and OG Kush came from an
[SPEAKER_05]: accidental pollination involving this
unknown clone called the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Hindu Kush that we're speaking
about so so just to confirm there was no
[SPEAKER_05]: males in the room it was it was a Hermi
pollen donor never saw a male we never had
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds before in the in the Emerald
Triangle there's definitely no light leaks
[SPEAKER_01]: because that was something that I was
always warned and never open the doors and
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's you know there's no flashing
lights in the room or anything we never
[SPEAKER_01]: found we never found a culprit so I had to
be we just assumed it had to be from one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those plants that went Hermi and I mean
never even knew what a Hermi was at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point I was pretty young it was my first
year early growing weed on that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: scale and I had never really seen a Hermi
before that so didn't really know what to
[SPEAKER_01]: look for didn't know that some small plant
like that can make so much pollen with
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen in most of the room but the way the
room was set up we had a AC added to the
[SPEAKER_01]: room like a five ton AC unit and it was
like four feet away from the door so in
[SPEAKER_01]: the way I guess we had the fan set up so
it circulated the room like like cyclonic
[SPEAKER_01]: and apparently it just sucked all that
pollen right directly into the AC event
[SPEAKER_01]: and then spread across through the vents
across the whole room so that was you know
[SPEAKER_01]: something we never thought about when we
were testing the seeds there obviously at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point we obviously thought you know I
only thought males could do that and so
[SPEAKER_01]: once we realized we had no males we
thought we were good to go so yeah so
[SPEAKER_05]: based on what you're saying there was like
quite a fair bit of seed produced in the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall crop well I was pretty
consistently seeded but some people said
[SPEAKER_01]: they found a shitloaded in there other
people said they couldn't find but maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: one so it wasn't like really really spread
across the room there's crazy thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: never had on a batch that was like said he
opened up a bud and every single little
[SPEAKER_01]: nugget had a seed in it so maybe that was
closer to the vent or to the pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: or something but yeah it wasn't really
really bad like like I like Anderson for
[SPEAKER_01]: example the one who found the OG push seed
he swears that there wasn't many seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: all yeah like I think he bought four
ounces off Craig back then that came from
[SPEAKER_01]: me and out of out of those four ounces I
think he said he found one or two seeds I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to say so he'll sit there and argue
that it was not many seeds at all but that
[SPEAKER_05]: was definitely from the same batch of
weeding yeah wow okay sorry I'm gonna have
[SPEAKER_05]: to keep pulling us back because there's so
many interesting details here so so when
[SPEAKER_05]: you talk about the Hindu having those two
different sort of phenotypes generally
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking the squatter ones you had to prop
up and the lankier ones those lankier ones
[SPEAKER_05]: did they sort of have a structure that
resembled the OG in the TK to you that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't remember I just know that they were
really small plants when I put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: there there's kind of like last minute
kind of thing I tossed them in and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of grew like single stock being
pulled through like little nuggets across
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole branch no side arms really
because they never really had a chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: veg out much so that's why I was really
about me to get to run on a second time
[SPEAKER_05]: sure and and in terms of the the smoke you
know you said it was good smoke were there
[SPEAKER_05]: any of those four plants four or five
plants of the Hindu when you smoke them
[SPEAKER_05]: was there anything about them that
reminded you of the OG or the TK or do you
[SPEAKER_05]: think maybe the end product is more
reflective of the Emerald Triangle um hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to say it was a the Emerald Triangle has
kind of like a much thicker structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: we would top those and the way we grew it
was off the ground I'll get into that real
[SPEAKER_01]: quick the way the rim was set up so this
this I think it was brought from
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington also this blueprint of how we
did everything with stolen power and a
[SPEAKER_01]: five ton AC with 12 lights that particular
nutrient brand and everything so we would
[SPEAKER_01]: get into a garage you know these guys did
anyway I helped a couple later on but they
[SPEAKER_01]: would go into a clear garage clean it out
and then run a hose across the floor and
[SPEAKER_01]: find where the water would puddle the most
and then that's where they would drill
[SPEAKER_01]: like a half inch hole I would go through
the slab of the house to the ground and I
[SPEAKER_01]: do like 12 or so holes in that room so
basically once you set up the room the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are growing on the ground and they
would do drip to waste and then the water
[SPEAKER_01]: would find its way to those holes and
that's basically how these are ever set up
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'll the ground um basically well first
off they would set up three um garbage
[SPEAKER_01]: cans where like the stations or the like a
big pickle barrel or where they would feed
[SPEAKER_01]: from and each one controlled 100 plants on
the ground and there was a divider wall
[SPEAKER_01]: where the the barrels were and like the
hose and everything was usually where the
[SPEAKER_01]: garage door was we built like a little
divider wall and then beyond that was
[SPEAKER_01]: where the grow room was so those three um
barrels would control 300 plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: would sit on the ground in rows in one
gallon pots and clay pebbles and we used
[SPEAKER_01]: to use these little skinny like black
drippers um like a little spaghetti
[SPEAKER_01]: dripper they call it by then and we used
to use common Home Depot timers like
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware store timers and run them at like
every two hours for like one or two
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes I want to say so that's basically
was the dripping the water the watering
[SPEAKER_01]: system the lighting we used to have these
round Chinese hat style hoods and you put
[SPEAKER_01]: them together and they end up being like
four feet around and they had vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting by then and those so we had
checkerboard halide sodium um in those
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and they're super lightweight and
you can control them from a single string
[SPEAKER_01]: so what we would do is at the doorway at
the garage we'd have these like dock
[SPEAKER_01]: pleats where you could tie off to and each
light had its own little pulley attached
[SPEAKER_01]: to the ceiling and so once we had built
the trellis in the room um you could
[SPEAKER_01]: control all the lights like height and
lowering them wherever from the doorway
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically that's how the lights were
set up we had like 2d minifiers up high on
[SPEAKER_01]: the wall where the water just ran to the
floor and we had a five ton ac and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this needed extra power so back then
obviously everyone was stealing power like
[SPEAKER_01]: it was no big deal which was sketching
itself because everybody knew that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: got caught just doing that you're facing
some sort of federal felony by the power
[SPEAKER_01]: company and um they could you know sue you
and all this stuff so that that part alone
[SPEAKER_01]: was sketchy but uh you can do 12 lights in
florida back then without stealing power
[SPEAKER_05]: unless you have like a mansion wow that's
that's really interesting i mean gosh a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot i'm sure it's well thought out when
you had those holes on the ground and the
[SPEAKER_05]: plants were on the ground did it not get
like really cold um i'm sure it did but
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it was florida um so we like i
said was that south florida and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: hotter down there than than other places
i've grown but um i don't seem to remember
[SPEAKER_01]: any issues all the patches will turn out
pretty good in there and like the weed was
[SPEAKER_01]: always fire um as far as temps and i could
see if you're up like in northern like new
[SPEAKER_01]: york or up north that would probably be
too cold on the ground you'd almost have
[SPEAKER_01]: to add heating or something to the to the
floor if you did it that way but in
[SPEAKER_01]: florida we didn't have that problem um and
and going back to that room uh we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: quite finish the trellis basically we was
put these first strips of wood around the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire room in two different levels and go
around and attach little eye hooklets
[SPEAKER_01]: every like foot or so and then it would
take two people we'd go in the room while
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants were small and have a roll of
twine we would toss back and forth with
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and like loop through the eye
hooklets and make like a weave trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: basically and we'd work our way and the
two weaved all the way out to the door uh
[SPEAKER_01]: took a while but once we got to the door
that was like the last time you could get
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room basically so once you got it
all trellis off so i mentioned that before
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past about the homemade trellis we
used to do because you couldn't buy
[SPEAKER_01]: trellis back then um so basically this
whole 12 light room was completely trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: off with two layers of nets you know and
then they didn't come down into harvest
[SPEAKER_05]: basically that's a cool setup gosh you got
me thinking i could probably integrate
[SPEAKER_05]: some of these practices into my grow as
far as the veg back then what we did was
[SPEAKER_01]: uh we would take phones into one inch
cubes it was rock bowls already around in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 80s um so we would put them in one
inch cubes they would take like 400 at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time to get 300 good ones and then they
would go in a three inch cube with holes
[SPEAKER_01]: in them and then from there we didn't have
uh grow tables back then so we built our
[SPEAKER_01]: own um so the mom room was built on these
big wooden grow tables that had shower
[SPEAKER_01]: liner um on top of it like glued together
to keep the water from leaking and uh they
[SPEAKER_01]: had like two or three thousand watt lights
in that room with big moms and containers
[SPEAKER_01]: getting drippers with the rocks then the
small veg room where the babies would go
[SPEAKER_01]: into was like a like a bit probably like
an eight by four by eight table they built
[SPEAKER_01]: with wood plywood with sides and they also
used the shower liner on that too and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would be on a tilt and they would put all
the three inch cubes on there um with a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand watt over those and to water them
they would just you know dump water down
[SPEAKER_01]: one side of the table and it would run
down through all the plants to the other
[SPEAKER_01]: sides of the dramica so we would get them
like about a foot tall in there pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much before they would go into the main
room and that's when they would go into
[SPEAKER_01]: the one gallon pots with the rocks and the
drippers and they would get a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: size in those three inch cubes i mean
they'd be fully white roots you know
[SPEAKER_01]: busting out the bottom of them you know by
the time you put them in the rocks um so
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we would start off with the
lights all the way up at the ceiling we
[SPEAKER_01]: put first put them in there because back
then there was no dimming or whatever so
[SPEAKER_01]: we were using thousand watt lights so we
kept them all the way out of the ceiling
[SPEAKER_01]: and the lights with the work the way down
on the first week you know we'd slowly
[SPEAKER_05]: bring them down off the pulley nice nice
and i'd love to ask you before i forget
[SPEAKER_05]: tell me a bit about um the emerald
triangle strain itself you know i think a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of people would be really interested
in that one do you did you see like how
[SPEAKER_05]: would you describe it was it a kush type
plant was it a more lanky plant what's
[SPEAKER_01]: your recollection uh well the first time i
i used to buy it before i seen it growing
[SPEAKER_01]: for a couple years i know it was around
before i ever seen the grow um these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: were growing probably i think from like 86
87 or whatever when that guy brought the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics to florida um so that one off the
floor off the one gallon pots top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pot would grow to be about four foot tall
on average maybe a little bit taller um we
[SPEAKER_01]: topped it and it would grow four or five
heads but there are thicker stems and
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely way bigger leaves than any of
the triangle or og's i've seen actually
[SPEAKER_01]: i've seen a couple big leaves on some of
the og's but this these seem to get pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: big and as far as smell i seem to remember
it definitely had more of a floral sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: scent to it it was definitely super good
it had like more of a candy kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: leaning term i want to say um and knowing
where it came from you know and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: stories since then there's a good chance
it has some northern lights in it because
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean that's the northwest up there in
washington we got to give them profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: because first off that's where most of the
northern lights came from um you know i've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard multiple stories now basically
that's where they originally originated
[SPEAKER_01]: from and even neville supposedly got a lot
of his seeds from there they took back to
[SPEAKER_01]: and for them they started breeding with
also um from the northwest was uh emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle um from washington and then
there's years prior there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: kryptonite strand here in florida that was
the rumors uh that the clone came from
[SPEAKER_01]: seattle area as well from like a scientist
that worked at a college there or
[SPEAKER_01]: something um that was more of an 80s
genetic but uh yeah there's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: been a lot of stuff come from that zone um
between there and santa cruz and there my
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle of california that whole pacific
northwest out there you definitely got to
[SPEAKER_01]: give him credit for a lot of the stuff a
lot of it went full circle to Amsterdam to
[SPEAKER_01]: florida and back and whatever um but the
perfect salad came together in the house
[SPEAKER_05]: that we were growing yeah no huge credit
to the pacific northwest they've they've
[SPEAKER_05]: done a lot some of my favorite strains
like the blue magoo come from that area so
[SPEAKER_05]: huge huge work done there by those guys i
guess i'd be interested in terms of the
[SPEAKER_05]: emerald triangle itself if you had to pick
do you feel like the og and the tk lean
[SPEAKER_05]: more towards the emerald triangle maybe
the hindu or like some sort of unique
[SPEAKER_05]: combo of the two that's not necessarily
like one or the other uh it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_02]: mix because the emerald definitely wasn't
making like popcorn nuggets i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember or like spears like bigger spear
buds and like i said it definitely was a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger yielder and definitely bigger stems
i remember he used to have to use like um
[SPEAKER_01]: yard loppers that cut them down they get
so fat you know versus like the tk and the
[SPEAKER_01]: og you can cut them down almost with
scissors at times um so there's that it
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely made bigger leaves because it
was actually some of the bigger leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: i've never seen at the time growing i'd
also be we're growing at that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: moment or error um but like yeah i really
can't say as far as like the gassy notes i
[SPEAKER_01]: can't i don't remember it having too much
gas to it now the the hindu um i can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember i can't pinpoint if those are
gassy or not either but they're extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: different than anything we had or smoked
before um so you know the the fact that i
[SPEAKER_01]: i kind of pointing towards those is
because like years later in the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: years there was a lot of information came
out from like neville himself and other
[SPEAKER_01]: people um that have claimed that his hindu
kush work was basically nl2 crossed with
[SPEAKER_01]: uh kush4 i've heard a couple other
different stories too but they always
[SPEAKER_01]: included northern lights type genetics so
there's that yeah yeah i've heard some of
[SPEAKER_05]: those comments as well so you know i think
that's reasonable i'd be interested to
[SPEAKER_05]: know so when you did this crop was it
basically like a room full of emerald
[SPEAKER_05]: triangle plus these hindu plants or is
were there other plants in the room like
[SPEAKER_05]: were you doing a mix sort of thing or how
was the setup let me try to do one main
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic at a time for whatever reason i
think just based on how big our moms were
[SPEAKER_01]: that we had we only had limited space and
uh this group of guys would pass genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: around and try between us and we would
grow out two or three big moms of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that would be the one that we would
take thumbs off of for example so for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason that room i did was all
emerald triangle is like 300 emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle plants and then those five or six
uh hindus uh interesting okay so when you
[SPEAKER_05]: got to the end of the harvest and you're
seeing there's these seeds in the bud were
[SPEAKER_05]: there enough seeds that you thought oh
this is going to affect the ticket or was
[SPEAKER_05]: it like you know you couldn't really tell
it unless you cracked it open and did you
[SPEAKER_01]: pop any of those seeds um it definitely
affected the ticket and the owner of the
[SPEAKER_01]: house my partner he was definitely pissed
off at first um because in his mind we
[SPEAKER_01]: were taking away tons of weight from the
plants focusing on the energy towards
[SPEAKER_01]: making seeds so he always had this set
thing in his mind where he had to get at
[SPEAKER_01]: least you know like 24 pounds per room two
pounds per light or he was pissed off i
[SPEAKER_01]: think and i think that room ended up being
maybe like 20 pounds or whatever i want to
[SPEAKER_01]: say um so yeah he was pissed but at the
same time i sold it all immediately to my
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy craig up in orlando and to my buddy
mike loop up in that same area too and uh
[SPEAKER_01]: so luckily that's who got those because
craig's friends that would end up finding
[SPEAKER_05]: the tk and the ogc later on yeah okay i
mean i want to hear about that but i want
[SPEAKER_05]: to quickly ask did you pop any of those
seeds immediately or did you sort of just
[SPEAKER_05]: put it on the back burner and then yeah
tell us a bit about how the weed went from
[SPEAKER_01]: there and where the seeds ended up going i
personally didn't pop a lot of those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of those seeds ended up going into
that coke pan like i talked about i
[SPEAKER_01]: collected thousands of them and i had like
this huge black baggie of them um i never
[SPEAKER_01]: had a chance to pop many of them because
like i said they got tossed out a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: years later um i had a few friends that
tried popping some here and there i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember anything that came out like super
keeper style we've you know i seen some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that had similar structure maybe to
the og and tk like brown popcorn like
[SPEAKER_01]: bacon bacon shaped like clumpy nuggets you
know growing up as the main chef and had
[SPEAKER_01]: that same pushy look to it but definitely
wasn't like super dank like some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff we already had at the time also
there was uh well there was another strain
[SPEAKER_01]: i'll get into that story as well but there
was another strain that came into our
[SPEAKER_01]: group called the hash plant that went by
um so basically this was like a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: years later it's like 93 94 um so a friend
of mine one day they called me up and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me he has this plant at his house
that his bitchy girlfriend wanted out
[SPEAKER_01]: there immediately so he asked me to come
over and get it if i would um i guess he
[SPEAKER_01]: knew i agree with the time it's kind of
reasoning why i asked so i went over there
[SPEAKER_01]: was place there was this little ceiling
that was probably like six inches tall and
[SPEAKER_01]: like a solo cup so i took it and he swore
that it came from some of the best weed
[SPEAKER_01]: he's ever seen in his life some of the
stinkiest shit ever and i had to try it i
[SPEAKER_01]: had to make sure i didn't kill it whatever
so i took good care of it for a minute i
[SPEAKER_01]: took it to my friend's house that wrote at
this point in time i had moved on i was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing my own thing and and like we stopped
doing the partnership thing together but i
[SPEAKER_01]: was still helping him do the trimming and
helping him sell the weed so i took this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant over there um to his place and i set
it up inside in the mom room and i came
[SPEAKER_01]: back a couple days later and it was gone
and i asked him like where it went he said
[SPEAKER_01]: he tossed it in the trash because it had
this like mutated looking leaf and he
[SPEAKER_01]: usually thought that those kind of
ceilings were shit so he didn't want it
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore so he's throwing the trash on me
so i go to the trash without like the lid
[SPEAKER_01]: was half open still and it was like light
getting in there and i pull it out it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still alive i was like trying to grow
through some debris in the trash can i
[SPEAKER_01]: take it home with me and it did have a
weird lead by nurses at the health to
[SPEAKER_01]: where it started growing normal leaves
again uh so at this place in point in time
[SPEAKER_01]: i had two like lights at this house i
lived in and it was just more for like
[SPEAKER_01]: hobby and personal stash and help facing
bills and once that plant got big enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to take enough clowns to fill the two
lights up with i flowered it out by itself
[SPEAKER_01]: and ended up being some super stinky like
really really good weed just like the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: said um but it made his own seeds for
whatever reason there was no other plants
[SPEAKER_01]: there that did it there was no light leaks
nothing um it made you know probably 10 20
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds per plant or whatever it was small
amount and uh those seeds would go on to
[SPEAKER_01]: be some of the stinkiest best weed i have
ever seen to this day and i would
[SPEAKER_01]: literally almost like trade my truck right
now and heartbeat for any one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: that we had that's how good they were um i
know we're jumping around all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: place time what time frame whatever but
just going talking about the video um so
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway that that particular variety we
never ran in the big room because we knew
[SPEAKER_01]: it made seeds but i kept it around anyways
for personal and those seeds from that for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason i decided to start popping
once i bought my own house like a year
[SPEAKER_01]: later 2000 or 1994 uh bought my own house
on the jupiter and we started going
[SPEAKER_01]: through those seeds and it took a long
time to realize it and we named a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: them with numbers it was like hp4 and nine
and a bunch of different numbers and
[SPEAKER_01]: passed them around and like some of the
best stuff like like ever the number four
[SPEAKER_01]: was these like skinny leaf jagged sharp
edge with like leaves almost like razor
[SPEAKER_01]: sharp almost like a soft tooth or
something um and i've never seen a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: like that before and that was the best one
of them all and it happened to be the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that got some sort of virus like within a
year or two and died off unfortunately um
[SPEAKER_01]: that was my favorite um there's three or
four others that went on to be like
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely stinky and good that like people
would grow it and almost almost i like run
[SPEAKER_01]: into the law immediately because it was so
strong so come to find out years later i
[SPEAKER_01]: ran into the guy that the original seed
came from and he we were at a strip club
[SPEAKER_01]: one night and we're drinking conversation
about this stuff told him a story about
[SPEAKER_01]: that seedling he laughed was like you know
what that was from a super skunk crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: with a hash plant that made his own seeds
for some reason the room made a few seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and like that's where your buddy found
that seed from so yeah it was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk crossed with hash plant i
don't know where the seed came from he
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know where it came from but
everything that that those seeds you know
[SPEAKER_01]: almost everything we popped out of those
seeds where it's like keeper style there's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a handful that weren't but like
the majority the ones we kept were just
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the all-time my all-time favorites
um and there might be one still around
[SPEAKER_01]: this day that somebody made seeds with i'm
trying to track down and uh we just had a
[SPEAKER_05]: hard time finding stuff so far yeah shout
out get in touch with marty if you know
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that sounds cool man so i i mean
i'd love to know what was the path from
[SPEAKER_05]: you know the point of your first sale to i
believe you said craig and another guy how
[SPEAKER_05]: did that then transition into having tk
the og to the best of your knowledge well
[SPEAKER_01]: uh that see the batch of ammo triangle
that happened in 1991 that was the year i
[SPEAKER_01]: was living on that house um and at that
point craig was coming down and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff from me directly and or i would
bring up stuff to him sometimes they gave
[SPEAKER_01]: him a five or ten pack on the front
getting out the cash for it and we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: working relationship like that um so at
some point in time he got a hold of like
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 of the seated pounds took him back up
there and his dad uh at the time was
[SPEAKER_01]: helping him sell the weed his dad had a
karate studio and a surf shop and had a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of clientele and surfer friends this
mode so they had a lot of people they sold
[SPEAKER_01]: to so they sold you know three four pounds
every couple days basically piecing them
[SPEAKER_01]: out so they would go through a 10 pack in
a week or two weeks pretty fast by then so
[SPEAKER_01]: it was out of that batch that craig had
sold to his good friend who i had met a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of times over the years and he's
the guy that found the tk another guy was
[SPEAKER_01]: alex anderson which i never met him back
in the day but or never heard him really
[SPEAKER_01]: until recently but he also had bought a
quarter pound the other guy bought like a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound or a couple pounds of it and found a
bunch of seeds the guy alex anderson only
[SPEAKER_01]: found one or two seeds from like four
ounces so the other guy was one that found
[SPEAKER_01]: tk um he's the one that first told us many
many years ago like mid 90s that like he
[SPEAKER_01]: got a hold of craig and he's like hey i
found this killer seed in that batch of
[SPEAKER_01]: ammo triangle that you guys had years ago
couple years ago and popped a couple seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: out of it and i found this super keeper
you guys should check out and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: around the time that he had brought craig
a fresh plant of it that was like just cut
[SPEAKER_01]: down shoved into a brown bag like took a
couple of these off it but there's like
[SPEAKER_01]: stem and everything was in there and i
drove up from jupiter where i was living
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time it was like an hour drive and
went to craig's house and basically
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking i was gonna get some weed to
smoke and it was this wet plant we got we
[SPEAKER_01]: had to split up and then dry it out
ourselves and smoke it so his whole theory
[SPEAKER_01]: was we'll give you a quarter pound we'll
dry it to an ounce and uh me and him me
[SPEAKER_01]: and craig shared it and split it and the
end of just getting fired regardless i was
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking on it when it was still wet like a
little little hits of it in the bind it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just so tasty um and we knew right
away we had to have it but he told us
[SPEAKER_01]: right away that it was it was super skinny
growing it didn't make much and i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: expect much of a yield from it type thing
so that's we went into looking at it like
[SPEAKER_01]: that um so shortly after that happened he
had brought craig some clones of it and i
[SPEAKER_01]: drove up to grab some um and i met the guy
at craig's house a couple times he stood
[SPEAKER_01]: out to me then because he was he was a
tattoo artist and he actually worked in
[SPEAKER_01]: orlando at then cornbread cornbread
ricky's uh tattoo parlor out there in
[SPEAKER_01]: orlando um which i never met those guys so
years later but i met this guy that found
[SPEAKER_01]: a tk seed and he was a tattoo artist and
basically that's i met him at craig's
[SPEAKER_01]: house multiple times and stood out to me
so later when all this stuff came out five
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago um craig and i started talking
and at first craig and all he totally
[SPEAKER_01]: forgot that it was that guy and he was for
some reason thinking it was alex anderson
[SPEAKER_01]: that gave us our cut which i never even
met alex so i had to like refresh his
[SPEAKER_01]: memory and immediately he you know he
thought back and i felt like an idiot
[SPEAKER_01]: because i think he went public a couple of
times and told people came from alex the
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle but it wasn't um so yeah he fixes
he fixed all that in his memory bank and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've we've laughed about it since then
and we've gone over all this stuff but um
[SPEAKER_01]: it was definitely this other guy who
doesn't really want his name to be told
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore and i guess you know for whatever
reasons he's just kind of to himself and
[SPEAKER_05]: quiet so um yeah that's how that went yeah
wow okay so so you actually had the the tk
[SPEAKER_05]: quite early or how long would it have been
after it was found did you get it then it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a couple years i think he i want to
say they found it right afterwards
[SPEAKER_01]: probably around 92 93 92 ish or something
um i don't think i got it so i moved into
[SPEAKER_01]: my house in jupiter in 94 i don't think i
got it till a year after that so 95 96 i
[SPEAKER_05]: think is when i got it yeah me and craig
both interesting okay and then when did
[SPEAKER_05]: you hear about the this you know the og
coach found by alec that was many years
[SPEAKER_01]: later that was uh that wasn't until i
created my first instagram account i kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of went public um and at that point i only
knew about the triangle being related to
[SPEAKER_01]: me um and then my buddy miami mango made a
comment on his posts on instagram at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point i was living in central america kind
of like lane low had a had an art page to
[SPEAKER_01]: sound art and that was the only thing i
had on instagram but then one day i
[SPEAKER_01]: started getting all these random like
cannabis accounts following me for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason i had like 100 new
followers that day and i know why then
[SPEAKER_01]: this goes by miami mango everyone knows
him as i'm sure you know him as that too
[SPEAKER_01]: um i grew up with him in south florida
like going way back to like 11th grade
[SPEAKER_01]: i've known him that long and we saw each
other occasionally here and there and uh
[SPEAKER_01]: he kind of ousted me out one of his posts
talking about triangle push and mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: my art page on his lead page and that's
where i was followers came from so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of how i came out and at first i was
a little bit mad about it you know i was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of eggy um didn't really want to be
part of the scene yet and didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: care for it we were happy living laying
low in central america and uh he talked me
[SPEAKER_01]: into creating an account on instagram and
like you know he's joining in with or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever and causing a ruckus so that was
when i created origin ck and that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing i came up with when i created
the account basically um so it was after
[SPEAKER_01]: that that i started meeting people through
him for example he introduced me to josh d
[SPEAKER_01]: and he told me about the strain that josh
d had called the og kush that he thought
[SPEAKER_01]: was very similar to the triangle push and
that i should maybe meet him and see if we
[SPEAKER_01]: could figure that out so at that point in
time shortly after i created origins josh
[SPEAKER_01]: and i started talking he invited me and my
fiance to california to go visit his farm
[SPEAKER_01]: in santa barbara so shortly after that we
did that and that's when i met josh and we
[SPEAKER_01]: started trading stories and um that's
about the time i started seeing or hearing
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts with alex anderson and talking
about bubba bringing the cut off from him
[SPEAKER_01]: out to florida from florida to california
to josh and you know i did all the
[SPEAKER_01]: research and talking to josh back and
forth that's where i learned more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: about all that um and it wasn't until even
a couple years after all that before we
[SPEAKER_01]: put more pieces together where like alex
anderson finally admitted that the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: came from us because at first he was
making up different stories saying that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was uh there was a plant that died and
somebody that died that had the plant so
[SPEAKER_01]: he kind of like dead ended the story there
you know and then years later it came out
[SPEAKER_01]: on another adam dunn show that my mango
and my buddy craig actually called in on
[SPEAKER_01]: and they started talking to alex in person
it was the creepy episode and on that
[SPEAKER_01]: episode alex was like oh man i didn't want
to say any names or whatever and i was
[SPEAKER_01]: being respectful towards you know the
surfer code and basically he admitted that
[SPEAKER_01]: that seed came from our weed um my weed
from craig basically back in the day wow
[SPEAKER_01]: him coming out and admitting all that just
kind of like put it all you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of the puzzle together i already
know from from josh's side of the story
[SPEAKER_01]: about how um he got the cut from matt
bubba burger who somehow got it from i
[SPEAKER_01]: think there was a story i haven't talked
too much to alex but there's a story on
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the podcasts he talked about or one
of his old roommates that like robbed them
[SPEAKER_01]: at gunpoint for some of their genetic for
something uh and then it was like a mutual
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of him and bubba that had gotten a
hold of those genetics or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that and so bubba had taken them from
there um i guess i guess he was already
[SPEAKER_01]: living in california and he was teamed up
with josh somehow in hollywood and i grew
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're growing a few different things
out there but bubba was like hey i got
[SPEAKER_01]: these genetics in florida and go grab that
we'll just blow this stuff away and he
[SPEAKER_01]: started a Chris plant that he had out here
so he came out to florida and he grabbed a
[SPEAKER_01]: few cuts of it along with a couple other
things they had here and brought them back
[SPEAKER_01]: out to their grow and that's how josh got
a hold of it and that's where the story
[SPEAKER_01]: started in la like at that point it was
only called kush and according to kenji
[SPEAKER_01]: and be real and josh and some other people
involved once it made its way out there it
[SPEAKER_01]: became like super popular because it was
really really good and basically they
[SPEAKER_01]: started touching crazy prices like talking
like 800 dollars an ounce of some some uh
[SPEAKER_01]: predicaments so because of that people
started naming everything kush seeing if
[SPEAKER_01]: they can get higher prices for their stuff
according to josh and these guys um and so
[SPEAKER_01]: because of that they had to change the
name and that's when the og thing started
[SPEAKER_01]: um og being for original and that was josh
and bubba and kenji and a couple other
[SPEAKER_05]: friends and be real is doing basically
like how does it feel to see like the way
[SPEAKER_05]: these two strains have gone on to like
become like top tier lists of every smoker
[SPEAKER_01]: out there oh it's super cool super
humbling for sure i get a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: are super appreciative at all i get a lot
of thank yous all the time and um just
[SPEAKER_01]: really warm welcoming for the most part
you know there's been a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: characters that hasn't run into with
hearing that but for the most part
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's been really cool josh and his
whole time that i met we've become like
[SPEAKER_01]: really close friends since then um he was
actually just visiting my place in central
[SPEAKER_01]: america last week um and he he had a place
down there as well himself for years uh
[SPEAKER_01]: for some just random reason he doesn't
even surf but he has this little house on
[SPEAKER_01]: the beach that me and craig used to go to
as kids like on our first couple surf
[SPEAKER_01]: trips and surf this little random beach um
far from everything and we used to go
[SPEAKER_01]: there to get away from the crowds and josh
just so happens to have a house there so
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a weird coincidence we have a lot
in common um so he was down there with his
[SPEAKER_01]: family and for his wife's birthday and
they visited all my mother area and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically got to check out some
restaurants i stand up with and some
[SPEAKER_05]: hotels and stuff so that's cool yeah shout
out josh d whenever i've um met him at
[SPEAKER_05]: like events he's been super nice guy
always enjoyed hanging out with him so
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely definitely on board with that
and i guess i wanted to quickly ask while
[SPEAKER_05]: we're on the topic because i do want to
get back to the story um you know there's
[SPEAKER_05]: a myriad of og cushions that have all come
out since the originals you know like i
[SPEAKER_05]: guess some of the more famous ones like
you know like the fire og the face of og
[SPEAKER_05]: sfv do you have any favorites or have you
tried most of these ones and what's your
[SPEAKER_05]: thoughts do you think like to a degree
some of them are s1s of others or like
[SPEAKER_01]: where do you see that when i first met
josh um him and a guy named mojave that
[SPEAKER_01]: were at the farm the first day we met
mojave was actually partners with adam
[SPEAKER_01]: dunn and amsterdam and their sea company
years ago so he's a he's like a wealth of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge he's i learned a lot from him
about history and he was actually part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the uh the big holy sir strain i want to
say his family was so he knew a lot um
[SPEAKER_01]: that day at the farm uh basically they
were growing all ogs so that was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time that we got to see og um josh og
ghost og ryan og marathon og he had the tk
[SPEAKER_01]: going he had like a whole two acres of
like all ogs going so i was like a kid in
[SPEAKER_01]: a candy store that day um so we were
walking around checking them all out and
[SPEAKER_01]: like basically he had that patches that
were like three four weeks old and then he
[SPEAKER_01]: had some they're like maybe two three
weeks from being done or something maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: little longer so i got to see a couple
different different phases of them as well
[SPEAKER_01]: but to me at first like our thing at first
was we were trying to figure out if the
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle on the og were basically the same
plant that maybe had mutated over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years this is prior to the whole alex
thing coming out and you know this is five
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago when i first met josh and we had
first started talking so before i met or
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to alec um and you know there are
still a lot of like discrepancies about
[SPEAKER_01]: which cut was which and a lot of people
seem to think they're the same thing but
[SPEAKER_01]: in person you can see there are definitely
height differences and i mean it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar to the to the finger rub but
like once they got a little closer to
[SPEAKER_01]: being done you can see they're definitely
different uh you can see all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: variations according to josh and mojave
that day they claimed that their majority
[SPEAKER_01]: of them the good ones all came from the
same cut and were just renamed over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years and that they grew in different
locations and they might have morphed a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and they'd be a little bit
different than the original so that was
[SPEAKER_01]: our first train of thought um and since
then we've come to realize that for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: the tk and the og are from different seeds
so they're like sisters um and they
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely do grow up side by side they
definitely have a lot of differences to
[SPEAKER_01]: them so yeah we figured that much out
since then um i haven't grown a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of them i've grown a handful i've smoked a
lot of them unfortunately i haven't had a
[SPEAKER_01]: large area facility to like collect and
store a bunch of genetics since all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff started for me like when i first
came out of hiding and was on instagram i
[SPEAKER_01]: was living in central america we had a
small place and then you know i had like a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple little tiny rooms i was able to do
stuff in down there but taking big risks
[SPEAKER_01]: down there you could get in trouble
obviously um and we actually had a home
[SPEAKER_01]: invasion down there too which i'll get it
get to eventually um so yeah there's uh i
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't really had a chance to to properly
grow out all the ogs myself like josh has
[SPEAKER_01]: um like i was more familiar obviously with
the triangle but they grow very similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other um very similar structure very
similar like traits and leaf look and
[SPEAKER_01]: stems and everything they both are a
little bit they like less light than most
[SPEAKER_01]: plants um so yeah those are things that uh
i've come to learn the last few years but
[SPEAKER_01]: about the ogs and stuff you know are
definitely very similar as far as the tpa
[SPEAKER_01]: goes um as far as growing most of them i
would love to i'm i'm looking forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: the day where florida uses up on home grow
and i could have all the ogs in my
[SPEAKER_01]: collection here and get to try them all
myself but as far as favorites go that
[SPEAKER_01]: other than the original og and the tk i've
had a really good bag of face off that was
[SPEAKER_01]: insane um i've also had some crosses that
were made with that in costa rica from sea
[SPEAKER_01]: that i like a lot a couple other ones i
had down there from like archive that were
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses with his uh his face off recently
more recently we had a z face we went
[SPEAKER_01]: through here a bunch of um genetics or a
bunch of seeds of it and found some real
[SPEAKER_01]: nice gassy a couple skittles type ones um
so definitely i like the face off i've
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely the first time i actually seen
um any of the ogs on that trip i ran into
[SPEAKER_01]: josh was actually a san fernando valley
that my friend had in santa cruz um that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually reminded me of the triangle when
i first saw it um and i've smoked fire og
[SPEAKER_01]: the marathon og um pretty much everything
like josh's brown i've had and tried yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful stuff beautiful stuff so there
