[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Ken morrow of trichrome
technologies for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you inviting me and having me
as a guest The pleasure is all mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you having you on and I guess
The question I'd love to ask you as we do
[SPEAKER_00]: all guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, so I live in northern,
California, so I've got quite a A laundry
[SPEAKER_01]: list of availability so to speak a friend
of mine runs a company called Yosemite
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis company and he grows all organic
outdoor cannabis and so I enjoy getting
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm smoking at the moment
That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you more of an Indica or Steve?
[SPEAKER_01]: a guy Depends on the time of day,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean is a More than sativa or Indica
nomenclature or classifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have You know, I like high cannabinoid
cannabinoid contents at night low
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in the middle of the day and
in the early parts of the morning and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you know getting into my favorite Terpene
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like beta-carafale and I love black
pepper and there's certain terpenes That I
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of seek out in the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more so than the sativa Indica
references.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I look for chemical ratios, you know
That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the the breakdown even just as you
said, you know High cannabinoid in the
[SPEAKER_00]: evening lower in the day I just want to
quickly follow up that comment about the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes first Do you feel like you
gravitate more towards terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: than say any other individual aspect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because of the flavor and the smell
is probably Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll even say 50% of the pleasure I gained
from cannabis or hashish either one so
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always you know, besides just the
high I enjoyed the different flavors and
[SPEAKER_01]: nuances and smells and That that part of
it fascinates me and that gets into
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical ratios and differences of
terpenes That's really what differentiates
[SPEAKER_01]: one from another as well as you know
sulfur based thiols and a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals Yeah, certainly and look let's
let's pause the files there for a second
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want to come back but I want to
quickly ask you first because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to a few grower friends the other
day and They asked me they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you hear people talking about
terpenes bit of cariophylline You know
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like pepper as you mentioned things
like that and they sort of said I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if I've got like my base palette down
in a sense They were like people talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about Miracene for example and you can
often hear quite widely varying
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions of what it smells like and
you know, I think in a sense it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: for some people it can just come down to
you need someone to like Put a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of your face and say this is what a
Miracene dominant plant smells like or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that So my question to you
is how would you advise people to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop their nose if for example They
don't have someone who can be like here's
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant and it smells exactly like
terpenaline or you know How can people
[SPEAKER_00]: start to get that reference down?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recently wrote an article that
basically addressed that subject And and
[SPEAKER_01]: so more so than you know saying by buying
a bottle of pure piney and mime anion or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever have you You know, what is your
favorite cannabis and and go analyze that
[SPEAKER_01]: send that to a lab or you know,
there's there's so many lab reports
[SPEAKER_01]: available in other countries where it's
legalized the try to find a library report
[SPEAKER_01]: that tells you what what is the terpene
ratio in your favorite cultivar and you
[SPEAKER_01]: might find that there is a dominant
terpene and or a few and and that would Be
[SPEAKER_01]: a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I explained to people that you know,
there's something called like a wine
[SPEAKER_01]: journal or a wine diary if you were to go
to a famous wine region and buy a given
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle of wine, you know, maybe there was
a something that fascinated you or or made
[SPEAKER_01]: you prefer that and And you would write it
in your journal and then when you got home
[SPEAKER_01]: after a while you would start seeing some
similarities You know, maybe it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain mixture of merlot and cabernet or
maybe it was french oak Maybe it was
[SPEAKER_01]: American oak or those outside influences
that really make up the totality of that
[SPEAKER_01]: wine after a while, you'll find a
preference, you know what I mean something
[SPEAKER_01]: that you prefer, you know a 60-40 ratio of
a cavernet merlot or again French oak
[SPEAKER_01]: versus American oak or you know,
you'll you'll you'll probably find that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's Characteristics that you prefer
and I believe that's to be the same in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, you know, so so Find the
cannabis that you find the most appealing
[SPEAKER_01]: and then try to find the characteristics
that are in the contents of that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the dominant terpene?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the the the the the cannabinoid
ratios?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have to CBC or THCV or you know,
what what what are the nuances figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: the nuances and then try to find similar
and like strains or cultivars if you will
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and perhaps that's that's the path
Yeah, that sounds fantastic, you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: follow what you're interested in and
that's gonna give you some answers and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many little avenues you just
you spoke about that we need to follow up
[SPEAKER_00]: on but I guess the one that I'm most
interested in talking to you about is you
[SPEAKER_00]: reference wine a few times in that answer
and I wanted to ask you to what degree do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think we will see a mirroring of say
elements of the wine industry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, you know people often
talk about they want to establish these
[SPEAKER_00]: production Appalachians and Really
promoting the terroir of certain regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this point we sadly aren't
there yet You know like the majority of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the highest quality Production is
generally considered indoors though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a vocal group of people who was
very, you know Big about supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think we'll come to see in the
coming 15 to 20 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: That will mirror the wine industry in
cannabis Well, there's there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: misconceptions there and and you know,
where will where will it end up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it'll end up just where I said
people will have preferential cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios be it you know similar to be it CBD
and THC ratios akin to Cabernet and Merlot
[SPEAKER_01]: levels or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I once seen a comic and and and it
depicted a gentleman on the phone to his
[SPEAKER_01]: local grow store and he was placing his
order so to speak and and he ordered one
[SPEAKER_01]: bag of Humboldt County terroir and one bag
of Mendocino terroir and I just I still
[SPEAKER_01]: find that funny as hell because if you
really get into terroir and and and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, there's Appalachians Appalachian
There there's a you know other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: denote where a wine is produced but when
you get into terroir a wine grape in a
[SPEAKER_01]: given Appalachian There there's no outside
influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no nutrient application.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no you know Influences that the
the cannabis has cannabis has nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: applications a wine grape doesn't so you
know to truly say that you're extolling
[SPEAKER_01]: the the properties of an Appalachian of a
given region of a cannabis plant would be
[SPEAKER_01]: to plant it in the dirt water only and
never give it food and that's never going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know then then you get into the
environmental aspects of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it a region a foggy region is a rocky
region Iron Ridge and those other outside
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental influences are really what
makes up the characteristics of the final
[SPEAKER_01]: product more so than a so-called terroir,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because because it terroir isn't really
appropriate term the second you add
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients or amendments to the soil
because that's not what happens in grapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Yeah, certainly certainly and I
think I have come across a few farms at
[SPEAKER_00]: least on Instagram on face value who say
they're trying to do that even a few who
[SPEAKER_00]: go so far as to say they're trying to do
like dry farms farming and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like just natural rain only but it does
remain to be seen if it's like actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: viable option and then Maybe you could
start to assess if there is some degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir there You mentioned in the last
answer that your friend was growing some
[SPEAKER_00]: organic outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to ask all the guests What's your
preferred style of growing if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your choice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like an indoor cocoa and salts guy
you an outdoor organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your preferred setup if you had
your choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hybrid supplemental lighting in a
greenhouse I have Been fortunate enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: meet some of the largest commercial tomato
growers in the world that do so with no
[SPEAKER_01]: Compromise of quality so to speak,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just not spitting out
flavorless tomatoes and in fact He handed
[SPEAKER_01]: me a tomato from his greenhouse one time
and I kid you not to this day It is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best damn tomato I ever tasted,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just because he's my friend
or I prefer his methodologies but it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fact and and you know, it's a you know,
he's in Not really using supplemental
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting because he's in a preferential
location But if I was going to be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: preferential location I would use
supplemental lighting for cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in a greenhouse large-scale
commercial Yeah, I wanted to ask you about
[SPEAKER_00]: that because you know, you're you're well
known especially You know in in sort of 10
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years ago for being a pioneer of like
scaling up commercial cultivation Tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit about what it's like to grow
on the sort of scale you're referring to
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think both myself and many of
our listeners Probably, you know for
[SPEAKER_00]: better or worse kid ourselves at times and
think oh, you know, I've I've got mastery
[SPEAKER_00]: of this tent I could do a greenhouse,
you know What are some of the issues you
[SPEAKER_00]: come across on scale that just simply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't present on the the smaller hobby
level Well, keep in mind when I was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: those commercial Cultivations that you
were talking about that were so famous and
[SPEAKER_01]: fluid in those magazines I was facing a 20
to 5 the life sentence because prop 215
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't even enacted let alone prop 64 So
it was just all illegal, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, you know Even going back as far
as when I did 60 minutes television show
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1996 I had already been arrested in
1993 and was facing 25 the life of I got
[SPEAKER_01]: caught doing that interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was the mindset, you know It
wasn't I didn't go large and and do those
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial levels out of you know money or
you know what what what ended up was To to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do a lot of plants and when
especially when you're breeding I've bred
[SPEAKER_01]: over 200 different cultivars so when you
start breeding that much and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: taking that many clones By default your
plant go count just skyrockets you end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with two thousand four thousand and then
if you got four thousand What's six?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's no really, you know,
25 years or 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean, so, you know,
but then after a while it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the The cultivation techniques
and the information available,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, especially when there was no
real internet so to speak I mean there was
[SPEAKER_01]: but there there there wasn't as free and
open as it is today as far as marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation Information or anything else
so it was still books and papers and it
[SPEAKER_01]: and magazines, etc so, you know,
you know, it was just to answer my own
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, you know what happens if and
scaling up and and you know those NFT
[SPEAKER_01]: systems that I built and then you know,
okay Well, NFT does this that and the
[SPEAKER_01]: other thing with Rockwell then what about
fog ponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you know, organic amendments,
you know because you know, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: salts versus Organics, it's it's you know,
very hard to get organics to go through a
[SPEAKER_01]: drip system and not end up clogging it,
you know, so so then Inevitably you end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with two if you're you know, I'm trying to
incorporate organic amendments you end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with the drip system and hand watering
over the top with your organic amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can get include those etc,
but I think I went off track with my
[SPEAKER_00]: answers, but No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives such colorful context to your
your story and we're certainly going to
[SPEAKER_00]: loop back in and cover, you know
chronologically your journey because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so interesting but I guess one thing I
still wanted to hunt down from that last
[SPEAKER_00]: question was what are some of the
challenges you face on scale when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing thousands of plants versus say
maybe you know 80 to 100 at home in a room
[SPEAKER_01]: Skilled labor and time, you know what I
mean beyond able to manage everything
[SPEAKER_01]: especially You know if you're the one
paying the bills, you know get physically
[SPEAKER_01]: going down to pay the PG&E bills Etc,
etc if you are the one physically doing
[SPEAKER_01]: deliveries of the product to the
dispensary if you're the one procuring
[SPEAKER_01]: materials to you know Continue the
process, you know, if you're a one-man
[SPEAKER_01]: show, there's a one-man show There's only
a so many hours in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it was illegal activity You know,
you had to watch who be very mindful of
[SPEAKER_01]: who you trusted Now that it's legal you
there's there there's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's unions there's there's you know
There's a you know legitimate places to
[SPEAKER_01]: hire skilled labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's college courses being
given now it errors, you know multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: colleges in the United States So it's it's
much easier to get labor Skilled labor
[SPEAKER_01]: should I say and and and much easier to
deal with an illegal entity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, certainly I mean did you were you
able to get any help back in the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it the case that you just had to do
everything yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I had a handful of very good friends I
wouldn't be where I am today without all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those friends and and you know There
there were some of them that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't here today that were you know,
invaluable and stuff I had a Japanese
[SPEAKER_01]: gentleman named Noboru Zaha that has
passed away from kidney disease not too
[SPEAKER_01]: long ago that was you know Basically,
you know, he was a tried-true soldier,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, you know, there was a
little bit of a language barrier But one
[SPEAKER_01]: time he asked me so I you know I should
shoot at him if they come in here and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like shoot at who?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like at the police that the police
comes here I should shoot at him and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like no No, you do not shoot at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have a gun Don't do any of that
stuff, you know, it was like but yeah The
[SPEAKER_01]: level of dedication was very impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I had I had a handful of friends
actually a big handful of friends some 59
[SPEAKER_01]: years old and throughout my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of friends Wow,
that's that's incredible and it must speak
[SPEAKER_00]: to your own character to have had so many
friends over your time and shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: your Your friend who passed away recently
sounds like a real OG the sort of guy
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd want on your team So let's let's go
back a little bit and and roll this out in
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of order So tell me you know,
what was your first grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you first start growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: My first started growing when I was a just
turned 13 years old a friend across the
[SPEAKER_01]: street his dad It was a dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just cut the tail end of say the the
hippie era the the the the hash trails and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I cut the very end of the red
Lebanese and the blonde Lebanese and the
[SPEAKER_01]: the the Panamanian and and you know just
started, you know the 80s began the influx
[SPEAKER_01]: of the black Afghanistan hash that was
lower quality but I got to experience a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the end of the the era so to speak
and it kind of fascinated me that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: people went to prison and and and put
their lives on the line for this plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and I Grew up I was born and raised
in Napa Valley and wine country and then
[SPEAKER_01]: lived in other agricultural based
communities So I knew you know plant
[SPEAKER_01]: production and plant growth and stuff and
new kids So, you know lived their life off
[SPEAKER_01]: farming and so, you know, my mom had
cuttings in the the the the kitchen window
[SPEAKER_01]: like anybody else that rooted and stuff
And things and my parents worked for the
[SPEAKER_01]: government and they didn't really want me
out and about Doing you know illegal grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the the the the Surrounding areas
so they preferred that I do it at home So
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to at a very young age grow in
the backyard So, you know I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know get Colombian marijuana seeds and
plant them and see them grow and fail and
[SPEAKER_01]: fall over and not enough light and trials
and tribulations there was no books there
[SPEAKER_01]: was no information and if there was no one
going To sell it to a little kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Then I seen an ad in high times
that offered something called a hydro pot
[SPEAKER_01]: and it sounded magic So, you know,
so I bought that and it was basically a
[SPEAKER_01]: bus boys tray It's in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a picture of me standing there
next to it a bus boys trade with a lava
[SPEAKER_01]: rock in it with the air stone bubbler and
it came with a little packet of miracle
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and Yeah, it worked it grew and and
that as a 13 year old kid sparked my
[SPEAKER_01]: fascination with hydroponics and Cannabis
growth and everything related and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I was telling some of the other day
I can distinctly remember and could take
[SPEAKER_01]: you to today the exact spot where I was
standing when I seen seedless cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: what we would know today is it just
Completely fascinated me as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time I seen a concentrate in 1980 a
hash oil concentrate that was of par today
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about both of those, you know,
what was that first herb you saw that was
[SPEAKER_00]: sensi Did it have a name or I'm guessing
it was just back at the time where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the kind or something and also
tell us about that concentrate and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: a Well both happened about 1980 a new guy
moved into town And he brought this
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and showed it to me and it had
these it had a when it did have a seed it
[SPEAKER_01]: was huge it was like, you know to me it
looked like a Watermelon, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was absolutely huge with these
jagged black lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was completely different than any kind
of Sativa or thin-leafed cultivar seed
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had ever seen it was just this
gargantuan seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you Very rarely got one the go the
the person that sold us the pot ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: telling us He'll give us 25 seed to buy
him back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Anyway, I asked that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd you get that and he you know,
and can you get more and he said yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: he could get more and because when I was
young I I was a have always been
[SPEAKER_01]: trustworthy so older and and and kind of
Hung out with older kids One of my best
[SPEAKER_01]: friends was, you know almost twice my age
And and so my mom would let me go hang out
[SPEAKER_01]: with them and stay as long as like I stand
out of trouble You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean then so, you know so knowing him I
was you know afforded the luxury of seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of different cannabis and stuff like
that So when the new kid came to town and
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked him if he could get more of it I
knew adults that sold cannabis So I knew
[SPEAKER_01]: if he could get more that those adults
would want that cannabis So he said yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: he could get more and there was a school
program Occupational program for auto
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanics and and it took you like three
towns away and you went to their auto shop
[SPEAKER_01]: and you learned all day and then you came
back to your town and so that Town was the
[SPEAKER_01]: same town that he could get the marijuana
So I said well, let's get on that bus and
[SPEAKER_01]: let's go to that town and let's get that
marijuana and we went there and we got a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound and this is in what ninth grade and
your grade nine, whatever you want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: and then from there we went to You know
got got fronted a pound took it to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend Bodie's house and said here look
and he went how much for that we said
[SPEAKER_01]: $2,200 and he said okay boom and so we got
it for 2,000 we kept 200 each hundred each
[SPEAKER_01]: and and Brought the the the main guy the
money back and started doing that at like
[SPEAKER_01]: 9th grade you know and None of the adults
knew where this stuff was coming from but
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just from me and him and his
connection to his dad's friend and then
[SPEAKER_01]: one day a guy named Russ Dahmer came over
my house and he had some what he called
[SPEAKER_01]: hash oil and He said do you want to buy
some of this for $25 a gram which was a
[SPEAKER_01]: very high price back then and again 1980
and before that Sorry, this is a three
[SPEAKER_01]: four pipes part story I had a childhood
friend and and maybe he didn't tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: truth all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stretched the truth quite a bit About
fishing and all kinds of stuff and he came
[SPEAKER_01]: over one day and he's got a brown paper
bag full of marijuana And it was like hey
[SPEAKER_01]: Phil, where'd you get the better
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: He is like it was by my trash and it was
like so and we lived in a small again
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural town and so The probability
of someone sneaking marijuana on your
[SPEAKER_01]: trash back in 1980 when that could be a
felony a felony amount of marijuana on
[SPEAKER_01]: your trash It just didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like yeah, sure So, you know
rolled a joint of this and smoked it and
[SPEAKER_01]: got nothing but a headache It was like
wow, this is terrible and it's like maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: if you smoke a bunch more of it It'll be
okay and it wasn't and so we didn't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: more that and so a couple weeks later He
came back with another brown paper bag and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, you know, it wasn't buds It was
just all all ground up and it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: what's with this, you know didn't couldn't
couldn't figure it out and then his older
[SPEAKER_01]: brother one day was sleeping and there was
a banging on the door and He went to the
[SPEAKER_01]: door and it was the neighbor and the
neighbor said can I put something in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garage?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said I don't care and went back to
bed and then a couple hours later There
[SPEAKER_01]: was more banging on the door He went to
the door flung the door open in the local
[SPEAKER_01]: police department or sitting there and
he's like I didn't do nothing and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like We know you didn't do anything
Randall get your pants on and come outside
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went outside and he could see Dolly
marks from the neighbor's house going to
[SPEAKER_01]: his house And then he looked over at the
neighbor's house and the neighbor's house
[SPEAKER_01]: is on fire in there They're they're
cutting a hole in the roof and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: that out the firemen are there and stuff
So he opens his garage door and inside is
[SPEAKER_01]: a wooden crates full of psilocybin
mushrooms and the other wooden crates are
[SPEAKER_01]: full of honey oil and he said that's not
mine and They said yeah, we know that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not yours Randall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so apparently the hash oil
that I got and the horrible Marijuana by
[SPEAKER_01]: the trash came from the neighbors that
were making honey oil back in the day I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting right next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you what year what address
exactly where this was I was someday want
[SPEAKER_01]: to go find a police report so I can go and
This is an odd tale So I was told that the
[SPEAKER_01]: person was out of Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yeah a guy named Phil or Philip and
supposedly Australian And again,
[SPEAKER_01]: why would he be doing this in that
location way back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But When I first sampled that first
concentrate, I mean it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll black nasty hash oil It was a
golden you could read through it amber
[SPEAKER_01]: flavorful Strong as hell for a kid Hash
oil that was every bit worth of $25 a gram
[SPEAKER_01]: and I spent I spent 25 to 30 years trying
to find something of that quality and
[SPEAKER_01]: never found it until today modern Extracts
became available so to speak Wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean what it what a testament to the
quality of the extract that was being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in like the 80s Like how why do
you think and how do you think he got the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge to be so ahead of the curve?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think it was just you know It wasn't a
super knowledge or anything else with the
[SPEAKER_01]: basic chemistry degree and and
availability of the chemistry I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: probably what he was doing was a quick
wash with with ether and and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the Evaporation of the ether out in
the backyard, you know and and hence
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where the fire came from and what
it all went to hell But I don't think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was anything sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no no glassware.
[SPEAKER_01]: No lab or anything else I think it was
just take marijuana soak it in ether and
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporate the ether real quick without you
know Just letting it soak too long and
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up any any kind of chlorophylls or
sugars or fats or waxes and I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just a quick wash Wow, that's cool to hear
and I guess you know, the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: follow-up is a lot of people very
Reminiscently remember their first dab or
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate hit was that the experience
you had it went straight to my pleasure
[SPEAKER_01]: center years and people in and addicts and
Rehabilitation talking about their drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: of choice and how it just went to their
their their core their their nerve center
[SPEAKER_01]: their brain It was again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't Just the the high it was the
flavor and the smell and and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: about it You know just that that it
resonated with me and that became my drug
[SPEAKER_01]: of choice, even though I had no
availability of it Yeah, well look I
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly as you were saying that I went
back to the first dab I ever took and it
[SPEAKER_00]: does right it hits you in that Primordial
part of our lizard brain as they say but
[SPEAKER_00]: um while we're on the topic we had a fan
submit a question which was that They said
[SPEAKER_00]: oh look, I'd love to hear a little bit
about the evolution of extraction from K
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe a little bit of a rundown on his
current methodology of how he makes
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts so like I can give My perspective
from my bubble in northern, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So You know there there was a book called
cannabis alchemy or or marijuana chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: by Starks or David Hoy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That talked about isomerization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the same book with different covers
and you know slight differences And and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the first book I ever seen that
talked about Concentrates and and before
[SPEAKER_01]: there that there was a red oil comic book
that talked about and I still have these
[SPEAKER_01]: things That talked about a red oil that
the government had made and then I got the
[SPEAKER_01]: the government brochure on their red oil
Which is basically just you know raw dirty
[SPEAKER_01]: black hash oils So I Got the book and the
book said, you know to basically get
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis grinded up put it through a
Cheesecloth and press it into a apply heat
[SPEAKER_01]: and next to a fire and and and twisted in
a ball And it was obviously from someone
[SPEAKER_01]: looking over the shoulder of someone that
didn't speak the language Didn't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: questions ask or didn't know what was
taking place there So so it was convoluted
[SPEAKER_01]: all I got was a ground up ball of
marijuana You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it certainly wasn't had and so but I
didn't understand anything about like
[SPEAKER_01]: resin glue lands, etc, you know,
it was just dipping into the Era of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mid 80s were you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California was breeding good
genetics with high resin contents before
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was imported pressed You know,
you never seen the trichome kind of sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing, you know, so once I started
producing high resin content plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: Then started breeding and then as I said
the numbers climbed exponentially with
[SPEAKER_01]: with with the rise in the amount of
cannabis there was a rise in the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: waste and you're looking at this trim with
all this good resin on it and Asking
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, what do I do with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so, you know after a while I
started taking it put it in the you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not drying it trimming it wet putting it
in the freezer and then Getting silk
[SPEAKER_01]: screens on a big big bowl and then just
slightly slightly swirling them before
[SPEAKER_01]: they would defrost and then dumping it in
Doing that like for 12 hours straight and
[SPEAKER_01]: and the resulting powder that I got was
the most incredible Dry sift that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: personally ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that right there became a fascination
of mine was you know how to make dry seed
[SPEAKER_01]: hash and you know, that was probably and
1989 You know and then I started you know
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to automate it with vibrating
bottles boxes and things trying to scale
[SPEAKER_01]: it up and things but it never really came
out as well as I could get with a Fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen hand trim, you know, so that that
became my focus for quite some time then
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then after that, you know, I just
started, you know again bigger screens
[SPEAKER_01]: more cannabis You know scaling up scaling
up and at that point you were just doing
[SPEAKER_01]: hand pressing and stuff and things later
on things Like Mila Jensen produced a
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinator which automated things but only
had one size working screen you had to
[SPEAKER_01]: refine and clean the resulting product
after that and then so, you know that that
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrapped my head and you know got fairly
good at dry seeding and and Me I wrote an
[SPEAKER_01]: article and it was edited and cleaned up
so to speak and co-authored by Mel Frank
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my heroes and and someone I respect
immensely and so that was Probably that
[SPEAKER_01]: was in the year 2000 and it was basically
that they told how to do dry sieve And
[SPEAKER_01]: that was for high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I had gotten a piece of
paper in 1994 from Someone that got let's
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the piece of paper I got from Ed
Rosenthal who got from Neville Sean Mocker
[SPEAKER_01]: from from super seed to seed club and He
got that document from Sadhu Sam or Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: the skunk man and basically this document
one page document It's on my Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: page.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the the original document
there and it was originally sold in high
[SPEAKER_01]: times magazine as an instruction and So it
basically said take cannabis put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: blender blend it gently quickly and then
Sieve out the the floating part and
[SPEAKER_01]: collect the sinking part in a coffee
filter and basically that was the the
[SPEAKER_01]: early stage information and early stage of
water hash technology and so from there I
[SPEAKER_01]: You know try to scale it up then,
you know did did you know ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: stupid things?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like, you know used a paint stirrer
to try to You know, you know, so you got a
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiller instead of using ice to drop your
temperature of your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got fresh frozen material in there and
You're trying to keep it the resin gland
[SPEAKER_01]: solidified but trying to separate it
without Using the bulk of ice and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: damage of ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it made sense to like try a
Paint stir which was far too aggressive
[SPEAKER_01]: and and put far too much particulate into
them And into the the final product etc,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know I had no sources of
information and and so this is how I you
[SPEAKER_01]: know went through the process of
elimination of what worked and what didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in the in the end you would just
use the water chiller no ice enhanced or
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know, and and so but I was doing
fresh frozen, you know way before it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: term or or being utilized and So that
article also went into the same article
[SPEAKER_01]: with Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It taught you how to dry sieve and it also
taught you how to water hash but in the
[SPEAKER_01]: year 2000 and those are both on my
Instagram page, you know, you can see what
[SPEAKER_01]: what Year what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Issue, you know everything I say I've got
published proof of kind of sort of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and at that point there wasn't Water bags
or or you know any of those products So I
[SPEAKER_01]: just told how to do it without those
products and those products came out very
[SPEAKER_01]: soon after and you know took off And it
exploded from from there, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still fascinated by those those I
loved dry sieve hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong water hash secondary
But I but I absolutely loved that original
[SPEAKER_01]: oil and I wanted to get back to that I'd
had oil since but it was all chlorophyll a
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty black some nasty extraction and
certainly wasn't close to the original
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had So then I started asking myself
how to do that da da da da da so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that gets into You know,
it's fairly, you know roto vapes and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry I had the luxury of meeting a
gentleman that was doing roto vapes with
[SPEAKER_01]: ether on the hillsides of Kabul
Afghanistan in 1983 and boy, that's some
[SPEAKER_01]: some hair-raising stuff Funny story there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were from Berkeley and and one of
them had a chemistry degree So they went
[SPEAKER_01]: to Kabul and they were shipping all their
their materials there their roto vapes
[SPEAKER_01]: their their ether Etc, etc and they said
one time that the the winter times get
[SPEAKER_01]: very very cold there and so their ether
was in the basement and and so someone
[SPEAKER_01]: went down to the basement and somehow they
sparked off a The the cans of ether had
[SPEAKER_01]: condensed because of the cold and vapors
had filled the basement So when they went
[SPEAKER_01]: down to the basement, they sparked off
this explosion and it blew You know all
[SPEAKER_01]: the windows out started a fire and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody rushed down the hill and they
went to the local coffee restaurant down
[SPEAKER_01]: in the flatlands so they could sit there
and stare at their house burning after a
[SPEAKER_01]: while it went out and nothing really
happened but they noticed like people were
[SPEAKER_01]: walking by and staring at him and stuff
until they finally stared at each other
[SPEAKER_01]: and they realized all their hair was
singed in their eyebrows and Everybody had
[SPEAKER_01]: looked like they had been burned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pretty dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the Soviets came the Soviets
came in and they stopped doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: another funny story they told me it was
like On one side of the valley they had
[SPEAKER_01]: their lab and and so and on the other side
they they had their their source so one
[SPEAKER_01]: day the source shows up at their spot and
he's kind of watching what's going on and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's kind of dismayed and They're like
what's wrong and he was like see your guys
[SPEAKER_01]: there and he's like, yeah He's like
they've got these huge bricks of hash and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're they're they're scraping them over
screens so they could Particulate it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean and expose the
surface area for extraction for ether,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know And he's like you see on the
other side of the valley and he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, and he's like I have my guys over
there pressing it into those those blocks
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like he's like, you mean you could
just give it to us and in gunny sack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just raw resin He was like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah save us both a bunch of time So I
found that amusing but but I didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do ether, you know That time early in
the days ether was a very forbidden
[SPEAKER_01]: Substance because it was used utilized in
the the manufacturing of methamphetamine
[SPEAKER_01]: So in California, it probably wouldn't be
a good idea to go out there running around
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to buy ether So and and plus I'm
not a fan of the flammability of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: etc, etc So that wasn't the path I wanted
to take Or or even ethanol and rotovapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems so backwards, you know and
and and the distillate that Produced just
[SPEAKER_01]: really did nothing to fancy me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene content was destroyed,
etc, etc by the heat so from there A
[SPEAKER_01]: friend was talking about the the
petrochemical companies how they utilize
[SPEAKER_01]: something called a cracker and how they
utilize that to make petroleum and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically what he explained was a tube
that you push butane through and Then very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly after that you started seeing
stuff in the Bay Area called wax From ear
[SPEAKER_01]: wax because it was all brown and looked
like ear wax and it was all sticky and
[SPEAKER_01]: nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a horrible term But that stuck,
you know later on well, we'll get to that
[SPEAKER_01]: but uh, so so then people started making
the the butane extracts and stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: Pushing it through, you know, they didn't
know any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote an article for red eye magazine
called captain butane I didn't write it I
[SPEAKER_01]: told Nick how to write it but it
basically, you know told you know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the nasty process of pushing butane
through a PVC pipe, you know, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: revolutionary for the time You know,
you know later We learned that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a bomb and it's poison and you
shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until then it made some fancy product
so, you know people started doing that but
[SPEAKER_01]: very quickly it started to getting into
closed-loop systems and and the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: shifted gears before this the Glass bong
makers were about to go out of business
[SPEAKER_01]: because nobody wanted a glass bong With
the invent of dabs and the dab rig It
[SPEAKER_01]: reinvigorated so many industries the
cannabis industry did it took off like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen before I remember the
first time showing Mel Frank a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cup in Los Angeles and You know one day
they were smoking weed the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were smoking dabs It was just that
fast and they've got blowtorches and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just like what in the fuck is going on
here He was just blown away as well as I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember in Richmond, California walking
through into the craneway pavilion with
[SPEAKER_01]: Miele Johnson the first time she seen the
whole dab scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just blew her mind, you know,
I mean, it was just you know It was just
[SPEAKER_01]: it was overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just it just exploded then
But before that I started in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: culture with Dana Larson and Mark Emory I
read a small little quote about somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: making something in Canada called butter
B-U-D-D-E-R I later learned his name and
[SPEAKER_01]: spoke with the gentleman He was
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very kind and told me everything
that I answered all my questions and told
[SPEAKER_01]: me exactly what he was doing at the time
and basically he was doing a quick alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: wash and then collecting the residual and
and evaporating the alcohol and whipping
[SPEAKER_01]: the final concentrate into something that
he termed butter and it was bright Colored
[SPEAKER_01]: not dark in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was absolutely fascinating and and so
Combined that butter with also a Let's
[SPEAKER_01]: call it open blast article that I wrote
for high times was called the art and
[SPEAKER_01]: science cleaning concentrates part one and
part two Part one was all about the quick
[SPEAKER_01]: wash and how to make butter part two was
all about you know how to do you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I introduced the term thin layer
evaporation and winterization and Vacuum
[SPEAKER_01]: drying oven to the industry in that
article, you know, nobody was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about these terms But you know from you
know, they were just open blasting but now
[SPEAKER_01]: you take the open blast you add ethanol
then you wait for the Butane to dissipate
[SPEAKER_01]: then then you're able to now take that put
it in a freezer winterize it solidify any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the undesirables the lipids the fats
the waxes and all that kind of stuff Then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to filter it through a coffee
filter and get a much cleaner purified
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentrate and so then after that I seen
a ad for a video That was called medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: alchemy calm and it offered a video and I
later Was introduced met the person
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for it and it was an
interesting little video and an
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting little method, but it
basically Shows you how to take a 2-liter
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle take the top introduce a Valve to
be able to introduce butane put your
[SPEAKER_01]: product in the 2-liter plastic bottle
introduce your butane shake it around then
[SPEAKER_01]: then filter that out into a another vessel
glass vessel and then introduce your your
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol and then winterize and then he was
spreading it out on a glass sheet and and
[SPEAKER_01]: letting it slowly evaporate and then
scraping it with it methodically scraping
[SPEAKER_01]: it with a razor blade and and coming up
with a you know, a Almost clear
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate what fascinated me most was
when I heard him drop that that piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate onto a glass dish It made a
pinging sound telling me it was hard like
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't Anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard like a glass So then this
video said that it could show you show you
[SPEAKER_01]: how to make butter and glass and shatter
and things and So it was fascinating to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, once I got behind the
curtain and seen the rudimentary
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies Then it made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like oh, wait a minute there
There's got to be ways to scale this up
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know basically with the closed
loop then then you get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: winterization aspect of it and then you
know the utilization of a vacuum drying
[SPEAKER_01]: oven, you know instead of drying it on a
piece of glass and you know, then then I
[SPEAKER_01]: taught myself all these things that I
contacted across international who made
[SPEAKER_01]: the vacuum drying oven and said hey,
I You know, I'm contaminating my oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: things are going awry and then and got one
of their technicians who was about to quit
[SPEAKER_01]: on the phone and he said oh what you want
to do is you want to upgrade your plumbing
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to do this you want to do that
blah blah blah blah and then I said well
[SPEAKER_01]: in your Literature somewhere that mentions
this thing, you know And he was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh we don't sell those and he's like but
here's where to get one, you know So,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I went and got this apparatus
and I attached it to my vacuum drying oven
[SPEAKER_01]: in between the oven and the pump and It
would it would build up with ice and then
[SPEAKER_01]: so when I tried to because of the moisture
and so the residual moisture from the
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol left in the the the concentrate
From the winterization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I tried to get that out It would
contaminate my pump oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put this device in and when I went to
drain the device I got hit In the face
[SPEAKER_01]: with the smell of terpene so very very
strong and it was like, oh wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: wait, wait Maybe you don't want to throw
that away So I started methodically
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting it over and over and over and
over and over again And then after that I
[SPEAKER_01]: put it into the the ice I let it melt and
then I put it into graduated cylinders
[SPEAKER_01]: then so I was able to with the the
graduated cylinders let a layer thin layer
[SPEAKER_01]: of essence oil float to the top and
separate the essence oil from the top from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Hydrosols and separate the two and so,
you know, I basically taught myself how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do Terpene isolation and then it made
sense that it's like well I could do that
[SPEAKER_01]: with a fresh frozen flower and capture all
the terpenes or or or hops or any other
[SPEAKER_01]: plant material I could take that and
collect the essences that are typically
[SPEAKER_01]: lost to the drying process or that are
lost during the the the recapture of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrocarbon in a closed-loop system and so
I could capture all those those terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and So and you know put them in a bottle
unlike ever before and so that that that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of fascinated me right there and then
so Then you know looping back in today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just finished article I write for
cannabis business times and somebody wrote
[SPEAKER_01]: a question saying that they expected a
Much larger harvest this year than they
[SPEAKER_01]: have room to dry it and so there's you
know technology and apparatus is that some
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know about that are available right
now like something called the cryo mass,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a Liquid nitrogen freezes the
cannabis the cannabis goes into a
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibrating sieve and the sieve separates
the resin gland from the active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients from the undesirable green
vegetative material call it biomass So it
[SPEAKER_01]: can do this by the tongue You know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you so it eliminates that you don't
have to dry the cannabis don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: cure the cannabis don't have to hand trim
the cannabis don't have to have a place to
[SPEAKER_01]: store it by a whole bunch of Dehumidifiers
or any of the stuff or employ the hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: people to trim this or anything else you
take the the wet fresh frozen plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material and you separate the desirable
material from the undesirable material and
[SPEAKER_01]: then after that you put it through a
static apparatus that separates the any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of particulate that went through or
any kind of trichrome stocks or immature
[SPEAKER_01]: glands It separates the undesirable resin
from the desirable resin, but it does so
[SPEAKER_01]: and the desirable resin still has multiple
sizes So after the the static separation
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll go back into a vortice with
multiple screens and then you can separate
[SPEAKER_01]: by Size and and so then you got Whatever
size desired, you know Trichome size
[SPEAKER_01]: separated that you want so that that right
there is how I believe because now you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got the the resin gland and a 55 gallon
drum And that you can press it into rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do hydrocarbon and you can do
ethanol extracts you can use it as just an
[SPEAKER_01]: active ingredient and a product You're
trying to develop, you know, so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I I advise like, you know
someone that wants to take down 20 acres
[SPEAKER_01]: You know take the the desirable the cream
of the crop the whatever you destined to
[SPEAKER_01]: be hand trimmed as flour the 10 15% the
best of the best the rest of it should go
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately into Storage and be it fresh
frozen and then taken out as needed and
[SPEAKER_01]: separated as as active ingredients To
manufacture whatever, you know from your
[SPEAKER_01]: baked goods to your vape carts to anything
in between Wow, what an incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive rundown of both the
progression over the years as well as you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that technology I have to admit even
I haven't heard of that and it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like an all-in-one automated
process in terms of taking fresh cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and ending with highly refined and
segregated sized glands There's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: things we'll have to touch on I'll have to
give you like four or five questions But I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess the first one is do you foresee that
as the future of the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates in that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like do you think that type of machinery
will become commonplace and as a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: follow-up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be in your opinion the best use
of those glands?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your preferred method of consuming
concentrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it just stands to reason that that's
the way them the industry has to shift
[SPEAKER_01]: because already it's Flooded, you know,
the the the retail market is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: flooded So so, you know you can lower your
cost of production, but typically that's
[SPEAKER_01]: done at a compromise of quality this is a
way of Minimizing cost without
[SPEAKER_01]: compromising quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking fresh frozen cannabis the
best of the best of the best And and
[SPEAKER_01]: taking those resin glands off without
losing Turpenes to drying losing terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: to hydrocarbon extract or to the roto vape
or or ethanol or you know, so you're
[SPEAKER_01]: you're collecting all the the the best of
the best For the lowest cost of production
[SPEAKER_01]: and able to pass that on to consumers So
it just stands to reason that that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: the future There's there's facilities that
are you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple facilities and state of
California that are over 20 acres And so
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you take down 20 acres every two
weeks, you know, yeah, it's impossible to
[SPEAKER_01]: do Dry it and cure it and and all that
other stuff Especially when in a flooded
[SPEAKER_01]: market when nobody really wants to be in C
grade So, you know to take the A grade as
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers present your customers with the
best of the best of the best And all B and
[SPEAKER_01]: C grade gets turned into top quality
flowers again, you don't lose terpenes by
[SPEAKER_01]: drawing and curing You know, you don't
have to pay for those services and and the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment to do so so that that affects
your overall cost of production So in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end you're able to produce superior
products for a superior price and pass
[SPEAKER_01]: those those on to consumers without
compromising quality The second part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your question was it was just in terms of
what's your preferred method of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption in regards to say like high
quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin heads where would you just want to
do it as dry sieve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you convert it to rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's your preferred method of
consumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of old-school like with Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like my favorite is just like,
you know unadulterated high quality fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen dry seat But I do appreciate a
really nice rosin too And and I got to
[SPEAKER_01]: admit some hydrocarbons are really
fascinating too They're still they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still very flavorful and I like them very
much not too much on a distillate That's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like I'll pass on that I was gonna
say what's your thoughts on the prevalence
[SPEAKER_00]: of CRC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's gonna like fade away or
it's just gonna continue to become more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more around?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I have produces great edibles,
you know, it's it's fascinating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's it's it's a you know
distillation CRC all of it is great for
[SPEAKER_01]: producing raw ingredients for gummies and
the palethora of I also consult for and a
[SPEAKER_01]: company called Deeper they produce a
product called deeper green now You can
[SPEAKER_01]: see more about the company on my Instagram
page that talks about them if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: contact them, but I So after you actually
have all the raw ingredients the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and the terpenes and all this
stuff separated in the raws form How do
[SPEAKER_01]: you formulate them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right so that get in it got got into
bioavailability Solubility, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you take a distillate and make it
water soluble?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or how do you make it past the
brain blood barrier or you know stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things fascinate me as well So,
you know then I started teaching myself
[SPEAKER_01]: how to formulate products and I helped
formulate a product called deeper green or
[SPEAKER_01]: believe they're called essential origins
and and so the relevance being is like
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, I can take a distillate and make it
water soluble and put it into any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: drinks beverage but also also they make a
bioavailable white powder for say if you
[SPEAKER_01]: are outside company and you have a
chocolate or you have a gummy or you have
[SPEAKER_01]: all this whatever that you can buy their
product As an active ingredient no
[SPEAKER_01]: different than flour sugar or salt the
relevance being is like it's it's measured
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's it's it's If they give you Their
final product they they can give it to you
[SPEAKER_01]: in a form that if you require 10
milligrams per unit They can tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly how much of their product will
yield that 10 milligram and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces you will get so, you know if you
say, you know I do a thousand pieces at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time They'll tell you exactly how much of
their product to use to make your thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to be exactly 10 milligrams
the with no hot spots or any of that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff the also the relevance being is
it's it's got superior bioavailability be
[SPEAKER_01]: it that some of the micro emulsions will
not really process or become available to
[SPEAKER_01]: your system and because your only good
body is only capable of Processing maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: six to eight milligrams of a micro
emulsion as opposed to this Process that
[SPEAKER_01]: you will get You will metabolize the whole
10 milligrams Which when you're say in
[SPEAKER_01]: California and you can you're you're
subject to only a 10 milligram gummy you
[SPEAKER_01]: would Prefer to be able to metabolize the
whole 10 milligrams rather than six to
[SPEAKER_01]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it delivers a superior experience but
the company Provides an active ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: you can buy a 55 gallon drum a deeper
green from them and never grow pot extract
[SPEAKER_01]: pot or Formulate pot or do anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another active ingredients for
your product so I see a lot of that gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: happen especially with the Changes just
made to the farm bill combined with
[SPEAKER_01]: rescheduling, you know, what will that
allow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the larger pharmaceutical
companies to start buying active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients because again You know,
they're not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to compete with the
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna make true pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the you know Don't Involve
inhalation or combustion or any of that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stuff So I believe that it just
even starting in the research that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna want to grow Yeah, it certainly
paves an interesting Picture of the future
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can be totally uninvolved in the
production yet have it as a central
[SPEAKER_00]: feature of your product if you were saying
Edibles company for example, given your
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, extensive knowledge within
terpenes I did want to ask you because you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned you're well, I mean we've been
talking about concentrates in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: right and Dab pens for the youth are all
the craze as we know my question though is
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the heads Complained they're
unsatisfied compared to flower the dab
[SPEAKER_00]: pens don't quite hit the spot My question
is do you think that it's possible for us
[SPEAKER_00]: one day to get to a point where the Say
addition of the correct terpenes and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the right extraction process creates dab
pens that truly are You know satisfying to
[SPEAKER_00]: say people who prefer flower or do you
think it'll just always inherently be a
[SPEAKER_00]: different experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think that's a cause and effect based on
illegal Illegality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the the the comments that you're
you're referencing from the dab pens And
[SPEAKER_01]: the unsatisfied and satisfied Consumers is
that in Australia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just I know that a lot of like the
the people I talked to who are like
[SPEAKER_00]: growers themselves In general don't really
feel like the majority of the dab pens and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the the popular commercial
grade ones So like, you know, like Stizzy
[SPEAKER_00]: and those sorts of really popular brands
that the youth are very in here Don't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to quite be the same Hit the same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah another there's a like anything else
you have to look between the The the the
[SPEAKER_01]: products there there's superior products
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's both hydrocarbon and rosin pens
that are just Delicious absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious that are you know, they're not
distillates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not artificial Non-cannabis drive
terpenes and etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't they don't have glycol or
glycerin or any of that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not distillates at all,
you know, so a lot of those those
[SPEAKER_01]: unsatisfactory pens that you're talking
about or You know most of them are are
[SPEAKER_01]: distillates with with some kind of
artificial flavoring or you know something
[SPEAKER_01]: else cutting agents or Something to lower
viscosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some other, you know adulterants
in there as opposed to you know some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the I don't want to give out brand names
and stuff like that, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly there's there There's a couple
pens that I certainly like, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, or if I you know If you're not
satisfied with one don't buy that one
[SPEAKER_01]: again find one that you will or or or you
know, ask your friends what what ones they
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer and What ones they haven't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoyed no, certainly I've noticed huge
variation in the quality and I've had some
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly a test to that I Wanted to
actually loop back to something you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned a few answers ago, you know you
you've met a wide variety of How shall we
[SPEAKER_00]: say like industry movers and shakers over
the years and you mentioned that photo on
[SPEAKER_00]: your Instagram that comes from Sam the
skunk man and I'd love to ask you this
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've been around long enough to
have a perspective, but I think I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like for years Dave Watson is at times
been painted as a bit of a shady character
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of my analysis I think it
stands to reason that he's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest players in the overall modern
scene and you could make a strong argument
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's certainly up there on the
route the Mount Rushmore, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on Dave Watson?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your interactions with him being
like he's a very mysterious figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get much info on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a beautiful man and I'll say his name
is Sam the skunk man or Sadhu Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying the other words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get in trouble He is a yeah,
he's an absolute beautiful individual He
[SPEAKER_01]: is a way ahead of his time his
accomplishments are our head and shoulders
[SPEAKER_01]: above many of today you know any of the I
Agree with your assessment There's there's
[SPEAKER_01]: much to do about nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met him in person multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider him a friend He he's never done
anything malicious that I know of If any
[SPEAKER_01]: if half of those things that are said
about him were true that Rob Clark would
[SPEAKER_01]: not associate or participate with him So
he you know without getting you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of backlash going, you know,
oh he he created terms Terminator seeds he
[SPEAKER_01]: sold to GW he did this he did that he did
this he did that, you know And you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't see any malicious
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only seen good things that David has
done, you know, you know skunk number one
[SPEAKER_01]: Helping preserve and bring the haze to
light so many different things You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: most people aren't even aware of his
contributions, you know Yeah hugely I can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly attest that the more I've
learned over the years the more and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially Like the stuff that's sort of a
bit more hush hush on the back end Not not
[SPEAKER_00]: for any other reason than like,
you know, I suspect he's just not looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for more praise so to speak but yeah,
that's that's incredible to hear that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's your experience because that's
obviously You know what my interpretation
[SPEAKER_00]: has been and while we're on the topic I
guess this is a general question,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've met an amazing array of
characters throughout your life any
[SPEAKER_00]: memorable stories or standout interactions
Dozens, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know You know one time I
seen the movie blow I I'm highly allergic
[SPEAKER_01]: to alkaloids so I don't do cocaine or you
know or or recommend it or Advocate it or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that But when I seen that
money that that movie that movie really
[SPEAKER_01]: tugged on my heartstrings as it did
millions of others you know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, I I was fascinated with the
trafficking of the The material not really
[SPEAKER_01]: the material in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I started Back we're talking over 20
years ago now started conversing with
[SPEAKER_01]: George Young from the movie You know
because he was in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he likes aircraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like aircraft There's a lot of common
denominators there, you know, and as he
[SPEAKER_01]: said it could have been moon rocks You
know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was he was just moving stuff from 1.8
to point B across An imaginary line,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so meeting George Young was
fascinating to me Meeting free ray Ricky
[SPEAKER_01]: Ross was fascinating to me You know,
but also, you know the people I consider
[SPEAKER_01]: my older brothers my brethren's like Rob
Clark like like, you know George Cervantes
[SPEAKER_01]: like at Rosenthal You know the list goes
on, you know I am the ultimately the the
[SPEAKER_01]: product of all those men and stand on all
their shoulders and now have no one to
[SPEAKER_01]: thank but all of them, you know They they
all came before I did and and and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, they say never meet your heroes You
know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean true to some sense, but but and and
and and that bunch I I don't regret any
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction, you know and and and Love
each one of them in their own ways dearly
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's so awesome to hear because
you know, you do hear people often express
[SPEAKER_00]: that sentiment around, you know Don't meet
your heroes, but it's awesome to hear that
[SPEAKER_00]: that that all of those guys are Stand-up
and well, I got to admit I I saw Rob Clark
[SPEAKER_00]: on a plane for five seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked past him I said you're Rob Clark
and he said yes, I am as I was had to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: walking because everyone was exiting the
plane But yeah, he seemed like a very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: guy in that brief interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go times ten times ten He's
got a heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just he's just a beautiful person.
[SPEAKER_01]: He He is he has always been there for me
He's you know, if I ask him to write for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business times or something And
then Mojave Richmond produced superior
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful articles for that magazine and
you know, so so yeah, Rob is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: golden Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear I want to go back
because we sort of brushed over it very
[SPEAKER_00]: early on but there's so much history I'm
just gonna have to try to take us back and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll steer forward from there But you
mentioned earlier on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you you had a 60 minutes Segment that
featured you and I actually tried to look
[SPEAKER_00]: up that clip and I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, so I wanted to ask you what
Were you talking about and give us the
[SPEAKER_00]: backstory as to how you found yourself in
that position?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think some people are probably
not aware of your backstory Some people
[SPEAKER_01]: over there do you even get 60 minutes TV
show in Australia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely It's I think it's
probably bigger in Australia for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Australian audience than what it is in
America Like it was a real focal part of
[SPEAKER_01]: Australian journalism for the past 30 plus
years interesting so I was rested in 1993
[SPEAKER_01]: and One of the the expert witnesses I
hired to Deal with an aspect of my case
[SPEAKER_01]: was at Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I met at Rosenthal on 1993 under
adverse conditions So after I had dealt
[SPEAKER_01]: with that, I immediately well I harvested
within one year of my date of arrest so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I was not gonna allow them to
When so to speak, so I already had a
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and so And knew Ed and he one day
said here come to my house and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna do this interview And so I
was you know, fascinated wanted to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews were done and stuff and things
so there was no Notable note there was
[SPEAKER_01]: just producers and cameraman and stuff and
asking questions and stuff and things and
[SPEAKER_01]: so that went down Then later on we went to
San Francisco and they did the same with
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis Perot and they asked all kinds of
questions and stuff and things and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and It was a fascinating process and
that's all I wanted out of it you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then Me and Ed were dropping the the
producer guy off at the airport and he
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of turned looked at me and he was
like Well, what's what's your taking all
[SPEAKER_01]: this and I was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like we were around all day like,
you know, what are you Ed's bodyguard?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no not Ed's bodyguard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a grower and he was like really he's
like, you know, would it be okay if we
[SPEAKER_01]: came back and you know took some footage
and stuff and things and I was like It
[SPEAKER_01]: says okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care, you know, so, you know about
a week later Ed calls and he was like hey
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy wants to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I you know got him on the phone He was
like, you know who Morley Safer is and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, look, I'm not an idiot Yes,
I know who Morley Safer is and he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay We'd like to come out and interview
you and stuff and things and blah blah
[SPEAKER_01]: blah So it kind of fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I it was done up in Sonoma, California I
told him where to go where to stay etc and
[SPEAKER_01]: They came in and Morley came in he was you
know, kind of like talking to your grandpa
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was really kind and you know He
was positive and believed it should be
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized and stuff and he was you know,
pretty cool So that was kind of a neat
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction and I believe you know either
either you can Google Kenneth Morrow 60
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes interview or trichome technologies
60 minutes interview or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on YouTube actually The one of the
funnier interactions I had was I got a
[SPEAKER_01]: call from Chris Seminic from High Times
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says You want to talk to Geraldo
Rivera?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know What's that about?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, I don't know you'd have to
ask them So I was like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll entertain the conversation So I'm
standing in the coffee shop standing in
[SPEAKER_01]: line and I get this producer on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like look, you know Yeah,
we want to do this TV show and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a you know the opening segment there
they want to stand in front of this this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know big pot garden and pretty much
tell people this could be in your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood in any any neighborhood,
you know any house in your neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I was like That's not really
a positive light You know, I mean that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's not kind of the hysteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be responsible for bringing on
You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, that sounds like you're
gonna be getting people in trouble that
[SPEAKER_01]: way and he was like no no and and all
sudden like Geraldo pipes in he's like
[SPEAKER_01]: look if it's a security thing you can take
me which I thought was pretty nefarious
[SPEAKER_01]: that he was on the phone call and didn't
announce himself, you know But he was like
[SPEAKER_01]: look you can you can blindfold me You can
put me in the trunk and stuff and my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately went to like wow What a blast
that would be to to go Put Geraldo Rivera
[SPEAKER_01]: in your trunk and and drive around town
with them and you know Pull up the people
[SPEAKER_01]: and open it up and be like look I got
Geraldo Rivera on my trunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that was fascinating But you know in
the end I was not going to participate in
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that because you know that
again All it was gonna do was put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the negative light Sure thing look big ups
for not participating in it But I agree it
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been certainly a fun story to
just at least do it and know that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not gonna get in trouble so I guess
the next question I wanted to ask you was
[SPEAKER_00]: in your mind What was the first big break
you had in terms of getting community
[SPEAKER_00]: attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you was it like when you
first started to appear in magazines?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you start to appear on other
people's radar in your own mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was arrested 1993 and Then Ed started
writing articles about me because I
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately went back in a you know
cultivation so, you know You know every
[SPEAKER_01]: once a while he'd be like, hey,
could you try doing this for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, try this gibberellic acid
and see if it makes male flowers and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: do little experiments here and there and
stuff for him and You know was also a
[SPEAKER_01]: photo source for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know did that for a couple years
and then There came a time where there was
[SPEAKER_01]: a You know Let's say an opportunity just
to present My work from myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I contacted the editor at
High Times magazine and said look,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, you've Featured my
work multiple times and here it is but at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time I sent him some samples of
hash oil and a whole whole Christmas bag
[SPEAKER_01]: of treats So I knew that he had probably
received his bag of treats and was staring
[SPEAKER_01]: at his bag of treats upon my phone Call
so, you know, he was very very pleased
[SPEAKER_01]: about the treats but begged me never to do
that again which started a lifelong friend
[SPEAKER_01]: friendship and at that time he was a his
name is Chris Semenick he was a editor of
[SPEAKER_01]: height at High Times magazine that ended
up being the editor-in-chief of High Times
[SPEAKER_01]: before they Changed ownership and stuff
like that But I'm still friends with him
[SPEAKER_01]: today, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know from there, you know,
I said look I've got a new project you
[SPEAKER_01]: should come, you know, shoot some photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, he came out, you know,
it was beyond his expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So He's quickly scheduled another photo
shoot and that brought Can see or or Andre
[SPEAKER_01]: Grossman and they came out with a real
proper hustle bomb cameras with four by
[SPEAKER_01]: five Negatives and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that fascinated me right there
being able to see a Legitimate
[SPEAKER_01]: photographer do really high quality photos
and you know, those ended up being
[SPEAKER_01]: centerfolds and covers of from High Times
to a lot of the also Those ended up being
[SPEAKER_01]: covers of a red eye magazine for in
England or also submitted them to burst
[SPEAKER_01]: high in Japan or some of the Centerfolds
and magazines inclusions and cannibal in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of went all over the world,
you know but also those articles were
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty revolutionary because you know the
Cultivation setups were you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was you know, three three quarters
of a million dollar NFT systems put
[SPEAKER_01]: together, you know So, you know,
obviously these gardens weren't just about
[SPEAKER_01]: making money or profit, you know,
I mean it was their their legitimate
[SPEAKER_01]: research and development facilities for
breeding, you know, so That's that's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of what it it you know took off and ended
up being you know It wasn't for glamour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't for profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't for selling products or walking
products or you know No, no, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no disingenuous intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was about Any of the articles I
wrote any of the things I did I never got
[SPEAKER_01]: paid for I never got compensated for it It
was the purpose the purpose was to
[SPEAKER_01]: disseminate that information as fast as
possible So the industry could take it
[SPEAKER_01]: grab it and rise, you know, so that that
was always my focus Yeah, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible and so many topics I want to
touch on like first of all, you know You
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote for red eye and for people who
aren't aware This is truly like one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most like heady cannabis magazines that
was ever around often regarded as the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest magazine of all time in the sense
that it was like free from You know sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the commercial influence that you see
on a lot of cannabis Magazines these days
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was just like totally powered on
the passion and the enthusiasm of the
[SPEAKER_00]: contributors such as yourself What was it
like to be a part of that incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was it's remembered by So
many as such like an epic contribution
[SPEAKER_01]: Readers can still I see copies pop up on
eBay and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highly encourage people to buy You
know any of the magazines that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: because every one of them's jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of them's got great reads and
stuff like that like I said, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I first seen red eye magazine on
probably issue two or three and and could
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly garner that It was a one-man show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I you know back in the day,
you know, no ends no no emails or any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff I hand wrote a letter to the
editor and and you know said how can I
[SPEAKER_01]: help?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I participate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got photos I can provide,
you know I know lots of different people
[SPEAKER_01]: that would love to participate and you say
a cannabis magazine It was actually a hash
[SPEAKER_01]: lovers magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick loved hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name was Nick Cranston He produced the
magazine himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: He whatever proceeds he got from the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He bought a plane ticket He went to Nepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to Gambia to Senegal You know
Pakistan he you know went to the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountaintops He meant the gangsters that
were making the tons of hash to smuggle
[SPEAKER_01]: back to England, you know, it was just
just Fascinating the stories he he wrote a
[SPEAKER_01]: side story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he Back in the day, you know a CD Music
CD there there's when you open the package
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little dead space on the left so
to speak so When he went someplace he
[SPEAKER_01]: would take a gram and he would put the
gram in that little dead space of a CD and
[SPEAKER_01]: he would mail that to me separately From
the new magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I got the magazine, I would also
get this CD I would pull out a gram of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash and I would get to read the article
and smoke the hash and take the journey
[SPEAKER_01]: with them so it was our private little
thing and it was very very special to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Until one day he goes to Nepal and you
know when you're a hash lover you want you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to the five senses kind of sort of
the smell the flavor the the touch the you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, so inevitably you want to put some
in your mouth and kind of like between
[SPEAKER_01]: your teeth and see how sticky it is if
it's got any contaminant be it dirt or
[SPEAKER_01]: debris or whatever, you know what I mean,
so As I'm getting to the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: article I'm about to do the last five last
thing which is put it In my mouth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as I'm reading it says oh,
but when you go to this region never
[SPEAKER_01]: consume the cannabis editably because
there's a lot of tuberculosis in this
[SPEAKER_01]: region and and some of the the pressers
utilize saliva To get the the resin moist
[SPEAKER_01]: and and make it easier to get off your
hands You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know just as I'm about to bite
this I'm figuring out that I'm just about
[SPEAKER_01]: to give myself tuberculosis I didn't eat
the hash but you know Great great
[SPEAKER_01]: journeys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that probably four or five times
and it was just an incredible experience I
[SPEAKER_01]: wish every reader of the magazine got a
grandma hashed in their magazine to take
[SPEAKER_01]: the journey You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if in a purple perfect world,
but Nick was amazing Like I said each I
[SPEAKER_01]: think he he did 22 of the magazines I've
I've got issue 22, but I never read issue
[SPEAKER_01]: 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my collection Because it's very
personal to me because if I read issue 22,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll mean that that's the the last issue
that I'll ever read so Maybe even though
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick's dead if I don't read the issue,
maybe it's not the last I'll ever read
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of sort of thing So I've got I've got
the last issue I've got all the issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've never personally opened or read
number 22 But it was great because I got
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring again George Young from the movie
blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote all kinds of What people don't
understand is like, you know that movie
[SPEAKER_01]: glorified cocaine, etc, etc, etc George
was a weed smuggler, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean George George George liked we so
did so did Escobar, you know So so in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end people think that George did like 22
years for Cocaine smuggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't he did 22 years for 400 pounds
of Mexican cannabis That's what he did his
[SPEAKER_01]: largest stretch of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know the You know smuggling and
trafficking cannabis back in the day was
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what what drew me to him?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to you know get him to write for
the magazine and then the magazine paid
[SPEAKER_01]: him $800 while he was in federal prison
so, you know and and you know other people
[SPEAKER_01]: participated again, no Frank The great
photographer under a Grossman,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know many others and it was you know,
kind of a neat Again a hashlovers club,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look that sounds truly epic and
quickly while we're on the topic you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that you're involved in burst
high You know the Japanese cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really cool and quite a
niche one How did you get involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese cannabis scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, I had a worker that was
Japanese so he spoke fluent Japanese and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I could converse with him that way and
so once I learned that they existed I
[SPEAKER_01]: asked him to contact them and Provided
them like with a whole photo library.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that they were you know Probably in
a basement somewhere didn't have funding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in a highly illegal situation so
to dump a bunch of free content on them
[SPEAKER_01]: was was you know, I Felt the appropriate
thing to do which ended up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they printed them as copies of Centerfolds
and covers and stuff and we took all kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of Japanese toys and took photos with big
piles of pot It was it was a blast That's
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool Do you know how much about the
active scene is still alive today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean a lot of the world what
I've noticed a lot of the world is online
[SPEAKER_00]: like you can even find like, you know a
handful of like Afghan proper landrace
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers who are on Instagram just doing
their thing, you know But I have yet to
[SPEAKER_00]: really come across anyone in Japan or the
Asia scene obviously probably implications
[SPEAKER_00]: about the penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know is it still pretty active over
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that magazine doesn't exist and you
know, there there's some incredible glass
[SPEAKER_01]: blowers and dab rig producers that are
Japanese that you know rose rose and and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just some not fluid in and the
glass community, but I've seen their work
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're absolutely incredible
Incredible, but you know, they you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have nothing to put in their pipe
kind of sort of thing So, you know is you
[SPEAKER_01]: know besides the you know, the Thailand
situation who would have predicted that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of an interesting thing,
but Apparently now they're trying to put
[SPEAKER_01]: that genie back in the bottle and go back
to Medical and not recreational which is I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think is gonna be possible but you
know, they could do you know something
[SPEAKER_01]: draconian like in the Philippines and you
know say, you know Recreational drug use
[SPEAKER_01]: is a Crime punishable like that,
you know, I mean the Indonesia style who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows what that would what what could
happen but you know, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's a Unusual thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never would have seen Thailand do that
which I think is pretty progressive and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wish they would just leave it the way it
is it seems to be working in Fantastic
[SPEAKER_01]: passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it certainly remains to be seen
what's gonna happen over there in Thailand
[SPEAKER_01]: But I you know, I think I think the world
worldwide the genies out of the bottle,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I mean when you start talking
about rescheduling in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: Most times, you know with treaties and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the United States putting
pressure on Lebanon to stop hash
[SPEAKER_01]: production or you know, you know India or
or you know any of the other, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: hash producing countries in the 70s,
you know stomped production Based on you
[SPEAKER_01]: know pressure from the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the United States stops pressuring
those foreign countries and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see, you know slight change in Germany
legal it legalizing and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the world is gonna
progress and I think I think very quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is gonna be the least of the
world's problems Yeah, I certainly hope
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a beautiful future for sure
I want to quickly loop back before I lose
[SPEAKER_00]: my train of thought to high times for a
moment because you're famous for having
[SPEAKER_00]: been chosen as Having had the best grow
room in 25 years history of the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe the setup that won that
for you and Maybe just give us a few
[SPEAKER_00]: little pointers about how people might be
able to improve their home set up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: context of you know You are a Titan
according to high times Yeah, bless up to
[SPEAKER_01]: Danny Denko for writing that article and
giving me him and Chris Seminic for giving
[SPEAKER_01]: me that title and credit that's very kind
of them but you know, I Think there was
[SPEAKER_01]: you know many But You know In a nutshell,
like I said, it was it was never about
[SPEAKER_01]: profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about research and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know You know filling pots with
dirt to grow indoors and urban settings
[SPEAKER_01]: got to be problematic But also it got to
be it seemed like environmentally wasteful
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know the Migrate to a three inch
Rockwell cube and the NFT system seemed
[SPEAKER_01]: like a logical thing to do maybe I
wouldn't do that today because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legality I wouldn't have to Maximize every
aspect of the production, you know maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: would have them spaced a little bit
farther, etc, etc, etc, but In that we we
[SPEAKER_01]: we you know spent the company spent
Three-quarters of a million dollars to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop the NFT systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a drip from the top but also
allowed again for a hand water
[SPEAKER_01]: Augmentation but you know, it would drain
we run the waste we didn't recycle because
[SPEAKER_01]: of contamination and you know Pythium and
all kinds of disease and stuff and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know to sterilize we didn't have the
ability to sterilize reuse capture 15,000
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons of water and reuse every day back
and forth back and forth so, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but develop that system and and literally
have a bank go from a one inch clone Into
[SPEAKER_01]: a three and a half inch Rockwell cube and
finish its life in the three and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: inch Rockwell cube with a four to six inch
plan But then at the end of harvest I
[SPEAKER_01]: could take you know What was it four
hundred and something three inch Rockwell
[SPEAKER_01]: cubes?
[SPEAKER_01]: squeeze the water out and walk out of my
facility with it with a all of my medium
[SPEAKER_01]: waste medium and a garbage bag over my
shoulder, you know as opposed to getting
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of you know, 400 dirt pots and Root
balls and all this other stuff Again,
[SPEAKER_01]: just wasn't conducive to an urban
situation So, you know a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: were for necessity by not by design but by
default, you know sure and what are some
[SPEAKER_00]: general pointers you might be able to give
to people in terms of like common issues
[SPEAKER_00]: or aspects that you feel people maybe
overlook or aren't paying enough attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to that would help elevate their their
game Well moving forward and stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: today's, you know brave new world,
you know, if I only would have known Then
[SPEAKER_01]: what I know now Be it the potential for
for virus Transmission into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and the proliferation of hop laden
viroid disease I can't say enough about
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping mothers sterile and clean with UV
light to eliminate the possibility of hop
[SPEAKER_01]: laden viroids disease transmission to a
clone from one generation to another I
[SPEAKER_01]: started noticing this Over 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started noticing I was hired by a by an
individual that said that they thought
[SPEAKER_01]: they had a virus and a problem and stuff
and they would like me to prove or
[SPEAKER_01]: disprove and So there was no way to get
Anything analyzed back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it just Wasn't possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no legal labs or no legal avenue
So, you know, I put the garden together
[SPEAKER_01]: ran it, you know Very quickly it went
sideways, but it was like there was no way
[SPEAKER_01]: to confirm what it was But then once I
started consulting Once I Denver went
[SPEAKER_01]: legal I had seen symptoms and signs at
multiple locations throughout California
[SPEAKER_01]: but once I started going to other states I
started knowing similarities of cooking
[SPEAKER_01]: and curling of leaves and yellow streaks
and the plants You know stopped producing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know resin or or aroma and you know
resin content was garbage Yield was
[SPEAKER_01]: garbage, you know, but there was no you
know, you look back at you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: good quality records keeping and you know,
three four previous Generations or
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, you know Same food same
environment same everything but there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: no rhyme no reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Moving forward I think you know,
I Can't say enough about you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilizing sterile genetics meaning going
to a quality source to get your clones
[SPEAKER_01]: That will give you a report that says that
your genetics do not have half-laden by
[SPEAKER_01]: Roy disease because if it does then you're
just Spreading the the disease but but
[SPEAKER_01]: also just causing yourself problems So,
you know, but if you're utilizing mothers
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce your own clones, it's in your
best interest To keep those clone or those
[SPEAKER_01]: mothers as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you so you don't end up proliferating a
Viroid and and and so That brings me back
[SPEAKER_01]: to Sam the skunk man or Sadhu Sam,
you know He pointed out to me because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know his work at Horta farm and his
association with GW Pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_01]: afforded him the luxury of identifying
many different viruses that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible to as well as you know Rob's
work with a cannabis ethanol botany,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't I can't stress enough the
importance of some of The new generations,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know buy a book by by Rob Clark's
marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I There's still stuff in that book that I
don't understand today, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was it was his thesis in college
It is an amazing work you know as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: You know his book hashish that that book
just changed my world, you know to tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: certain it answered so many questions,
you know because you know, Rob traveled
[SPEAKER_01]: traveled the world and in the end I was
afforded the luxury of being included in
[SPEAKER_01]: his second revised edition for the article
that I Previously mentioned that I
[SPEAKER_01]: co-authored and wrote with Mel Frank about
water separation, you know, so I was Lucky
[SPEAKER_01]: to be included in Rob's book, but that
book hashish is absolutely incredible I
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it deserves to be on everybody's
show as well as his You know hemp pest and
[SPEAKER_01]: disease as well as ethanol botany like
every everything he's ever touched
[SPEAKER_01]: everything he's written this is just
beyond priceless and and that gets into
[SPEAKER_01]: the viruses and as Sam the skunk man
pointed out that there's multiple viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis is susceptible to I read a
report that the relevance being that that
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the the cannabis in California it
could be polluted with that virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a Billion dollar at least a
billion dollar catastrophe Especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: you consider that once a legal another
legal market opens up And whatever state
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States people want the
newest latest hot as trendy as cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: which typically come from existing
markets, so those genetics are gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: migrate from existing markets to the new
markets and the potential of those
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics from the Old market for the new
market of being polluted with the virus is
[SPEAKER_00]: very high it's so interesting that you
mentioned that because just last week
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a lot of scuttlebug and articles
coming out about how some plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively newly established Australia
medical scene Plants in those facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: had tested positive for a hoplite and
virus which is interesting because most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the facilities are working with seed But
there are still a few that have brought
[SPEAKER_00]: over some clones So it's certainly doing
exactly what you just said So we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: to you know, hope we're able to get on top
of this virus just to clarify But the
[SPEAKER_01]: virus is transmittable from a mother to a
seed So it doesn't matter if the clones
[SPEAKER_01]: were the source or the seed was the
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know Infected mothers produce
infected seed Yes, certainly certainly I
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanted to loop back one last time to
wrap up on the old high times because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've you've had so many You know
articles being featured about you and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask What's your thoughts on high
times these days because it was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: week or two ago The news came out sadly
that they've put out The announcement that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going into receivership indicating
that their finances are maybe not once
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were Where do you think high
times went wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to roll with progress in the in
the industry I know the old guard and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know Every print magazine is having
troubles, you know, the new generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know isn't drinking alcohol and
they're not reading magazines,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so hard to Exist in that Arena,
but also like in you know, red eye the
[SPEAKER_01]: demise of red eye was the demise of the
advertiser You know what the downturn in
[SPEAKER_01]: economies?
[SPEAKER_01]: advertisers stop paying their bills and
stop advertising and periodicals or what
[SPEAKER_01]: have you and so that's what you know,
that's how they pay their bills and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how they drive it so you know,
I Was you know privileged to You know know
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Kennedy the owner of high times as
well as again multiple staff members from
[SPEAKER_01]: the old guard and you know You know when
it sold to the new owners I believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: that What the new owners bought was a name
was a brand was a hard drive with with 200
[SPEAKER_01]: million or I mean with two million
followers or or whatever, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever their social media media presence
was, you know You know the the brand just
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't didn't didn't Progress it didn't
carry the the weight the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: merchandise wasn't you know gonna gonna
carry it through the You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just it just it reached it reached the
end, you know, and so you know sad because
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was a you know from from from
you know, 12 and 13 year old child a
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer of the magazine, let's say,
you know, I It taught me a lot and and
[SPEAKER_01]: they allowed me to participate and I from
what their archives has has shown as as on
[SPEAKER_01]: my Instagram page my contributions are as
an independent contributor to the magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: Was probably the number one contributor to
that magazine and the history of the
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine So I lament the loss but but but
you know, I it doesn't surprise me its
[SPEAKER_00]: progress, you know Yeah, look all good
things must come to an end and and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: an aspect of it certainly has to be
attributed to the changing landscape of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way people are consuming informations
and you know Instagram certainly seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the more prevalent than magazines these
days, but I wanted to talk about you as a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of surprising It hasn't come up
already, but we've got a lot of stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: it So I guess the first thing I wanted to
say was that you know There's a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that have been associated with you
but the one that comes up the most
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently has to be you know,
the purple Kush and Specifically your one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's known as the ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this cut talked about on the
forums for years I know a few breeders who
[SPEAKER_00]: use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all give us a bit of a backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does this cut come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the Genesis story on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well living in Northern, California one of
my best friends from high school who I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: still friends with today had an uncle and
an aunt that were in Redway, California
[SPEAKER_01]: and Humboldt County and so we from ninth
grade on After I started trafficking for
[SPEAKER_01]: the other With the other friend I started
trafficking with this friend And so every
[SPEAKER_01]: week we'd go up and back up and back and
bring, you know 15 to 30 pounds of outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California bud and They you know
since there was so much of it being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced outdoors It wasn't unheard of to
get common bag seeds here and there as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as you know You know, they would have
on Blacks Beach There would be fourth of
[SPEAKER_01]: July parties and you know fireworks,
etc, etc And and there was you know
[SPEAKER_01]: trading of seeds there and so I was
afforded the luxury of being part of this
[SPEAKER_01]: community As you know a fairly young man
with my friend and his family and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: would collect everything that I possibly
could and so You know inevitably I ended
[SPEAKER_01]: up getting up just a basically a purple
Afghani and a pure Afghani, but they more
[SPEAKER_01]: were You know Let's let's call them had a
had string stringy traits to them and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff They were like short squat and
beautiful so, you know and and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the the Color was fairly inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took the two I bred the two but then
after that I started Reproducing them so I
[SPEAKER_01]: could Fino hunt Fino hunt Fino hunt Fino
hunt and and in search of the the darker
[SPEAKER_01]: colors darker color the darker color You
know had no idea what anthocyanin was You
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know why I was doing what I was
doing but but besides the purple color It
[SPEAKER_01]: had this great Kool-Aid flavor and and and
you know, it was only like a 16% tea But
[SPEAKER_01]: it was you know, to me it was a beautiful
midday cultivar so, you know, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: since I'm working with high times the they
started shooting lots of photos of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: and because it was unusual they started
featuring it on their covers and
[SPEAKER_01]: centerfolds and throughout the articles
and stuff and so then it started,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know taking cold then Berkeley
patients group a dispensary and a blue sky
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shop or SR 71 Richard Lee and a
friend of my work there asked if he could
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribute it through there I kind of
wanted to see what one of my cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: would do on the open market because I
really didn't sell things or Have a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just out of curiosity, you know,
I don't I released it through both of
[SPEAKER_01]: those dispensaries And it kind of
exploded, you know so much so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it was at a time where You know
Urkel and granddaddy purple started coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out and some friends of mine were running
a club in Hayward called CC AC or CC DC
[SPEAKER_01]: They ended up getting shut down by the
feds because I was consulting for him and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff They they it's when dispensaries
were few and far between and they were one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the few in the East Bay and The year
they got arrested they ended up doing 53
[SPEAKER_01]: million in sales in 52 weeks They're one
of the first to pay state Sales tax and
[SPEAKER_01]: when the feds figured out what they were
doing They pretty much came after them and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know gave Each brother that was
running it, you know Well over 60 felonies
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know Sorry, why did they go into
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh So so, you know once they started
running their dispensary You started
[SPEAKER_01]: noticing, you know, okay purple's trendy
You know, but you know one day I was in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and and their buyer Walked into
their their buying room with a wet paper
[SPEAKER_01]: towel and I was like, what's with the wet
paper towel?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like we're starting to get people
rolling their pot and die So we've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: roll the pot and have a wet paper towel to
see if the die comes off and if so Then we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't buy the pot and I'm like,
wow That's that's how much the the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: has influenced the market and and that's
when I first Started noticing that like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: no, this is this is going to be
problematic You don't ultimately answer
[SPEAKER_01]: your question um, so so, you know a purple
Afghani and a pure Afghani You know called
[SPEAKER_01]: a purple Kush, but pretty soon it becomes
so popularized and people started
[SPEAKER_01]: bootlegging the name So I had to change
the name to ultraviolet and hence they're
[SPEAKER_01]: the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just changed that name And the
problematic part was I started seeing how
[SPEAKER_01]: trends driven the industry was going to
become and and so the one day the the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple was was was very hot and the most
desirable once the market got flooded with
[SPEAKER_01]: purple then everybody started going to
Kush the LA Kush the then then Kush was on
[SPEAKER_01]: it was Kush everything and and The more
popular it became the less popular some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those lad races and those old-school
cultivars Became and less desirable those
[SPEAKER_01]: became because they weren't marketable
because the The market wanted the Kush so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's interesting how you know,
I started noticing let's call it Species
[SPEAKER_01]: extinction driven by trend, you know,
I mean You know there there there's
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars out there You know the found on
the side of the road dead skunk that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody romanticizes about everybody
laments the loss of that that I do too it
[SPEAKER_01]: did smell like a skunk not a Skunk that
was just sprayed but a three-day old side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the road dead skunk which was you know
To me a beautiful smell, you know I loved
[SPEAKER_01]: the smell and and you know to me that
brings me back to 1983 school bus
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody rolling joints on the way to
school You know the whole damn thing
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled like a skunk that cultivar is
gone, you know and you know, I Blame
[SPEAKER_01]: trends for that, you know now it's all
candy flavors and Gelatos and da da da da
[SPEAKER_01]: da, you know So it's interesting to see
the the ebbs and flows of popular
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, but the the purple I've still
got a small amount of seeds right now
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to Raise capital to put together a
seed company Because me and my friends
[SPEAKER_01]: lament the loss of multiple cultivars that
I used to have and so we're trying to put
[SPEAKER_01]: something Together so I can restart those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just just so we could have those
flavors again, not really for
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketability or not-for-profit or
something like that, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the main focus is just because we want
that again We're kind of tired of today's
[SPEAKER_00]: Availability so to speak Yeah,
certainly look that that would be cool to
[SPEAKER_00]: see that get off the ground my My
immediate follow-up questions would be so
[SPEAKER_00]: are you saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That the your your purple Kush is in fact
the blue sky sr-71 Purple Kush and
[SPEAKER_01]: correct, but but you know again if you go
to my Instagram account You can see an
[SPEAKER_01]: sr-71 catalog that says exactly that you
know what I mean that it's from trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies So, you know, it's not a
secret that that their Ultraviolet slash
[SPEAKER_01]: purple Kush came from trichome
technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've admitted that for many many years
sure sure There's lots of stuff on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet, but it's all wild speculation
and people saying you know You know the
[SPEAKER_01]: g13 was a cultivar that was grown by the
government that you know Someone liberated
[SPEAKER_01]: and all this other stuff and it's like
that's hogwash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, you know I'm someone one
of the rare individuals you'll meet that
[SPEAKER_01]: has read something called the rips papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like rips papers What the hell
is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like so it's the research Institute
of pharmaceutical sciences papers It comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from the University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from the University of
Mississippi's cannabis cultivation program
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a public The public paid for
subsidiary or a company or college and and
[SPEAKER_01]: the data that was Comes out of University
of Mississippi and the grants and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything associated with they were
forced to put a bibliography together each
[SPEAKER_01]: and every year So if you again go to my
Instagram page, you can see both catalog
[SPEAKER_01]: from SR 71 but you can also in one of my
posts see some of these books from the
[SPEAKER_01]: research Institute of pharmaceutical
sciences And so every year that they did
[SPEAKER_01]: research they had to document their
research that they did regarding cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: each and every year So there's like 25
volumes starting in like 1982 or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This started with like, you know stapled
together hand and Assembled little
[SPEAKER_01]: leaflets to you know Actual bound books
that you know, they go through pages and
[SPEAKER_01]: pages and pages It's all the research all
the stuff they ever ever did in that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see what Muhammad al-sali and Carlton
Turner and the University of Mississippi
[SPEAKER_01]: What cultivars they actually researched
and and and worked with you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so some will say that oh This is a
university in Washington or Maine or you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, that's where the g13 came from You
know, I don't know nothing about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say that I've read the documentation
of that the cultivars that they did
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize at the University of Mississippi
and and you know towards the very very end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the program did they start even
investigating or working with any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: Wide leaf call it indica cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was mostly in leaf Sativa said
cultivars from seized product That they
[SPEAKER_01]: ever researched with so the g13 is I don't
know I find that the whole story,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the Internet's a crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Noticed on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a few photos of both the the nl5
and the g13 In magazines and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask you like how do they stand up to
today's cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was your experience with the g13?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be one that's largely been
lost mostly You look let's say that the
[SPEAKER_01]: court, you know, I got it and it was very
leggy and gangly I started breeding it and
[SPEAKER_01]: re breeding It and in breeding it and and
you know It's just an inbred line that I
[SPEAKER_01]: kept doing over and over and over until I
got something that I I found fascinating
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say fascinating I can say just
breaking up a joint It produced more resin
[SPEAKER_01]: on my fingers than anything else I had
ever ever run across So that's that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: sparked my curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was finicky It was the first to get
bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it yielded like crap You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the flavor the flavor was like just
smoking pure hat and then the stickiness
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much proved that it was a high THC
content, but there was no way of testing
[SPEAKER_01]: then I was afforded the luxury of working
with after 215 passed I was afforded
[SPEAKER_01]: luxury through general hydroponics They
had an individual that was working there
[SPEAKER_01]: that was putting together a study with
California Normal And that product was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go to drug detection laboratories
in Sacramento and they had a GCMS That
[SPEAKER_01]: they were gonna do testing on all the
cannabis and including mother's milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've still got these documents to prove
all this You know, so they I long story
[SPEAKER_01]: short 11 of my cultivars went to this drug
detection laboratory You know besides like
[SPEAKER_01]: Mel Frank and a couple others that were
able to get THC Testing done at the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Mississippi I'm probably the
second private individual that got those
[SPEAKER_01]: government entities to test their
cultivars but it was a roundabout way
[SPEAKER_01]: because it went to drug detection
laboratories and and some of the cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: tested unusually high so It was brought to
question so Muhammad al-sali who provided
[SPEAKER_01]: the standards for the GCMS was sent those
samples with the DEA License from drug
[SPEAKER_01]: detection laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my samples went from me to Sacramento
Sacramento to University of Mississippi
[SPEAKER_01]: where Muhammad al-sali tested them and
Quantified them and said that the G 13
[SPEAKER_01]: were tested at a 20 and and said yes It
was true that the G 13 tested at a 27 to
[SPEAKER_01]: percent THC and that was in 1996 And so
those in the photos you see in the
[SPEAKER_01]: magazines, it's got THC levels down below
Yeah, certainly because I mean it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so like interesting that you were one
of the first people to get actual tests
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the numbers came back so high
because the common mantra you hear is that
[SPEAKER_00]: You know stuff was like sub 20% in the
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It begs the question Do you think we've
really improved cannabis as much as we
[SPEAKER_00]: might like to think if those are truly the
values?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah because you know, you know,
let's let's go back to 1996 there was you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, there was A handful of me's,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's dozens of me's, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there there's there's an army of
me's out there creating the newest latest
[SPEAKER_01]: hottest genetics There's companies out
there the trading, you know seeds like
[SPEAKER_01]: trading cards, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's there's amazing genetics
out there that just you know every day I
[SPEAKER_01]: look at Instagram or something like that
and it blows my mind to see these resin
[SPEAKER_01]: coated cultivars that are just like
awesome just so awesome and then there's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a couple companies out
there that do high resolution Photography
[SPEAKER_01]: Shwell and Sorry, the name escapes me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just met him not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me a decal I can dig out his decal
But just amazing close-up photography's
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that that just like You
know give you a such a such an incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: close-up view of the the resin glass But
yeah, some of the some of the he was in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last one of the last published issues
a high times magazine The wellness issue
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, he's one of the people I
follow on Instagram and stuff But yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Shwell and him both do the best high high
quality High-resolution photography of
[SPEAKER_01]: resin plans that I've ever seen in my life
But yeah, so so, you know do it do I
think?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Well, you know, you've got
polyploids and stuff like that out there
[SPEAKER_01]: today And and and you know some some so
very good genetics very good breeders than
[SPEAKER_01]: polyploid on top And it's like do I
believe the 35% THC is absolutely There's
[SPEAKER_01]: an army of breeders out there producing
incredible things back and forth back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth back and forth Yeah, you read my
mind that was gonna be my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe the 35%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look that's good To hear the answer
there I want to loop back because I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized I forgot to ask you when you were
talking about the G 13 you mentioned that
[SPEAKER_00]: you did the breeding project with it and I
wanted to ask you a little bit about that
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'd read online that you said,
you know The goals were to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: height the internodal length and improve
the potency which all sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic stuff What was the initial male
you used to get that cross going and to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that line breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you look for when you select
males?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I started with the G 13 And just
inbred the the the G turn itself with with
[SPEAKER_01]: SCS So I just started got it to produce
pollen and just started, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: reproducing it reproducing it reproducing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow, that's incredible So you just did
consequential itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what what generation did you eventually
get it to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy 15 easy 15 because it was like I
said, it was just it was the first to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was finicky It was you know gangly You
know, it was uh, yeah there there it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just It was like just a sickly anemic
plant that that hated to live,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took everything I and even the final
version is like ick, you know kind of sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of except for the finished except for the
finished product Wow, I mean when when you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear common rhetoric around doing multiple
selfing projects you hear people Citing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're concerned about like loss of
vigor, but it sounds like part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: goal was to improve it Would you say that
you know when you get into like those
[SPEAKER_00]: higher numbers of the self?
[SPEAKER_00]: Generations that you you notice any
decline in the genetics or not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily?
[SPEAKER_01]: No The the main my main focus was to
produce as many seeds as I could so I
[SPEAKER_01]: could increase the variables by having as
many Options to phenol hunt as I possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: could you know that that was the key and
and again That's it wasn't by by by design
[SPEAKER_01]: all the the high numbers and the
commercialization And scaling up and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was it wasn't a want to was I
have to you know to To you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when you're breeding like that
to have as many options as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know if you can get you know a 36
inch plant to produce 200 seeds so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: in turn pop those 200 seeds to try to get
you know 900 seeds but But but but also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know find you know preferential
desirable traits within the the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: genus and and and you know look for
superior phenotypes of the genotype Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's beautiful information and I
guess something I've wondered for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: now is how much were you able to achieve
those goals like you know, you described
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain is quite lanky and Not not
compact at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much were you able to improve that
while being within The confines of just
[SPEAKER_00]: selfing it and using just purely
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We able to achieve that in your mind No,
no, you're hampered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean to do a you know as Sam the skunk
man says look You know a proper phenol
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt is 20,000 plants You know what I mean
and and and a GW pharmaceuticals or a
[SPEAKER_01]: horde of farm situation You know back in
the day horde of farm got to do some or
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in some very large greenhouse
operations, you know, and and so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's that's that's who
Educated me to that fact that like look,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're you're not gonna you're
not phenol hunting, you know I mean you
[SPEAKER_01]: are you know, but you're stifled if you
only have ten copies of the given cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: to choose from or or or you know Those are
your only representations as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I see some seed companies the you know,
and this is the benefit of legalization or
[SPEAKER_01]: or or you know, whatever you want to call
today's situations I've seen you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some you know, very reputable seed
companies, you know out there doing you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you know a hundred thousand plants
To go through and do their genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: selection, you know, I mean and that
that's really the proper way to do it You
[SPEAKER_01]: know because then you get full
expressions, you know far and far far,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know ends of the spectrum both
positive and negative, you know There's
[SPEAKER_01]: there there's some companies out there
doing incredible phenol hunts just just
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in awe when I see some of them are
just it's you know Some of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing so so much that they they can't
even you know They've got to have teams of
[SPEAKER_01]: sample of samplers and note takers because
you know, you're you're you're you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight hours of sniffing cannabis your
burnt, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you just can't do a 12-hour day
That's almost like a like a first world
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem like I got old factory fatigue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that but you're right They
certainly do produce enough that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the case and it's it's an evolving
landscape for sure I wanted to ask you've
[SPEAKER_00]: given us such an awesome rundown of the
g13 You also had a number of many other
[SPEAKER_00]: notable strains I wanted to touch on but I
guess first off the nl5 You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've certainly noticed over the years of
running this podcast is that many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: guests have like a notable nl5 cutting
they have Had or remember smoking but the
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting part is that it seems to me
like most of these cuttings They reference
[SPEAKER_00]: were different from the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your nl5?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, do you feel like it stands up
to today's stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, that's that's way to clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I did the nl6 which was you know an nl5
that I got that I ended up like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that crossing and fucking with
like six times so there hence the name and
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know it was certainly Head and
shoulders above most that I ever
[SPEAKER_01]: encountered and and you know and certainly
made a name for itself and stood on its
[SPEAKER_01]: own You know, I I found it, you know,
very pleasurable very unique very very
[SPEAKER_01]: very Uniquely aromatic was was my nl6 Wow,
yeah Because a lot of the people we've had
[SPEAKER_00]: on historically say that you know,
the nose was probably lacking to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really like the resin that and
maybe some of the potency to a lesser
[SPEAKER_00]: extent that really sold them So I guess
you you improved it and you read my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the nl6?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's you know, like as like I
said long ago the the the aromatic and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavorful qualities is like 50% You know,
I used to say, you know, it's 25% high you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you know Easily 35 flavor and 35
smell, you know what I mean is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah More so than the high I enjoy
the flavor and smell is what I guess I can
[SPEAKER_01]: say So and in my breeding that's that's
what I kind of focus on is is you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: most aromatic and flavorful But that
that's hard when you know when you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: using STS when you're using, you know pure
lines when you're using male breeders You
[SPEAKER_01]: know trying to find a preferential male
that's superior to others without testing
[SPEAKER_01]: at your at your disposal as well as you
know, I always wish that I had a Large
[SPEAKER_01]: enough facility to where I could
completely finish out all my male
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates and do lab work on those and
find superior traits in the finished
[SPEAKER_01]: product of the males And then go back with
clones that I took off those males and
[SPEAKER_01]: then use those clones as my basis of
breeding I always lament that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do that afforded that luxury Does
you know other than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We you know your thumb in your forefinger
and rub it on the stem and trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: a superior smelling Male is basically how
you chose your males back in the day if
[SPEAKER_01]: you did use males and didn't use you know
STS or something chivalric, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Certainly and you touched on an
interesting point, which is that over the
[SPEAKER_00]: past few years?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a huge increase in the number
of people demanding feminized seeds over
[SPEAKER_00]: regular sex and I think part of it is due
to what you said that So few if any people
[SPEAKER_00]: have the ability to truly run out their
males fully Do you feel like in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna see that trend continue and
will eventually just get to almost totally
[SPEAKER_00]: fam market?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Believe that would you know that would
hinder That would be a hindrance in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wood bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I believe all most of this and I've
talked to interviewed most Of the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and they would you know,
they would like something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, they will continue to produce
Feminize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they will continue to continue to
produce regulars as well as Auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but you know possibly in the
future polyploids You know, we'll see how
[SPEAKER_01]: that's embraced Or not, you know,
so so, you know Yeah, you know because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's gonna be some companies that are
out there producing not for the general
[SPEAKER_01]: public they're not producing for
consumables as flowers or even
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentrates, you know, they're gonna be
for pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna be for you know You know
commercial products of the beverages
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, I mean, you know,
I've heard that you know, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis beverages could potentially you
know eclipse Alcohol consumption and the
[SPEAKER_01]: distant future, you know as as the next
generations drink less and less So,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know those those those genetics will
produce those things so, you know anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like I don't want some polyploid blah
blah blah and it's like it's It's it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: to be consumed by you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to be consumed in a pharmaceutical
that's put in a pill or Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an interesting perspective
that I actually haven't given much thought
[SPEAKER_00]: to I'll have to I have to ponder that one
actually and you know, there is some some
[SPEAKER_00]: polyploid controversy in the community at
the moment We can leave that be for the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment I wanted to quickly ask you before
I forget you also in some of the magazines
[SPEAKER_00]: you've posted on your Instagram by the way
in case people haven't Clued in yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't gone over to Kay's
Instagram already, please do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a trade Treasure trove of
awesome old-school photos and info.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just yeah, just try come technologies
Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these two other strains keep popping
up that I wanted to ask you about the
[SPEAKER_00]: juicy fruit and the kryptonite Where'd you
get those?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've heard about him in from
other guests, but I'd love to hear from
[SPEAKER_01]: you Juicy food was fascinating You know if
you produced it today and called it that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd get sued by Wrigley's, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But but it genuinely did smell like that
and it was just again a cultivar That I
[SPEAKER_01]: stumbled across coming from Northern,
California You know and and bettered it
[SPEAKER_01]: and refined it, you know, most of the
cultivars I was getting At that time were
[SPEAKER_01]: all bred for outdoor production so it took
a lot of work to get them to size down and
[SPEAKER_01]: get a little bit more manageable for
indoor production because they were you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, they were used to be and you know
Very distant internodal lengths up to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, nine to twelve feet outdoors,
you know so that's that's what I started
[SPEAKER_01]: with and and and the best I could given my
limited resource ability and Bandwidth and
[SPEAKER_01]: space and you know You can only have so
many plants in a given rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know Yeah, I did the best I did I
could with what I had but you know Some
[SPEAKER_01]: people would say well you started with
other people's material and it's like well
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, which came first the chicken or
the egg, but I certainly believed it like
[SPEAKER_01]: the juicy fruit the D13 all the
aforementioned I definitely left them
[SPEAKER_01]: better than I received them the I first
encountered the kryptonite in 1980 1995 at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis Perron's cup and The upper Castro
that I went to with Ed Rosenthal And if
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at my Instagram again,
there's there's brochures from that cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was five cultivars entered
but a gentleman named Brian Joel J E W L
[SPEAKER_01]: is the breeder of the kryptonite.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the original Person that brought it
to that cup and won that cup and I became
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinated with it because it had a very
unique flavor you know what I and and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at my photos in my articles that
were taken at that time and compare them
[SPEAKER_01]: to what other people call creepy and This
and that whatever they mutated it into
[SPEAKER_01]: they look nothing alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't I don't know You
know, I I can only assume that the names
[SPEAKER_01]: been appropriated and and and given to
other cultivars, etc Because it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, I do have a lot of genetics
left of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So along with the purple push I hope to
reintroduce that If possible, but uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah, my friend is the one who bred
that Brian Joel That's that's awesome to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear and I was gonna ask, you know any
relation to the creepy so good to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: clarification I think I also saw two other
strains pop up maybe one called Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: another called Yoshi Yeah, yeah again
Responsible for over 200 so they're A
[SPEAKER_01]: plethora of them and and I believe in
those magazine articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were some of them that also have the
THC Levels and stuff at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of those were around 16 or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were mid levels, you know,
there are hybrids so-called sativa indica
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, yeah 200 God we'd be here all day,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I it's uh, it's interesting to see how
many of them are notable names I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask you've Won a numerous amount of awards
over the years and one of the stories that
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbed me the most was how In in one of
the first cups you entered you you won
[SPEAKER_00]: first second and third place all in the
same cup That was a pretty funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a little bit about what that
experience was like It was done by a man
[SPEAKER_01]: named Bob at the Hayward Hempery and it
was put on by a very dear friend named
[SPEAKER_01]: Debbie Goldsberry from an organization
called cannabis action network and And you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, at that point, I you know had 11
different cultivars and I was just out of
[SPEAKER_01]: curiosity, you know, I I don't really Play
in the sandbox with other kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go out and about I stayed myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep my head down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I I've you know, never been to a
Amsterdam cannabis cup back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I you know, I just Yeah, I'd rather just
stay home and work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I didn't go out much so I
was like hey just for fun you should enter
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing and I was like okay so you know
I put 11 different cultivars in and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know it was interesting I mean it
was very neanderthal it was like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: watching watching the general public grab
samples of your pot and tear it apart on
[SPEAKER_01]: on paper plates literally you know and
then they smoked it and stuff and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like okay let's see what happens here and
then you know they started to give awards
[SPEAKER_01]: and they like okay you know this this
cultivar blah blah blah third place and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like okay kind of disappointed that I
got third place but okay I had never done
[SPEAKER_01]: this before you know and so then I went
and sat down and they were like okay well
[SPEAKER_01]: second place and blah blah blah and you
know then they said buy cultivar and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like okay well that's not too bad you
know what I mean you know got a second and
[SPEAKER_01]: a third first time out you know what I
mean and then the guy that just looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: me he was like don't even sit down and I
was like what do you mean he was like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: you got first place too and I was like oh
but it was kind of uncomfortable because
[SPEAKER_01]: then there started being like grumblings
in the room you know what I mean it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like oh that's the point you know I wish I
wasn't still there so I don't know it felt
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable and you know at that point I
decided that I really don't like being a
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called you know most people don't know
what I look like you know what I mean so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can walk through most events and nobody's
points or stairs or you know says anything
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean so I enjoyed my
anonymity so to speak you know so at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point I felt kind of uncomfortable having
the general public displeased that I took
[SPEAKER_00]: for a second third so there you go yeah
that's an interesting perspective I
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly wasn't expecting to hear that
but I can I can appreciate your point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view you know certainly being a little bit
more introverted and extroverted myself I
[SPEAKER_00]: can appreciate that I guess from a more
theoretical point of view that's just one
[SPEAKER_00]: of a numerous amount of awards and just
high placings in general you've had over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years what do you think has allowed
you to be so successful in competitions
[SPEAKER_00]: what made your samples stand out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hard work you know what I mean just
attention to detail and dedication you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what I mean and again the people that
came before me you know being having the
[SPEAKER_01]: luxury of you know having good quality
genetics provided to me to breed and
[SPEAKER_01]: improve with you know what I mean so you
know I can't even really take the credit
[SPEAKER_01]: myself it was you know the generation
before me that gave me the tools to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with you know so you know I just paid
attention and fortunately I had books like
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana botany from Rob Clark and you
know I paid attention you know yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: hugely look and I think no one needs to
hear it because if you've been paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention throughout this interview you've
heard just the the numerous amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: articles you've written it it's no
surprise that you ended up writing your
[SPEAKER_00]: own book marijuana horticultural
fundamentals a comprehensive guide to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation it's highly regarded
by many in the industry I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you what was the process of writing the
book like and what are some things people
[SPEAKER_00]: can expect to get out of it if they grab
themselves a copy?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nightmare and probably one of the
hardest things I ever did trying to put
[SPEAKER_01]: all the the content you know there there
was so much more that I wanted to include
[SPEAKER_01]: but you had to limit to 400 pages so what
was the best and you know I've got I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been criticized for kind of favoring the
commercial scale even you know back then
[SPEAKER_01]: but that was my focus that was my
fascination you know but I tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: include everybody and even the small
little hand-watered gardens etc etc I
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to produce and provide something for
everybody you know keeping in mind that
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% of the photos in that book are mine
are my work I didn't source photos from
[SPEAKER_01]: other people there is 40% that's other
people that the publisher took and sourced
[SPEAKER_01]: from other people but the gardens the you
know the setups and all that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: you know 60% of it is all my work and
stuff so you know the hard part was what
[SPEAKER_01]: to include and what not to but even then
that was you know between the time that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was written to the time that was published
was five years so even when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: published there's things that now I wish
weren't in there that I would love to
[SPEAKER_01]: change some of the product recommendations
etc etc you know for instance you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the lights and you know other
products that I recommended other
[SPEAKER_01]: corporations turned around and bought
those companies and now I wish that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't recommend those companies because
they're bought by corporations you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I mean so in the revised next edition
I'll be taking that out you know so that
[SPEAKER_01]: was kind of an interesting perspective but
you know yeah the hardest part was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably you know what to include and what
not to yeah look certainly I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone's gonna hold it against you as time
goes on you know things change but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: great to hear that you're still trying to
keep it relevant with subsequent updates
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to ask you know you have
notably been one of the first if not the
[SPEAKER_00]: first to write about dry sieve extraction
in common magazine as well as large-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: water hash extraction and even some of the
first articles describing BHO I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: you've always been ahead of the curb in
that regard so I wanted to ask you what do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think's on the future what's your
prediction for the next big thing like I
[SPEAKER_01]: said taking 20 acres and turning it into a
55 gallon drum of dry sieve from fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen material within eight hours that
fascinates me you know what I mean you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you did not compromise the final
product the final product is sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: it's from a fresh frozen product the
highest terpene content available you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and and then to be able to separate those
cannabinoids from terpenes all organically
[SPEAKER_01]: for the lowest cost of production that
fascinates me as well so you know it
[SPEAKER_01]: starts with the cryo mass cryo mass
separates the the biomass from the active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients then then like I said a static
electricity separator separates and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is equipment's available so you've got one
equipment the cryo mass second equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: is the the the static separator then
you've got a board to see if a board to
[SPEAKER_01]: see will separate the material that comes
off the the static separator in multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: sizes the word to see the second board to
see will separate by size you know so so
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to do that with a fresh frozen
material that hasn't been dried hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been cured hasn't been trimmed and all the
equipment and equipment the the space and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that goes with that process to
eliminate all that stuff take a 20 acre
[SPEAKER_01]: bay from a greenhouse and on it put you
know so I say one team walks in deletes
[SPEAKER_01]: the the the plants second team behind them
takes all the the branches off the main
[SPEAKER_01]: stocks puts them in a bin does a 180
rotation puts that bin onto a conveyor
[SPEAKER_01]: belt that conveyor belt goes to a bucking
team bucking team takes all that material
[SPEAKER_01]: off the stem with the bucking puts it in
seals containers and goes into sub zero
[SPEAKER_01]: minus 20 degrees storage until needed and
whatever is is is able to be processed
[SPEAKER_01]: that day goes into something akin to a
cryo mass separator that will you know
[SPEAKER_01]: take fresh frozen biomass and and turn it
separate the green bedstead material from
[SPEAKER_01]: from the active ingredient and then you've
got again the the static separator that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available so then you'll go into that from
that you'll go into the board to see again
[SPEAKER_01]: and separate to your final size and and
those are your active ingredients I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that that will enable companies to
engage with that 20 acre facility and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like look I'm just a vacant company I'm a
rosin company and I don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to extract I want to do any of
those things don't want to hydrocarbon
[SPEAKER_01]: still want to blow up they want you know
I'm just going to take your 55 gallon drum
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in bags got a got a they got a
vacuum seal them then get a should I say
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze dry them then vacuum seal them then
press them and then you know gonna crash
[SPEAKER_01]: it out make my diamonds do whatever I'm
gonna do a CFP high terpene whatever blah
[SPEAKER_01]: blah blah and they like big carts or you
know so you know to be able to take 20
[SPEAKER_01]: acres and turn it into active ingredients
all organically for the lowest cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: production again so I can pass those
savings and and and and you know again a
[SPEAKER_01]: superior product for a superior price to
customers all organic that's that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that fascinates me that that
sounds incredible and it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a game changer the more it
rolls out and I guess I'd love to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: that up by asking what do you think is
going to be the future of terpenes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: context that we're seeing a massive rise
in the popularity of terpened infused
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis it's it's almost its own entity
I'm sure you've seen it what do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: is the future of terpenes terpenes are a
fascinating thing to me especially being
[SPEAKER_01]: someone that you know I mean was one of
the very first to enter a I separated
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids from terpenes and entered
them into a cannabis cup but they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: accept them because they didn't have a
category for him and didn't know what to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with them but there is people out there
that remember that and if you look on my
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram it shows pictures of it in the
time and place etc etc so you know I've
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely pioneered the field of terpene
isolation and application I the trend that
[SPEAKER_01]: you say of utilizing non-cannabis derived
terpenes on cannabis I'm not in favor of
[SPEAKER_01]: non-derived cannabis terpenes into vape
carts I'm also not a fan of you know I've
[SPEAKER_01]: pioneered and and and established
processes and procedures for all organic
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene isolation and and I think you know
take the cannabis separate the active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients and separate the the terpenes
all organically from from fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: material that hasn't been dried so you
haven't lost any of the the mono terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: etc put those in a bottle then separate
your cannabinoids and then after that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got the raw ingredients to mix them
back the way you want to you know and and
[SPEAKER_01]: for for vape pens or you know I believe
those separated terpenes are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: utilized for for that next generation of
pharmaceutical applications as well you
[SPEAKER_01]: know where it's just at the tip of the
iceberg of understanding the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of the entourage effect combined
with the endocannabinoid system on the
[SPEAKER_01]: human body to be able to formulate the
next generation of cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: based pharmaceuticals or wellness products
if you will yeah it's such a big field
[SPEAKER_00]: that's unfolding it's almost hard to like
articulate what products are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: exist in 10-15 years time and as you said
it's going to be incredible well we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know we're still in our infancy
because of you know draconian laws and and
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization or you know illegalization
should I say you know I explained to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know sometimes I deal with you know
pharmacologists or doctors etc and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know they'll they'll ask me about the
pharmacology of this the whole thing and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have to explain to them how how primitive
and how in the infancy we are meaning that
[SPEAKER_01]: right now if I asked you what is
responsible as some people have given
[SPEAKER_01]: credit for for cannabinoids in reducing a
tumor brain tumor so to speak you know so
[SPEAKER_01]: what is responsible for that is that THCA
or is that a decarboxylated Delta 9 and
[SPEAKER_01]: and some people would say well what's the
relevance and the relevance is is let's
[SPEAKER_01]: let's take for instance a pediatric cancer
patient I can give a pediatric cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: patient a smoothie with a thousand
milligrams of THCA with no euphoric
[SPEAKER_01]: effects so to speak you know no
uncomfortable effect where the same can't
[SPEAKER_01]: be said about the decarboxylated Delta 9
you know you can give less than a grain of
[SPEAKER_01]: rice to that pediatric cancer patient and
and they're definitely going to experience
[SPEAKER_01]: a uncomfortable euphoric effect so to
speak you know so so there's there's major
[SPEAKER_01]: relevance there you know I you know I
could give you know 10,000 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA smoothie to someone you know without
a euphoric effect I don't know if that'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be healthy otherwise but you know too much
of a good thing I don't know but but so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know until just that basic foundation
can be answered there's there's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to start from point A you know
what I mean there is no answers to any of
[SPEAKER_01]: this and today if you go to most modern
doctors and ask them about you know hey
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a lymphatic system right
they'll be yeah and it's like you got a
[SPEAKER_01]: circulatory system it's like yeah and it's
like do you know anything about the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system they'll look at you
sideways it's like but I don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about that doesn't exist
and it's like yes it does you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: medically proven and it's like you know
yeah so so you know they don't even teach
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoid system in medical
school you know it's interesting to see
[SPEAKER_01]: the new awakening of cannabis cannabis as
medicine as well as the synergy of
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics in here in you know my local
area in Northern California some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians are you know wanting to and
have in some small enclaves in Denver
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado as well you know started hinting
at legal legalizing certain psychedelics
[SPEAKER_01]: for you know medical purposes for research
and etc a friend of mine is a name Rick
[SPEAKER_01]: Doblin runs something called the
multidisciplinary association for
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic studies as well as another
friend of mine Paul Daly runs something
[SPEAKER_01]: called the Alexander research Alexander
Shogan research Institute and both of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are at the forefront of psychedelic
studies for all psychedelics from you know
[SPEAKER_01]: MDMA to ayahuasca to ketamine to this that
the other thing is you know Alexander
[SPEAKER_01]: Shogan is responsible for you know tyco
and feical two books on you know
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics that you know basically you
know was instrumental in identifying and
[SPEAKER_01]: cataloging you know hundreds and hundreds
of different psychedelic compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and amazing individual yeah
absolutely shout out to Shogan I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering his books probably 18 or 19
years old and just having my mind blown so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I was fortunate enough to meet him at
the twilight of his career so to speak
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick Doblin I had contacted Rick and told
him that I had isolated cannabis terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: not mixed with cannabinoids but pure
terpenes themselves and he was like wow
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fascinating and the only person I
know that he could really probably work
[SPEAKER_01]: with in your area would be Paul Daly from
the Alexander Shogan research Institute I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like okay so I contacted him and he
was like here come to the farm so I went
[SPEAKER_01]: there and didn't realize what I was
stepping into where I was going and how
[SPEAKER_01]: privileged that I was to be able to be
invited to go there especially when Sasha
[SPEAKER_01]: was alive and in that I've got photos that
you know of the first day that me and Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: started you know injecting the terpenes
into the GCMS and HPLC and you know Sasha
[SPEAKER_01]: was there and you know I got to talk to
him about one of the early early early
[SPEAKER_01]: early papers he did about terpenes and
cannabis and stuff and he said I wrote a
[SPEAKER_01]: book about terpenes and I said sir you've
forgotten more than I'll ever know you
[SPEAKER_01]: know so it's just it was a sweet day to
day and I'm just privileged that Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: enabled me to have that experience to know
Sasha at his end wow there you go well
[SPEAKER_00]: look earlier on when I asked you you know
any notable encounters or stories you said
[SPEAKER_00]: too many so I think you just proved it
with that answer right there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible that you got to have that
experience I've been very fortunate very
[SPEAKER_01]: fortunate to meet a lot of really really
incredible people wow okay well look let's
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it on a positive note I wanted to ask
you what strains have you been impressed
[SPEAKER_01]: by recently oh boy yeah there's there's
too many to count yeah I mean I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know them by name I again I know them by
photo on Instagram you know I just see
[SPEAKER_01]: these these cultivars that are you know
and I explain that ant could walk across
[SPEAKER_01]: it and never touched biomass it could only
touch resin glands they're just covering
[SPEAKER_01]: this product I mean and and it's hard to
keep up with every every every month
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a new one you know so you know you
know don't even know the names of them
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even take note of what the names are
you know there's just every week there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: new latest hottest product here in the
United States especially since there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: many new legal markets you know I mean
I've got friends that let's say our
[SPEAKER_01]: purveyors of the gray market and they keep
very much abreast of the trends so to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak and you know air in California and
Northern California I'm sure many other
[SPEAKER_01]: places there is something called sessions
which are black market farmers markets
[SPEAKER_01]: where your local grower can show up pay it
pay to rent a table and people can pay to
[SPEAKER_01]: come enter and then they go shopping like
a regular farmers market for the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: newest latest hottest genetics but as far
as like do I have you know any any super
[SPEAKER_01]: duper favorites and it's like no because
you know I try one then I try another then
[SPEAKER_01]: I try another then I try another so you
know between the two friends that work at
[SPEAKER_01]: the sessions my friend big up Teddy at the
Yosemite cannabis company you know I get
[SPEAKER_01]: to see you know the best and brightest and
newest and latest and hottest I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: been judging competitions lately because
it's it's kind of I don't know a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit too demanding as far as like you know
a major amount of samples in a short
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time and you know you're really
determining someone's fate kind of sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing so I felt uncomfortable in that
position but I used to judge competitions
[SPEAKER_00]: and found it kind of fascinating yeah look
that's such an interesting point which we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really talk about much and I'd heard
the sentiment articulated in the context
[SPEAKER_00]: of of wine judging but haven't heard it in
cannabis as much if at all where you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have to acknowledge the the role of
influence and power that comes with
[SPEAKER_00]: judging and for some people it can really
make or break a business depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: well they score I guess I'd be interested
in asking we've sort of alluded to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly touched on the topic throughout
the episode but what's your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_00]: the modern gene pool because there are
many people who are critical that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: we're sort of bottlenecking the the gene
pool that's sort of largely driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies gelato skittles backbone you see
that common in many strains today do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have any thoughts on this do you see it as
a negative where do you think we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go next my barometer on cultivars is is
the emerald cup because that that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: heart of northern California and it is the
premier of competition that where where
[SPEAKER_01]: the real true growers of northern
California enter and so the last cup I
[SPEAKER_01]: entered I mean last cup I attended you
know that there was literally hundreds I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I think they stopped at 300 different
cultivars of just cannabis and and better
[SPEAKER_01]: yet even more mind-blowing is the
California State Fair like everybody has a
[SPEAKER_01]: state fair right in California the state
fair not only acknowledges cannabis but
[SPEAKER_01]: now just like a pie competition and the
the California State Fair now has a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis competition that just finished
enters entries I think just this week or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that from last year's
harvest so to speak you know which which
[SPEAKER_01]: is to me is just revolutionary I never
ever ever ever someone that you know was
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested for cultivation and of cannabis
ever saw a day where cannabis would be
[SPEAKER_01]: judged and a county fair so you know
that's that's about as mainstream except
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable as you can get at this point
and you know so so I think you know
[SPEAKER_01]: competition both those competitions you
know they're they're blind blind
[SPEAKER_01]: competitions those are pretty much going
to you know drive help drive the trends of
[SPEAKER_01]: the next generation so to speak you know
what I mean will it be sweet will it be
[SPEAKER_01]: savory will it be you know your candy
flavors of gelato etc or you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: will it be you know so I find that
fascinating as well but but a lot of it as
[SPEAKER_01]: you said it's hype driven it's a you know
you know somebody out there rapping about
[SPEAKER_01]: it you know they happen to be a rapper
they happen on multiple dispensaries they
[SPEAKER_01]: happen to also be associated with the
group that produced major amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and now they're able to march
from city to city talking about how great
[SPEAKER_01]: their cultivars is and how great their
store is etc etc you know I believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: that will probably garner interest let's
say you know and and help drive their
[SPEAKER_01]: agenda and their trend and there's
multiples of that you know as well as you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you see the celebrity brands you know
what I mean you know from Willie Nelson to
[SPEAKER_01]: Snoop Dogg to Jim Baboushi to Martha
Stewart dipping into the the game you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard I heard at one point the number
one celebrity brand is Gwyneth Paltrow go
[SPEAKER_01]: figure more more more so than Wiz Khalifa
or Snoop Dogg's or Seth Rogen's house
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I think Seth Rogen's brand gets a
surprising amount of backlash because he
[SPEAKER_00]: really over prices all these stuff and it
seems to seems to not work for him but the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gwyneth Paltrow one that's interesting
that's kind of funny she's she's had a few
[SPEAKER_00]: funny products she's released I guess
while we're on the topic of like existing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the modern market do you feel that
there is a future for mom and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses in the market and do you feel
there are any legal changes that might
[SPEAKER_01]: need to occur to help ensure their ongoing
survival hmm so yeah I know I write for
[SPEAKER_01]: periodicals that would would prefer that I
don't name names and and because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: good for them or me or anybody else but
but but there have that but there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: rise of let's call it corporations that
were funded by publicly traded Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: money let's say that right there's all
there's dozens of them so there's there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no throwing stock stones at anyone a lot
of those are now one was just delisted
[SPEAKER_01]: from the stock exchange one has sold the
majority of their millions of dollars of
[SPEAKER_01]: assets and cultivation aspects assets in
favor of it's a buyer's market we'd rather
[SPEAKER_01]: just buy it than produce it ourselves so I
see I see a lot of people that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: belong in the industry seized the industry
they took over the industry and they
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed out a lot of mom and pops a lot of
people that deserve to be in this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: that built this industry and help get the
laws passed the way they are but but I I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope that with the demise of some of these
corporate entities that didn't belong in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry in the first place it will
create a vacuum that will allow those mom
[SPEAKER_01]: and pops that were pushed out to re-enter
the industry I know people that pay $400
[SPEAKER_01]: an ounce for marijuana today in California
and they're happy to do so because they go
[SPEAKER_01]: to their favorite grower who has eight
lights who does not cut corners does all
[SPEAKER_01]: the right things for all the right reasons
and works their ass off as that past
[SPEAKER_01]: generation did as those legacy growers did
for lack of a better term for the love of
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it not for the love of cash you know
and and and so you know I've got multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that would much rather go to that
small mom and pop and spend their money
[SPEAKER_01]: with them and and I I do as well and and
so you know and I do probably you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I I look forward and hope that with the
demise of some of these corporate entities
[SPEAKER_01]: that it will reinvigorate some of the mom
and pops but more importantly I hope that
[SPEAKER_01]: the investors the people that are funding
those bad actors have now come to realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that the true deserving people to invest
in is the the the legacy growers and the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who who got us where we are today
and more so than the corporates that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: don't deserve and they're then could end
up burning your cash getting delisted and
[SPEAKER_00]: going under you know as many of them are
today yeah 100% support the the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: the passionate the mom and pop businesses
those who deserve to be involved I love
[SPEAKER_00]: that sentiment I think that brings us to
our quickfire questions before we wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: things up so the first one I wanted to ask
you was what's the single most memorable
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with cannabis you've had you
know it doesn't have you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant moment to me yeah certainly I
can I can understand your reasoning for
[SPEAKER_00]: that one on the other end of the spectrum
what's a strain that was really popular
[SPEAKER_00]: all your friends were hyping it up you
were really keen to try and then when you
[SPEAKER_01]: finally did you were left a little bit
disappointed some of the bubblegums mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I mean it was just a I suspect
that most of the bubblegums I ever tried
[SPEAKER_01]: that smelled like bubblegum were
artificially enhanced so to speak with
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of you know bubblegum essence or
something like that that's probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: most disappointing because it smelled so
good it smelled like you want to eat it
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled like just like bubblegum and then
like the smoke it was like so
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointing it was a wah wah wah moment
yeah sure everyone's got their own sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stories that's interesting to hear yours
I'm gonna drop you off on a desert island
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take three strains or three packs
of seeds with you for the rest of life
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you gonna be growing three three
strains in the form of seed yeah like you
[SPEAKER_00]: can you could take three clones or you
could take three packs of seeds or any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of mix I'm gonna start with my g-13
jeez I guess I would try the down on the
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the road dead skunk as number two
I really like the old-school California
[SPEAKER_01]: orange or tangy that it morphed into or
you know they say they're not related but
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a cultivar that really smells
like a really nice fresh orange I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed that cultivar yeah that's gorgeous
to hear like you hear a lot of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: sentiment at times from the American
audience about being burnt out on say
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy or train wreck or blue dream but I
like to remind everyone that are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much everyone outside of California
they're not burnt out on those flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy I agree incredible stuff I love it
next question is if you had to start a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company with just one pack of seeds
could be your seeds could be another
[SPEAKER_00]: company's seeds what are you gonna throw
your weight behind which pack you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to the g-13 or the purple Kush one
of the other both of those have really
[SPEAKER_00]: defined my my breeding so that's beautiful
all right well look on to the final
[SPEAKER_00]: question for our interview today I've got
a time machine for you you can go back
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere anytime anyplace get seeds clone
whatever you want where are you going what
[SPEAKER_01]: are you getting 1983 approx to get that
found on the side of the road dead skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar I absolutely loved it the
roadkill the one the original one
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible a lot of people speculate it's
like an Afghani do you have any ideas um
[SPEAKER_01]: in my conversation with Sadhu Sam Sam the
skunk man who created skunk number one he
[SPEAKER_01]: told a tale how his why during breeding
there came a crossroad where his wife
[SPEAKER_01]: preferred the sweeter cultivar as opposed
to the more skunkier cultivar so he chose
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a right and go with the sweet and
forsake the more skunky cultivar and then
[SPEAKER_01]: that is how that went but then as far as
the the the consumers I believe that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it was trend driven that you know a
new a new fancy thing came to town and
[SPEAKER_01]: less and less people started growing that
original skunk and it just faded away yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: there we go I think hopefully in time
it'll reemerge and we can all enjoy it
[SPEAKER_00]: again fingers crossed and with that I
think that just about brings us to the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of it for this one did you have any
comments or shout outs you wanted to give
[SPEAKER_01]: just do you have ED it was a pleasure to
