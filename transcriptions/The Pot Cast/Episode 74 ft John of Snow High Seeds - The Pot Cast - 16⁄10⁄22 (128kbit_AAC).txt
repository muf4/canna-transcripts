[SPEAKER_00]: So on this episode, we're joined by a
highly requested guest, a breeder I've
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to chat to for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we have none other than
the genetic genius, Snow High.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to discuss all things land race,
breeding, preserving, history,
[SPEAKER_00]: future, so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty, gang, we're here for another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this episode, we are extremely
grateful to welcome the genetic genius
[SPEAKER_00]: behind Snow High Seeds, the land race
lover and breeder extraordinaire himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow High.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our most requested guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure we're going to get a lot of
fanfare for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to ask you, because you
mentioned it a bit earlier to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: how's the garden looking today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, the garden is every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, I've been in the garden lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you working on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'm working on a bunch of
Mexicans, Thais, some Hawaiians,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombians, trying to bring back some of
the old Colombian red type stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people were familiar with like
wacky weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually like the resinous versions
of the Colombian red or the Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been looking for the phenotypes
that are more specific to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to bring back some of the
favorites that people love, the Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: gold, certain varieties of Colombian gold
that are kind of more sought after than
[SPEAKER_02]: what people know as Colombian gold,
because a lot of the Colombian gold was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually either like a low lead Colombian
red that was bleached or another Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: that was like bleached in a sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of what people think is Colombian
gold was something other than what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I'm also working on some different
ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm analyzing the different varieties,
trying to narrow down where the chocolates
[SPEAKER_02]: came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a good understanding of where they
are, but I'm verifying what I already know
[SPEAKER_02]: with what I'm finding, trying to prove
from me growing the varieties of chocolate
[SPEAKER_02]: tie that were here in the States that were
sold as sticks, and then taking what was
[SPEAKER_02]: land-raised or heirloom varieties grown in
Thailand and Cambodia and Laos,
[SPEAKER_02]: and trying to figure out what the genetic
stock was that created these.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was their names that the growers were
using for these strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as it transferred to different
countries like Australia, United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, what was the strains beforehand
and when they got to the sellers that
[SPEAKER_02]: people received?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to narrow that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of highland ties, mango ties,
purple ties, juicy fruit ties,
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of different squirrel tail,
tie stick varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trying to narrow down what the
provenance of these are, where they came
[SPEAKER_02]: from, what provinces were the majority of
these varieties came from, were they
[SPEAKER_02]: lowland, highland, the microclimates
associated with them, the people,
[SPEAKER_02]: the history of those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they come from China?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they come from India?
[SPEAKER_02]: That type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm trying to bring back some of
the Hawaiian lines that people love,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the resin and the high types
that people love, and just something
[SPEAKER_02]: special that a lot of people really love
are the Hawaiian types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Mexicans, I'm trying to bring back
some of the heirloom stuff that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing still in Mexico and some of the
older stock that I'm trying to preserve so
[SPEAKER_02]: that more people can be familiar with
these lines that I grew up smoking,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is some of my favorite of all the
different types of Mexican cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_02]: special thing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the catchphrases I say on
this show is you've just given me so many
[SPEAKER_00]: avenues we need to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was truly fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the first place to start is you
mentioned the Colombian red and gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you give someone like myself,
who has never been able to have either,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, how would you compare and
contrast the two?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Colombian gold, let's start with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian gold is a really unique high
compared to other varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in its own variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high is mostly in the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clear, euphoric, it's psychedelic,
colorful, but it doesn't affect the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get an all-in-the-head type of
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tastes are honeysuckle, astringent,
kind of affects the nose, but it's light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a light, airy aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the smugglers went to Santa Marta,
the Sierra Nevada, the peninsula where all
[SPEAKER_02]: the trans shipments were happening,
the bales that they were getting,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were getting 200, 300 bales of
Colombian at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colombian gold was maybe one bale,
maybe two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to go to farm to farm and they
were only able to collect enough for maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: one to two bales at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was very rare that people actually
had the true Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was varieties that were called
Lamona or Lamota.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lamota means high on a hill and Lamona
means the blonde.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were like the Arajio Indians,
the Indians that were up in the high
[SPEAKER_02]: Sierra Nevadas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a variety of Colombian gold,
which was more of a, like a highland
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were more of the longer
flowering varieties that were gold,
[SPEAKER_02]: red, purple, turned orange and rainbow
different colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the real special stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there was also lowland Sierra Nevada,
Colombian gold, and those were the smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also very nice, but not quite as longer
flowering as the highland varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of the Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Colombian gold, the majority of
them will turn purple and gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some rare phenotypes will be red and then
rainbow colored.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the opposite side, which is the
Colombian Punto Rojos, the Colombian reds,
[SPEAKER_02]: those were more of a narcotic high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is that it has a CBD content in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually has like a body effect
unlike the Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's CBG, CBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would believe that's probably THCV as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta eight and nine THC as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of different cannabinoids,
flavonoids, and anti-science, the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that change the colors of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you will find with the Colombian Punto
Rojos, they'll turn red, blue,
[SPEAKER_02]: purple and shades.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are more dark, kind of like the
Panama red.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one time Panama red, Panama was part of
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the Punto Rojos were actually
the same as Panama red, but the varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: that were closer to the border with Panama
now were actually more of the jungly
[SPEAKER_02]: types.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hotter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dealt with more resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to deal with the more extremes of
the heat because they were more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: jungly type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people think of Panama red,
it's actually like a Colombian variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's closer to Colombian Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get these longer, different
type types that are more physical.
[SPEAKER_02]: People actually, when you had a really
good Colombian red thought that the
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian red high was more, more
favorited than the Colombian golds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the really resinous varieties of
Colombian Punto Rojo were what people
[SPEAKER_02]: called wacky weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were the very resinous dusty
types that people would sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resellers would call it wacky weed,
but it was Colombian Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a comprehensive rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've learned so much because
what's interesting is that the Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: as a broad umbrella has really come into
the zeitgeist because I think that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the advent of the black Cuban haze
becoming very popular in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: this few years, we hear a lot about the
Colombian dominance you see in that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me wondering, do you think
Colombian is one of the unsung heroes in
[SPEAKER_00]: haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people, including myself,
used to attribute a lot of the magic of
[SPEAKER_00]: haze to the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm now starting to think more and
more, was the Colombian really
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing a lot more than I maybe gave
it credit for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's more than one haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to narrow it down to,
is it the haze that first came around?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first haze was more Mexican Punto Rojo
with the Colombians that were coming
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mexican and Colombian were more the
composition of what people know as haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's old timers haze, which seems to be
all Colombian, which is not even haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just considered a haze, but it's not
what people know as haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two can be considered confused
because they look the same, but they are
[SPEAKER_02]: from Colombian genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what a lot of people believe is the
special stuff are the Colombians that are
[SPEAKER_02]: in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purple haze is from the Colombian
purple variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be from the Carinto side or
from the Colombian Punto Rojo side that
[SPEAKER_02]: you get these purple phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's the purple haze from the
Colombian Punto Rojo, I mean, Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Marta gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the combination of these different
Colombians and the purple phenotypes got
[SPEAKER_02]: what people know as purple haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, if you're looking at original haze
that was a mess with Sam when he went to
[SPEAKER_02]: Holland, they added the ties then because
what they had for haze was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: lacking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they added the different hazes and the
corolla, the Vietnamese and different
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to clarify, if someone said to
you, what do you think the original
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in haze was?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you answer with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's me and Neville used to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a friend of mine and never got to
meet him in person, but we used to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: via Skype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to say anything that
would... He was very coy.
[SPEAKER_02]: With his answers, he received the seeds in
New York from some people that were doing
[SPEAKER_02]: the shipments for... They weren't
considered... They weren't the people
[SPEAKER_02]: growing the variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these were like the resellers that got
the seeds, but the seeds that were turned
[SPEAKER_02]: into original haze and Neville's haze seem
to be more like the Molumbini madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bombshell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's hard to tell what you see from
some of the pictures and what some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed banks had received.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that stuff seems to be tie
dominant, like the original haze for
[SPEAKER_02]: Flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the earlier stuff seems to be tie
dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's original haze tie dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was it Sam's stuff that was used with
the haze that they got and they kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: went from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it original haze that was previous
to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say, but it seems the tie
stuff was more original haze later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at some of the structures
like Neville's haze, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypes look like Molumbini madness,
which they're tied derivative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would make more sense,
I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at some of the older pictures
of the haze and some of the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: were breeding it had said Mexican Punto
Rojo was one of the portions that created
[SPEAKER_02]: haze and then the Colombians that came
along with it, Santa Marta Gold,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm growing out all these varieties,
trying to derive what exactly was there,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to recreate what was the magic from
those lines, and then trying to make
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is new, but using the best
varieties that we have or able to use now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't suppose by any chance you've
talked to Bodhi about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kicked that idea around a year or two
ago to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said someone should recreate haze and
he was telling me he had a Vietnam that
[SPEAKER_00]: could work well as the tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually Bodhi coastal and I,
we've been working on this for the last
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years, working on our separate
parts of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an idea that we've been thrown
together, trying to work towards over
[SPEAKER_02]: these last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working together trying to get
that to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so stoked to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did tell me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of didn't want to throw that out
there unless you're comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're totally comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I got to chat with Kagu
and he's keen as well, but just to loop
[SPEAKER_00]: back to what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you believe then that haze,
like a two-parter here, do you believe
[SPEAKER_00]: haze has any Indian genetics in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow-up, recently we had a gas
of swami on, and he said that he suspects
[SPEAKER_00]: the tie that we see in haze these days was
the squirrel tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think of haze, haze has got to be
what was sold by Neville and what was done
[SPEAKER_02]: by previous people in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this wasn't, it's not old-timers haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what people think is haze has got to be
like original haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: But old-timers haze is considered a haze,
but it's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are two separate varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may look the same, but they're not
the same, if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tie that was in it, squirrel tail,
who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one's squirrel tail?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quite a few different squirrel
tail ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quite a few mango ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's purple ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's highland ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's purple highland ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lowland ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's golden ties, lemon ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one could it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm trying to figure that out by
growing out all these different ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Squirrel tail is kind of a broad naming of
a lot of these strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So squirrel tail is kind of to depict
these tie varieties that have the long
[SPEAKER_02]: colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colas de Zorro, they call them in Mexico,
the fox tails.
[SPEAKER_02]: The squirrel tail is kind of like the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it encompasses a lot of these different
tie stick varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be a tie stick or a squirrel
tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a total name for a lot of different
ties, but it's not just one specific tie,
[SPEAKER_02]: if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like Colombian definitely
plays a bigger part in it all than what I
[SPEAKER_00]: initially suspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that people do see ties with
a bit of rose shade glasses and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombians do deserve a bit more interest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's largely been my experience
that people seem to be more interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: ties than Colombians for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think ties are very special and
there's a lot of different ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of that is nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the 60s and 70s, people grew up
on sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of nostalgia there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from the haze portion, a lot of what
people love about the haze is the purple
[SPEAKER_02]: haze, the colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that has to do with Colombian
majority of it being Colombian,
[SPEAKER_02]: either all the way Colombian or Mexican
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on, they added Vietnamese
and some of the other lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to loop back, you mentioned your
friendship with Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a discussion point fans are
always interested to hear more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas from Suami.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that he knows Dwight and from what
he had heard, there's a few sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say unreleased Neville strains,
but just some of his work floating around
[SPEAKER_00]: that never really made it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to hear your sort of
recollection on your friendship with him
[SPEAKER_00]: and any interesting sort of discussion
points around his work you might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Neville, he was coy with a lot of
his answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want to give too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him directly where a lot of this
genetics came from that he brought over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of theorized that the guy who did,
was it Sensimilia tips out of Oregon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think his name was Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, I'd have to, anyway, Tom Flowers
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that can't be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to go back and get the name,
but I kind of theorized that some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that he was working at the magazine,
he introduced Neville to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a portion of those genetics
that he received.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other portion of those genetics came
from Jim Ortega.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ortega, Indica, the G13, and a lot of
other lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jim should get a lot of the credit for
a lot of the genetics that Neville had,
[SPEAKER_02]: because a lot of it came from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville also said that when he did
breeding, he thought that anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: was bred to F4 was pretty much true
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything past that was kind of being
redundant, which I kind of argue with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just depends on the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the points we had discussed
a lot was that he was a guy who,
[SPEAKER_00]: for some people, was someone who was hard
to get along with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people have sort of resonated
with the idea that for some people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had to be like a separation of the art
and the artist, because he burned a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: bridges and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, a lot of other people
just have sort of straightforward
[SPEAKER_00]: friendships with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you describe your friendship with
him as fairly straightforward,
[SPEAKER_00]: or was he like a complex guy that he gets
described as at times?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was definitely complex, but he was also
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he had sickness as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we would both have problems with
disease states.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a tick-borne disease, kind of like
Lyme disease here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a tick-borne variety that was
attacking his system, but it was from
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was sick with that tick-borne
disease, and it definitely led to his poor
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was difficult for him to get
around and to do things because he was
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly in pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he definitely wanted to be honest as
he could with what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the business relationships
that he got into weren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: thought out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd get into it and then realize that
some of the people flaked out on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't specify who those people were,
but anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he seemed pretty straightforward for
the most part, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: secrets there that he didn't want people
to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if people know, but Neville,
he was in Holland because his family
[SPEAKER_02]: history was from Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his family came from Holland,
but he went there for treatment for
[SPEAKER_02]: narcotics, heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's being treated by the Dutch
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after going through treatment,
the Dutch give money for rebuilding their
[SPEAKER_02]: lives, and they can take that to build a
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Neville took a loan out and created the
seed bank with that money from the
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment program, which they didn't
really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was able to create a business that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through his knowledge, his knowledge
of fish breeding, he was able to use that
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge for fish breeding and to
breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he went searching for different
varieties in Afghanistan and Hungary and
[SPEAKER_02]: different places trying to get varieties
that he used at the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually he went to the United
States and got varieties there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great synopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually heard a few different
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect yours is correct because you've
spoken to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've now heard three or four different
animals people say he was a breeder of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard birds, dogs, cats, and now
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder which one it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fish is definitely what he told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fish is kind of a strange thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fish multiply and you kind of get the
filarial generations, the F1s,
[SPEAKER_02]: F2s out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense that he used that for
his breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of used that type of breeding
into what he used for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you touched on the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask you, there's a growing
sentiment among the real heads and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders that I know of that is
essentially along the lines of Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: stock or stock from the seed bank is some
of the most consistent slash killer stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll ever get.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your experience with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think it probably is some of
the best gear that was ever available,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I don't necessarily think it's
the best ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it came from the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it came from private breeders and
growers that were doing their own breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were brought over and then
exposed to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the earlier stock he was able to
get in Afghanistan was good at first,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then it was watered down through Dutch
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of homogenation and early flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people think that a lot of
Afghani, for instance, are all broadleaf
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're all fast and indica looking
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't realize that the best varieties
of Afghani were actually narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were like the hash for hash,
but they were longer flowering heirloom
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because in the mid seventies,
there was so much want for Afghani hashish
[SPEAKER_02]: that they couldn't keep up with
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back in the past, they'd keep big
wheels of hashish with the family
[SPEAKER_02]: heirlooms and crests imprinted on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all those old hashish slabs were sold
and then they had nothing left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they did was incorporate the
heirloom varieties with the varieties that
[SPEAKER_02]: were along the sides of the roads.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more the tribal types of hash,
the stuff that was faster flowering,
[SPEAKER_02]: not quite as good, but produced a lot of
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they incorporated the two and then it
watered down the Afghani genomes,
[SPEAKER_02]: the varieties that were people got exposed
to after like 76, 77, that started going
[SPEAKER_02]: downhill.
[SPEAKER_02]: The king got ousted in, I think,
76, 77, King Zaire Shah, but he had maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, 40 years of peace, maybe even longer
in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened was prior to the
paraquat spring in 1979 in Mexico and in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica, the CIA had sprayed paraquat on
the poppies and the hash producing plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as the food crops in Afghanistan,
basically brooning their food supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically starving out the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once they had permission to do that,
they left the CIA and the people had
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing else to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were starving, their food supplies
got ruined by paraquat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were sickened by the paraquat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they went back to what sold and
grew the fastest, which was cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: poppies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a way we kind of caused the
terrorism and all the stuff that happened
[SPEAKER_02]: later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then right after that had happened,
there was people starving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It caused the people to revolt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The king was ousted.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cousin went into being power and then
the Soviets invaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we know what happened from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the Taliban is going back into
Afghanistan now and taking control.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the varieties that were freed up
after the United States went in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started coming available are now going to
be disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same as what happened after the Soviets
invaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those varieties that people were able to
get and had for many decades and years had
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get these nice, great Afghani
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, they weren't able to get
these nice heirloom Afghani lines because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the invasion of the Soviets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back to the seed bank, I think that
all over the world, there's lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders that have been growing these
lines, a lot of land races, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: developed their own acclimatized stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the unsung heroes, the
smugglers, the growers, the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: went harm's way to gather these varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the people that should be
recognized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that is not known.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these heads went through
dangerous times of camp helicopters in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, which is California against
marijuana production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very harsh and stringent laws against
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's a lot of unknown people
that should get credit for the stuff they
[SPEAKER_02]: did to create some of these varieties and
to sustain them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard that sentiment before that
Neville certainly was standing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of giants in what he released
and made commercially available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to know, have you been
tracking at all the Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductions that have been done by Todd
McCormick and CSI slash Matt Riot?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Northern Lights, Greg,
who seems to be the legit source of
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I haven't been online,
so I don't know what other people are
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard stuff, but I don't know what
they're claiming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have really nothing to say about it
because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember getting Northern Lights in the
90s when it wasn't a seed line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I remember from the Northern
Lights that we got, it was a very highly
[SPEAKER_02]: resinous, almost blue-white crystalline
herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very narcotic, but also made you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very stony stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unlike the stuff that was produced by
the Dutch later on that was sold as
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Northern Lights variety by
Classic, and his story is that he met up
[SPEAKER_02]: with Indian Jim up in Washington on a
fishing trip, and he was able to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Northern Lights from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've grown that Northern Lights,
and that one's very strong and high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So other than that, and the Northern
Lights I smoked back in the early 90s,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Dutch Northern Lights is something
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other people are growing,
I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not following anybody else,
so can't really say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to quickly ask you,
what's your thoughts on NL5 Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there has been a notable
resurgence among consumers and growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess more broadly, it often does
get given the title of sort of the poster
[SPEAKER_00]: child of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a special one for you, or just a
more well-known one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a more well-known one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a higher-yielding, hazy-ish Indica
Civa multi-polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it gets a lot more publicity than
it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, I mean, following on from
that, I had a number of questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more importantly, the fans had a lot
of questions about Neville's Hayes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess it speaks to the fact that it
is so rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even now, you really don't see it going
around much, and people are aware that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were, and myself, very keen to
hear, would you be able to give us a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a rundown on what your Neville's Hayes
cut is like, and do you plan to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: it going forward at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not a cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a seed line, and the seed line was
originally from Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bred to F3 before I bred it to
other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phenotype that I chose was a
large-yielding candelabra style,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it had some of that northern light
structure, but basically, the larger plant
[SPEAKER_02]: structure, like the Colombian plants,
so it had some bulk, but it also contained
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the haziness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was more like a Mexican,
creating these long, thick bread loaf-like
[SPEAKER_02]: colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell was incense-y, like an Indian
nang champa, but more rich and sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very luxurious and unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I'd bring that, when I was
supplying herb to the different medical
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs in the early 2000s, when I went to
the different clubs, I'd give samples to
[SPEAKER_02]: the different bud tenders, and the female
bud tenders especially loved that stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they always wanted more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that good, but the Hayes was almost
near perfect, that Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get almost as high as you possibly
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taste, the smell, the aroma,
it's all very, very good, and I crossed it
[SPEAKER_02]: to purple tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets the purple traits, the colors,
the trichomes turn purple, the resin
[SPEAKER_02]: glands, the trichomes got some colors to
them, and that adds a different type of
[SPEAKER_02]: flavonoid and turpent profile than the
regular Neville's Hayes by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it a little bit more complex,
but it's a great and wonderful plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other Neville's Hayes that I've grown
those ones seem to be more sparse,
[SPEAKER_02]: very nice, but more hazy-ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that I used is more of a larger
yielding, but also retains all the best
[SPEAKER_02]: qualities that you'd want.
[SPEAKER_02]: A large yielding Hayes, it's like what you
want as far as yields and buds and the
[SPEAKER_02]: density in a modern variety, but with all
the qualities of the longest flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: Hayes, almost, if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you brought it up, I guess I'll
quickly touch on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also noted that you had the Oregon
purple tie, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't have Oregon purple tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a chocolate tie that I believe was
the source of what created the Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: purple tie, which is a Highland Oaxacan
gold and the chocolate tie to create the
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon purple tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except the chocolate tie doesn't have any
of the mutations and weird stuff that's
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with Oregon purple tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the colors, it's got the highs,
everything that you like about flow,
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe a majority of that comes from
that chocolate tie, which I believe is a
[SPEAKER_02]: purple tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't gotten there to verify it,
so I believe that is the root stock of
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon purple tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bred that into some varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've released a little bit of it so far,
but I lost the mother, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: during my aunt's funeral this last
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little bit of the seed stock
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to revive, but what I've
bred into it is still a little bit
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be some magic still,
and then I'm working with other chocolate
[SPEAKER_02]: ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a special line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess as a follow-up, I noticed you've
got the blueberry blast, which is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the blueberry and the Neville's
haze in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I was wondering, how would you
describe that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it turn out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it could be a better
version of Blue Dream to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a follow-up, what's your thoughts on
the blueberry family in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you fond of it, or it's just one of
the things for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, where to start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start on the blueberry blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made the blueberry blast when I was
supplying the medical clubs in Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were growing in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our family farm is in the Emerald Triangle
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to see what was selling in the
medical clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is before it got famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to where I was growing and found
the different cuts that were going.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was two different cuts of Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I grew those commercially that same
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is before most people knew about Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred two versions of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Called Pipe Dream and Blueberry Blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The narrow leaf, more hazy version Blue
Dream was bred into the Pipe Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male for that was the Acapulco Cold
C99 male.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Blueberry Blast had the Johnny Blaze,
which is Neville's haze and blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was slightly larger yielding,
that Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves were a little bit more broader,
not by much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Resin production was a little bit more on
the narrow leaf one for the Pipe Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were both awesome and very close in
effects and yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality of the Pipe Dream was slightly
better in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it more than the one I used for
the Blueberry Blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Blueberry Blast was my version of a
commercial variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best Blue Dream at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically trying to make it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quite a few phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them are larger yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are more hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can have a seven week Blueberry
Blast for some of the faster phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can have one that goes to 14 to
16 weeks for some of the longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of them are super resonance,
have that blueberry, cedar, wood aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very luscious and tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect is kind of like strawberry
cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that original haze type high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get really high for a few hours and
then it will allow you to eat munchies or
[SPEAKER_02]: eat if you like and sleep if you want in a
nice dreamful restful state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like a all-encompassing
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of lets you go up and then takes
you down if you need to do what you need
[SPEAKER_02]: to do and be restful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some haze and sensitivities kind
of will keep you amped for a while and it
[SPEAKER_02]: can be tiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can kind of wear you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that kind of allows you to do what you
need to do when you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your thoughts on the sort of
work by DJ in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll preface this that I noticed
you do the Grape Crush F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be keen to hear your thoughts on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you're fond of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Grape Crush is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful line, very strong, has some
mutants as a lot of the DJ stuff does,
[SPEAKER_02]: but keeps it interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very strong, potent, smaller,
yielding indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeds well with other lions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made some very powerful varieties
breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some phenotypes are better than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the blueberry lions, a lot of the
stuff is... It was better at one point
[SPEAKER_02]: than it is now, it seems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the genetics were more pure at
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of... Something's
changed over the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think DJ has said it was the Afghanis
who kind of added more into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of seems more evident with
like the flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flow seemed to be more Mexican,
[SPEAKER_02]: more Mexican in yield and percentages than
it is nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you get more of a Afghani centric type
of variety with a lot of these flow and
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry types.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blueberries that I had back in 97 was
super tasty, flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff now is also very flavorful,
but the phenotypes are kind of all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the place, but awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're looking for specific
plants to grow, they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding can be a little odd because of
the multipoly hybrid aspects of the lions
[SPEAKER_02]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, while we're sort of talking about
strains of yesteryear, I'd love to quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: ask you, were there any notable ones that
we hear a lot on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the SSSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they ever put out any notable things
for you or were there any other brands
[SPEAKER_00]: from around that time that really stick
out in your mind as quite memorable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, SSSC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got to know one of the people that
did the shipping for SSSC and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that he was growing, SSSC
SuperCitiva Seed Club had incorporated in
[SPEAKER_02]: their lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's known as Williams Wonder was
actually my friend's strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to say where he's from,
but he's from the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his name was also my name,
but the other name for John is William.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Williams Wonder was one of his strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hawaiians were also associated with my
friend and some of the other varieties as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, Hooser, Hooten, Holler.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just like him, he was able to
incorporate to what a lot of people loved
[SPEAKER_02]: about SSSC, just like Neville got stuff
from other people and shared that with the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he should be noted as being something
that people got something really that they
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyed from this individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the varieties from SSSC were the
same as the seed banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basic Five was the Neville's, sorry,
the Northern Lights number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Basic Five Skunk was like Skunk,
Northern Lights, Crosses, or like Shiva
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the stuff was just renamed
with some of the same cuttings that were
[SPEAKER_02]: available to the seed bank and SSSC in
Holland at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people had known as the Pinetown
Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinetown is actually a town or a little
district in Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a piney Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just from that part of Durban in
South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, the South African
crosses, South African is the Durban in
[SPEAKER_02]: those crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say that, but it says South
African, but South African is actually the
[SPEAKER_02]: Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say on the description,
but if you see South African, it's Durban
[SPEAKER_02]: and then whatever the cross is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people speculate that the
common Durban cuttings floating around the
[SPEAKER_00]: USA at the moment, the notable ones,
have maybe some Afghan crossed into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know a lot of the Dutch ones
definitely seem like they have skunk to
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that are in the United States,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Durban that was associated with
one of the guys that did some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis books.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the other gentleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: The name is escaping me at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an older gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mel actually went to Durban and brought
back some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of what people got, one of the
stock that was released as like Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think some of the seed banks in
Holland got was his Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what a lot of some of the growers were
growing in Mendocino was different
[SPEAKER_02]: versions of his Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of what people see are these
little stocky Durban poisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like from his stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Durban poison is actually a hybrid of
some of the Bantu tribe that came from
[SPEAKER_02]: northern Africa down to South Africa,
Swaziland and the Zulu nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Eastern Cape tribes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those varieties got mixed in with what was
later came in from the indentured Indian
[SPEAKER_02]: servants in the 1800s from mostly South
India from like Kerala, Orissa,
[SPEAKER_02]: Andhra Pradesh, and then a small
percentage from Himal Pradesh in the
[SPEAKER_02]: northern Indian area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But majority of the Indians that were
indentured servants, basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, slaves, but were moved from
South India to work the sugar plantations
[SPEAKER_02]: after they freed the black slaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: This also happened in the West Indies and
like Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: The indentured servants came to work the
sugar plantations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you get some of the
Jamaican varieties, which were Indian and
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican, and then later on were Indian
Columbian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Durban poison is a combination of
African and South Indian.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why some of them were more compact
and bushy and then other ones were more
[SPEAKER_02]: taller like a Malawi or some Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's definitely some variations
with the Durban poisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just one variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I think a lot of people
misunderstand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just it's an heirloom land race
now, but it's acclimatized over a period
[SPEAKER_02]: of time due to two peoples coming
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lesoto is a version of the same thing
going on where it's like Bantu tribes
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed with North India because some of the
Lesoto varieties are very stony and
[SPEAKER_02]: physical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes more sense that that
hybridization is a combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you just mentioned,
you know, the Indian genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think they're so sort of
underrepresented?
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to a lot of other land races,
do you think they've got something to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer that a lot of people might be
overlooking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of varieties in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were growing cannabis for many,
many years for the people, for food
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes, for medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, there's definitely a lot of
stuff underrepresented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why it's not getting the notorious like,
you know, the highlights like other
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's been watered down by mixing up
so many varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of the Indian varieties,
you know, they create a lot of hashish
[SPEAKER_02]: from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to see the different
varieties from one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of the Colombians are more,
you know, colorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as standing out as a Sistiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe people will see the Colombians
standing out more so like with a haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Indians, I think, don't get the credit
they need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's such a wide area of growth in
geographical people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so many different people,
such a long history.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the what it was called Soma,
which was the sacred cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the Persians had Haoma,
the Zoroastrian religion pre-Afghan area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, what was once an area of
long cannabis history has been separated
[SPEAKER_02]: by religion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of what was India previous to
like the 1950s was, you know, where
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistan is now at Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that, what is India was all of that
previous to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, a mix of different
peoples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's a lot of stuff that
should be revived and a lot of that
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge, you know, should be explored
more, a lot of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's some good people from
the Indian Land Race Exchange are raising
[SPEAKER_02]: some other people that are trying to put
some more focus on these varieties than
[SPEAKER_02]: these farmers that should be supported.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of these people are
starving, you know, they're not getting
[SPEAKER_02]: much for their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not getting much to live on in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a lot of governments should
support these people, these histories of
[SPEAKER_02]: these cannabis varieties, because it's not
only, you know, a history of these people,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis is kind of like a
sociological social history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that they can grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also a history of those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's knowledge that passed down from,
you know, father to son to mother to
[SPEAKER_02]: daughter and should be treasured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much history there that we
just haven't been able to let the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: the world know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, with time, we can kind of
show people more of what's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most certainly definitely need to have
more attention placed on the indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and supporting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you sort of touched on the farmers
and a conversation I've been having more
[SPEAKER_00]: so with friends in private sort of goes
along the lines of, is what we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: with modern cannabis breeding really that
good compared to what the indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers were doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it seems as if we're losing a lot
of the special stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people complain about how
there's this sort of sane everything has
[SPEAKER_00]: this same quality, you know, everything in
the dispensary sort of feels about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously a deep philosophical rabbit
hole to jump down, but I'd love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: your take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think it's that difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of what people are growing
and are exposed to are what was created
[SPEAKER_02]: from the seed banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of seed banks were northern
lights, skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that was incorporated into almost
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything's that same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk, Afghani, northern lights type high,
but only from certain varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Afghani varieties that the Dutch were
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to pick on the Dutch, but this is
what was happening to grow varieties that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be more conducive to indoor
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: They selected plants that would finish
fast, would be more homogenous,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning they would flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the whole plant would flower at
one time instead of flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you pick plants that are early
flowering and, you know, and homogenous,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're actually selecting the qualities
that aren't as potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could if you get lucky,
but when you pick out varieties that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't disease resistant, aren't for
potency, aren't for quality, you're losing
[SPEAKER_02]: the best parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're watering them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, they were watering down
the genetics to fit a need because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal state of cannabis that's been
happening since the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis was illegal,
so they had to go indoors for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were breeding varieties that
would go grow indoors easily for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Dutch were doing this as a
convenience, which made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, they watered down a lot
of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that happened was the
genetic stocks that they had were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as they were trying to keep
germination, fresh seed available to the
[SPEAKER_02]: customers, they were killing off or
destroying their old seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem was as they were watering down
their varieties for fast maturing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, homogenous plants, they couldn't
go back to their old seed stock because
[SPEAKER_02]: they destroyed it because they were trying
to keep up and keep fresh seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only thing that they had were these
old clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the seed stock wasn't something they
could go back to unless they had,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, long term storage or something
they could.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they destroyed a lot of genetic
germplasm, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, they're
searching around the world for new
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties or old varieties that farmers
were growing in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: around the world, Australia or different
countries now because of what happened to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, they're
searching around the world for new
varieties that farmers were growing in the
United States, around the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia or different countries now
because of what happened with the poor
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So breeding for potency and quality is
what I do foremost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else you can narrow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick for faster flowering plants
out of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've acquired something that's
strong and has the qualities you want,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, colors, taste, aroma,
all that stuff can be fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you got a weak plant that doesn't
have the qualities that make it unique,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's not special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the majority of what people are growing
out there are fast growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: great for production, you know,
great for a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people that are smoking it are
getting the end result of what is good for
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmer, but not good for the smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people, if they want these higher
quality strains, should ask, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding practices to evolve where some of
the better higher quality plants are made
[SPEAKER_02]: to yield more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also request getting paying the
farmers more for something that may take
[SPEAKER_02]: longer to grow, but has a higher quality
that these smokers would like to enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's so much more out there
that's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're just not being able or being
exposed to it because the lack of
[SPEAKER_02]: availability and the lack of commercial
growers growing these varieties because
[SPEAKER_02]: they just don't yield as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a plant that yields five
pounds and another plant that yields a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple ounces, you're going to grow the
plant that grows five pounds because even
[SPEAKER_02]: if you sell it super cheap, you're still
getting a lot more money for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farmers just thinking, you know,
apples and oranges, they're growing these
[SPEAKER_02]: things because they're trying to sell,
you know, they're trying to make money,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it doesn't make any sense for a farmer
to grow something that barely yields
[SPEAKER_02]: anything if they're not going to get much
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's unfortunate reason why people
aren't getting exposed to these varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's just not worth the farmer's
time because the smokers aren't paying for
[SPEAKER_02]: that extra time spent to grow these
varieties, which take longer and don't
[SPEAKER_02]: yield as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, some of these strains,
you can get the higher yielding plants
[SPEAKER_02]: with the higher qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I try to incorporate with some of my
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes you just need to spend extra
time to grow them because people are
[SPEAKER_02]: missing out on the best quality highs and
experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you grew up on cushions and
indicas, you may have not ever gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just been stoned and people just
don't understand that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't understand that you can get
happy and giggly and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: laugh yourself into fits and, you know,
laugh so hard that your stomach hurts and
[SPEAKER_02]: you start spitting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a great, wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many different highs that
give you happiness and euphoria and
[SPEAKER_02]: colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of magic out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just most people haven't been able to
experience that, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned it yourself just then that
you've tried to breed some strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: have that high quality and the increased
yield to accompany it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the listeners out there whose ears
have perked up, do you want to throw some
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What of your strains fit that bill for
anyone who's keen to try?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of them would be the Dragon's
Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly Thai Hawaiian, but it's got
the longer flying Thai highs, but with
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a Hawaiian modern resin profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get the larger yields and resin
from like a modern variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get the yields and looks that
everybody wants and smells and tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it smells tasty, wonderful,
like pineapple, tropical fruits,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you get these wonderful soaring highs,
euphoric energy that just makes you happy,
[SPEAKER_02]: unlike many other varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'd be one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are so many that I could
mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberry Blast was a good one,
though I have to remake the variety
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was another connoisseur
commercial variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It yielded very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great for growers and it was great
for smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of all-encompassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many varieties like that,
but there's also for like the true
[SPEAKER_02]: connoisseur, you get these modern resin
profiles, but with the longer flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: Thais associated with Thais, Colombians,
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that sounds really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a few questions back, you
referenced the Acapulco Gold C99 male,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I noticed you used that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those crosses also fit the bill in a
sense because they seem like fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: uplifting, sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the yield as well,
or are they more for a different sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, a lot of those were for
commercial purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get a higher quality, commercial,
viable, but with the highs that people
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, the C99 Acapulco Gold varieties
were more of a trying to get people to try
[SPEAKER_02]: out some of these lines, but with a
semi-moderate flowering period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fast enough for many people,
but takes a little bit longer than some,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you get high quality, unlike a lot of
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't get the same generic high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a great sort of middle
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've touched on it a bit, and I'd love
to delve deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of discussion currently
around what is it that actually causes us
[SPEAKER_00]: to perceive something as an indica versus
a sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard people more recently say,
oh, it's all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remembered having a discussion with
Bodhi, I believe it was, and he said to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I've got this Afghani that smells like
this Thai I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they both test at like, you know,
about the same, like let's say they both
[SPEAKER_00]: test at 20% and they both smell the same,
but one's clearly indica and one's clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me thinking like, yeah,
like what really is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not so sold it's terpenes,
but I'd love to hear more and be educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of people they call multi poly
hybrids sativas when they have an up high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they call indicas that narcotics stony
high, you know, stony effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth is that the nomenclature,
the names for all this stuff is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: A sativa would typically be like a
tropical or equatorial variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't have to be because there's
microclimates everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in Afghanistan, there's also
sativas, there's narrowly varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the up highs, but you can also
have a sativa that has a narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it depends, are people
calling the sativa because it's got narrow
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves in a, you know, a upright,
you know, smaller flower set with an up
[SPEAKER_02]: high sativa, but if it has a narcotic
effect, is that an indica or is it a
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a sativa, but it's got a
narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the chemotypes associated with a lot of
these varieties, basically a lot of this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff should be renamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: An indica should be anything that should
be from India, you know, indica,
[SPEAKER_02]: indica, India, but there should be hash
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be equatorials.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be tropicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be jungle, varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be highland.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be lowland, more of the
environment that's associated with and the
[SPEAKER_02]: type of plant it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a hash plant or is it a ganja plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something that you smoke for flowers
or is it something that you harvest for
[SPEAKER_02]: hash or is it a hash like plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: So indica sativa, you know, it's kind of
too broad and people use it for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at least the OG cushions sativa
because it's got up high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously it's, an indica,
but, you know, just because it has up high
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't mean it's a sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clear as mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think as the, you know,
the extension of that, what do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: is the mechanism through which it's
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you think there's maybe some
yet to be characterized molecules and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, if they're there, they give you that
more uplifting effect or how do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: it plays out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it seems like a lot of the current
speculation is sort of yet to be proven,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot of unknowns in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly of what people have been studying
is the cannabinoids and the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: the primary terpenes, but there's also
long chain terpenes profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's these things that insects ward
off against because the plant is giving
[SPEAKER_02]: off a terpenes profile that is like a
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also it, you know, acts as like a hormone
for humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the plant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's these unknown terpenes profiles
that we have yet to record all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't even know all that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to identify them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need to identify what their
properties are because they work with the
[SPEAKER_02]: primary terpenes to have the tertiary
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they add, they go with the
cannabinoids and the primary terpenes to
[SPEAKER_02]: add to the overall effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also these flavor of cannabinoids
that, you know, cause colors and these
[SPEAKER_02]: cause effects and the effects on a nerve
can result in that nerve firing for a
[SPEAKER_02]: longer period of time or shorter period of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of a sine wave, you know,
those things you see on like an EKG that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, goes straight and then it goes
up and then goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, let's just say a nerve firing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have THC for one, it fires off at a
certain height.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you add another cannabinoid like CBG
and that height actually goes even higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you put CBD in that, in that same
two molecules might go lower, but it might
[SPEAKER_02]: extend the duration of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it lasts longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have the same effect, but longer,
or you have the same effect but not as
[SPEAKER_02]: high, but longer or shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these things that add to these
cannabinoids, these different components
[SPEAKER_02]: either can make the high more potent or
less potent or make it longer duration or
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter duration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could also cause effects that give you
like a soaring effect or a heightened
[SPEAKER_02]: color effect or, you know, sensation that
is more associated with the hearing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, affects your hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cannabinoids affect the nerves by
either directly attaching themselves and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, making it more potent,
stronger duration, lower duration,
[SPEAKER_02]: higher duration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these different effects that need
to be cataloged and what the uses in they
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as the effects of like
inicustativa, a lot of the basic
[SPEAKER_02]: information is you can have a Colombian
gold or you have like Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: These don't have a CBD in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have THC, sometimes THCV if they're
from like Thailand or South Africa,
[SPEAKER_02]: some from Colombia, or they have CBG,
CBC, but there's no CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they have there is a super small
amount, though you can have something like
[SPEAKER_02]: a Pama Red or Colombian Punto Rojo that
has CBD, but is also considered like a
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get these narcotic effects mixed
with the high sativa effects, but in a
[SPEAKER_02]: different way than a say a hash plant that
has more of a narcotic effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: so more CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: So high CBD and high CBN tend to give you
the narcotic effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lacking CBD with these other cannabinoids
give you what people, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: feel as a sativa effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to go re-listen to that
myself, and I'm sure the listeners will as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of a sort of slightly adjacent
topic, I've spoken to DJ Short and many
[SPEAKER_00]: others about this, but I'd be interested
to hear your take on what causes modern
[SPEAKER_00]: strains to have a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can only get so high and if
you keep smoking, you sort of don't go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere else, but with a lot of the land
races, particularly the sativas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can sort of just keep going and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think causes that ceiling?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the ceiling is CBD typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CBD can be used if, say, you're
freaking out or your friend's freaking
[SPEAKER_02]: out, or you've taken edibles and you're
just too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking doses of CBD will modulate the high
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the comfortableness that you get
from too much THC can be brought down with
[SPEAKER_02]: higher amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll bind to the THC and kind of get
you out of that, you know, at least bring
[SPEAKER_02]: you down to a more comfortable state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So higher amounts of CBD will kind of help
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the ceiling this high that seem to
take you higher and higher, those strains
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to have no CBD or very little CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's also, you know, cannabinoids
that are in higher amounts like CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG varieties with THC seem to potentiate,
make the THC more potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, higher amounts of CBG with
the THC along with THCV, you get even more
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions like Malawi varieties have the
THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get more of this rushing waves of
euphoria and seems like there's no ceiling
[SPEAKER_02]: as you smoke more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you smoke a little bit and you
can't physically smoke too much because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just so high because you keep going
higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you had CBD in that, you could kind
of counteract the comfortableness of the
[SPEAKER_02]: high THC in your body and it'll bring you
down, if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm wondering then,
do you think that we like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these modern strains have some
amount of CBD in them that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: unknowingly is limiting us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most of what people are smoking has
CBD in some concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's mainly what is in a lot
of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a multipoly hybrid with CBD in almost
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good food for thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to one of the questions
we normally start the interview off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Mexican varieties like Michoacan,
Verde de Limon.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Devil's Skunk, Devil's Tit,
which is Durban Poison Acapulco Gold C99.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a wonderful strain, super potent,
wonderful taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be absolutely too potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concentrates will freak you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember taking two hits at the Emerald
Cup and I was in a fetal position for
[SPEAKER_02]: several hours just hoping for myself to
come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very uncomfortable for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was from concentrates made from
the Devil's Tit, which I tried to get
[SPEAKER_02]: judged that year, but all my samples for
some reason never got judged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the last time I put any of
these samples in the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the idea being in the fetal
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed online that the Devil's Tit,
as well as the Purple Pantera,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the more popular lines that popped
up a lot on the various forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was interesting to me was that,
given the diversity of the genetics you
[SPEAKER_00]: work with, do you ever feel like you can
predict the winners or what's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the fan favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it really just a bit up in the air?
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: One year we entered in the Purple
Pineapple Bomb, which is pineapple tie and
[SPEAKER_02]: great crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a great high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, it wasn't our most
potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the thing we're most proud of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes it just depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes if something is familiar to
people, but different enough to go,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, wow, this is actually quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those usually seem to be the ones that
people gravitate to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got to be something familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has that modern profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looks that people want, that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then amazing high to go along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not always the most potent,
the most unique, the best in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people dislike something that's
familiar as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on the other end of the spectrum,
so to speak, I noticed that the Railgun
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like such a super fun mix of
genetics at a Sativa lovers party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that came quite a hefty 100
plus day flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me wondering, do these sort of
strains ever get out there that much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it really quite difficult to find
people willing to run it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, some of these strains were
created in testing rounds where I was
[SPEAKER_02]: growing different varieties and then we
grow them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And initially I didn't make a lot of seed
because we're testing out these varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what people get out there is not too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just not a lot available because
of the breeding practices, because a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of preservation was being done,
which takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're spending a year and a half on one
strain trying to do selections and
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get a lot of time to create
other varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of these strains are just not a
lot available.
[SPEAKER_02]: For people to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to work out the stuff that's
more popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to go back to those and do
larger selections for people so they can
[SPEAKER_02]: get exposed to these varieties,
which are quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Devil's Tit, the Dragon's Fire,
the West Coast Purple Diesel, Blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: Blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just try to make stuff available to people
that this is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of varieties that I've
made that just knock people's socks off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just need to go back and make more
of it available to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, God, I can only imagine you've got
such a catalogue of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, look, I'm going to be a
stickler here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really keen on the Railgun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me what it's like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Railgun is trippy, very high dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the Zimala in it, which has got,
you know, like South Indian flavors and
[SPEAKER_02]: highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be noid-inducing where you can kind
of get panic attacks, but it's also very
[SPEAKER_02]: euphoric and very desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like walking the edge of
being super uncomfortable, but really high
[SPEAKER_02]: and really flying high and being in like a
roller coaster dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good, but it's kind of hard to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the flowers are actually pretty dense
due to the Angola Red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of gives you nice, good flowers
that yield well, but also retaining a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of those long flowering highs from these
Zimala lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you ever try the Zimala in its
pure form?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a bit of a cult following to it,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quite a few, three to five
different Zimala varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all kind of, you know,
Malay, Thai, Indonesian, Indian,
[SPEAKER_02]: South Indian derived, but it's a French
island.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of variability depending
on what part of the island it's from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the Zimala by itself is really
trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds are hard to germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, they seem to lose
viability quite quick, quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to keep around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to renew and refresh the stock
quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting trait you really
don't hear about very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some varieties will last longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's due to the seed coats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are more dense and seem to
allow the seed to last longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other ones will be more shallow,
less density to it, smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they seem like they dry out quicker or
they just are more susceptible to heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just lose viability a lot faster
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me curious now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupata, how do you store your seeds and
how do you germinate them?
[SPEAKER_02]: For storage, for what people get,
it's a cool, dry place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people are flying.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you store in a refrigerator,
whenever you take it out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: refrigerator, you need to germinate those
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't, the moisture that seems to
come from the refrigerator will actually
[SPEAKER_02]: make them unviable quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you refrigerate anything,
you can keep them in there for quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to try to not use desiccants
because desiccants will work for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after a period of time, they will go
bad and actually pull more moisture into
[SPEAKER_02]: where those seeds are being kept,
fouling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you use a refrigerator,
once you remove from the refrigerator,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to put them right back as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're out with, you know,
for more than an hour or so, then you
[SPEAKER_02]: would want to germinate them as soon as
possible because they lose viability quite
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also long-term storage for
varieties that you want to keep for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to freeze them and they need to
be wrapped within glass vials,
[SPEAKER_02]: within rice, within coffee containers,
and then frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to make sure those are thawed
out, but don't retain moisture as you're
[SPEAKER_02]: thawing them out because that moisture
will cause issues with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the majority of what people get is
from a cool, dry place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germination, now I am recommending what's
called chemical scarification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you use hydrogen peroxide 3%
with water 50-50.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the stuff you buy at the
stores, at least in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: is 3% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mix it 50-50 with tap water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tap water in the United States has some
bleaching agents, which is good because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a disinfectant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hydrogen peroxide is a disinfectant,
so you could also use bottled water or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you want to use water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea is you want something that
will disinfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hydrogen peroxide will help soften the
shells of the seeds, causing what they
[SPEAKER_02]: call scarification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it softens it and also disinfects it
because the sources that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: getting these seeds from, especially if
they're from outside their country.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're from outside the country,
I would recommend freezing whatever seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: you get, at least overnight, and then
defrosting them and make sure they dry out
[SPEAKER_02]: without any moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you freeze the seeds, you're killing
the eggs, the larvae, and any live adults
[SPEAKER_02]: that may be coming along for the ride with
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't realize that a lot
of the critters and stuff that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting are from seeds they're getting
from outside the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these could destroy your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could, you know, eat up all your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, within a period of time,
you'll find little webbing inside the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, and they'll be eaten from the
inside out as they, you know, devour your
[SPEAKER_02]: priceless seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So freezing it is a good way of killing
them, and then you can store them for
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever period of time you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germination, once you've done the chemical
scarification, you want to wash with tap
[SPEAKER_02]: water or bottled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, running water is usually best,
and then you dry them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend using a paper towel with tap
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then checking on the seeds with a
moist paper towel wrapped and folded and
[SPEAKER_02]: then placed inside a sealed baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can place that in a cool,
dry place or with a heating mat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you check on the seeds maybe every
eight hours until germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you want to make sure that you wash
your hands with soap and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't touch your face or your body because
there's bacteria, there's different
[SPEAKER_02]: funguses that could be incorporated from
your body, and then you can contaminate
[SPEAKER_02]: your seeds so they'll mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you use a heating mat, I recommend
only using it for maybe 24 hours to 48
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the heat and moisture will cause
mold over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So heat will help push along the
germination process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would quit using that after a couple
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also some heating mats that you
can adjust and use a lower heat setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have one that has adjustable
setting, then you could use lower heat and
[SPEAKER_02]: use it for a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have a heating mat that you
just plug in and you have no ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: adjust the heat, then I would use it for
more than 24 to 48 hours tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But checking on it every eight hours or
your seeds until they germinate,
[SPEAKER_02]: up to three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after three days, I recommend using a
fingernail or maybe something to open up
[SPEAKER_02]: the seed cases, and then removing the film
that's around the embryo of the seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then sowing the seeds in a sterilized
soil starter soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a soilless medium or a medium that's
been sterilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sterilization is, I recommend
something for strutting seeds because of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's called damp off.
[SPEAKER_02]: These seeds or seedlings haven't built
resistance yet to fungus and bacteria that
[SPEAKER_02]: are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is great for growing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if these plants haven't built the
resistance to them yet, they will cause
[SPEAKER_02]: damp off and they'll die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people are killing their seeds
and don't realize it because they're using
[SPEAKER_02]: recycled soil, or they're using bagged
soil that's been opened several times,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has created fungal development,
which isn't great for these seedlings and
[SPEAKER_02]: seed embryos.
[SPEAKER_02]: An easy way of sterilizing your soil is
taking your medium and placing it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: turkey bag or oven bag and then moistening
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so it's soaking wet, but so it's moist
and damp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then basically put it in a microwave
for two minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do this three to four times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the fourth time, you seal the
bag with the little zip tie that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moisture that's in the bag will steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sterilize the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that last zap of the microwave is
three to four minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to kind of estimate it or
guesstimate it due to the shrinks of the
[SPEAKER_02]: microwave.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that steam will help kill any of the
harmful pathogens in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good stuff will come back within a
minute or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not destroying what's in the
soil for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just killing the bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you want to use for seed
starting or for a seedling transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or planting plants in general,
because there's nothing bad in it at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you sow the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I like to use natural light to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once they've come above the
ground, then I use T5 fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, veg them until you're ready
to transplant them to beer cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you veg them with whatever light
regimen that you want to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light regimen that I use for vegging
plants is 13 hours of light in a 24-hour
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use 12 hours from, say, 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: to 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 12 hours straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the middle of the dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So five and a half hours after the lights
have gone off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have 12 hours of lights on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: to 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then five and a half hours of
darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lights will come out for one hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, like in the middle of the
night, the lights come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that hour of light,
the lights go back off for another five
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the cycle is repeated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, that hour of light in the
middle of the dark period tricks the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in thinking that the days are
longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Longer days will keep plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a good way of saving on
electric bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a good way of transitioning when
you go to flower the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not much change from veg to
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: For flowering plants and sexing plants,
I basically use 10 and a half hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: light and 13 and a half hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dark period is actually what triggers
flowering, not the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 10 and a half hours is kind of the
right ratio that you need for extreme
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sex most plants within three to
four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more extreme would be seven to 10
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most flower, most things you can sex
within three to four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I use for germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very detailed answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess for me, the natural progression is
tell me how you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a soil guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the rundown?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like using organic methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun grown is my my preferred method,
but I like to do my selections indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: To speed along things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I sex plants basically after
the first true leaves, I actually use what
[SPEAKER_02]: they call the FIM technique, which allows
you to do a topping of the main stem and
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving two thirds left over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that, you're able to create not
only just from topping like two different
[SPEAKER_02]: branches, but sometimes three to four.
[SPEAKER_02]: The optimal is four different main
branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that one pinching and when you pinch
the apical buds, the main stem of your
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant, it causes what are called
auxins to go from the the top of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: down to the roots and will cause the roots
to grow more.
[SPEAKER_02]: This needs to be repeated babes basically
every four to five days or three to four
[SPEAKER_02]: days, depending on the growth rate of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time you do this, you're
creating more main branches and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: also creating more roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do this in veg as I'm waiting for the
plants to get to the right size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from seed for like indicus and
multipoly hybrids from seed to flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to veg the plants from 30 to 60
days for like indicus and hybrids for
[SPEAKER_02]: longer flowering, tropicals and
equatorials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to veg the plants from 60 to 90
days from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your thoughts on selection of
males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like to do it based on that initial
when you're sexing them or do you wait
[SPEAKER_00]: longer?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you select males?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I look for is under natural light
when you're sprouting plants under natural
[SPEAKER_02]: light, there is like a day or two which
the sprout will flash certain traits like
[SPEAKER_02]: colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can see a flash of red or purple
in the sprouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they first come up above ground,
just for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of indication what they'll
do in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually do your selections for
colors that way, picking up the special
[SPEAKER_02]: plants early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to waste your time growing out
of these different plants to get those
[SPEAKER_02]: special plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you basically indicate like this one
had red traits, this one had purple
[SPEAKER_02]: traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you're vegging it,
you kind of see that when you maturely
[SPEAKER_02]: flower them out, you can see how as a
little sprout, this told you that this is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a super colorful plant and
will have these special traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: For selecting males and females,
there's three types of DNA that's used in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like the cellular DNA,
which is like the structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you see outwardly,
you know, the structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like the female side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So females, you want to see the structure,
you want to make sure that they have good
[SPEAKER_02]: branching, lots of branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they're not branchy,
there's kind of hempy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's no, not a lot of branching,
it's more of a hemp plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of all stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want super branchy plants for your
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also you want to look at the
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to pull off the pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of repotting, so I get to
examine the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you want plants that produce good root
zones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want a little teeny carrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go through growing a plant
for nine months and then seeing that it
[SPEAKER_02]: has a small little carrot of a root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why your plant, you know,
sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're breeding and you're
selecting for these plants, you kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the root zone, make sure they're
prolific, either growing sideways or
[SPEAKER_02]: downward, or they're good roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you got 20 or 50 plants you're
selecting from, and there's no real way of
[SPEAKER_02]: like telling the difference between the
plants from like the top up, but the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: will tell you which ones will grow better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that is kind of like the
mitochondrial DNA, the ability for it to
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake nutrients and then convert that in
the sugars into energy, ATP, same as
[SPEAKER_02]: humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans take sugars from mitochondria,
and they'll switch the sugars into ATP,
[SPEAKER_02]: adenosine triphosphate, which is energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis has this mitochondrial DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is something that you can see
through the way it converts sugars and
[SPEAKER_02]: creates stem and growth of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing to look for is the
chloroplast DNA, what creates the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, the cannabinoids, the plants
that create the carotenoids, those like
[SPEAKER_02]: the colors in the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I look for colorful plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like reds and purples because
they have these flavonoids and different
[SPEAKER_02]: things that impart certain terpenes and
cannabinoids that make certain plants
[SPEAKER_02]: special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only for flavors and taste,
but the highs associated along with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stems, I rub them using like a piece of
paper or something other than your
[SPEAKER_02]: fingers, because you smell one plant and
you smell another plant, they kind of mix
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you use a piece of paper,
you can kind of smell the aroma of that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's pungent or stringent,
or if it affects the nasal passageways,
[SPEAKER_02]: it affects a certain different ways
because of those long chain terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles I was talking about before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those long chain terpenes are something
that are kind of unknown, but your body
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of recognizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have this certain experience by
smelling the aroma of that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: that one's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of mark that this one's got
this special aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a resin profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got good roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's branchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that is good to select
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: For males, I kind of do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look for the large root zones,
the branchy ones, and the ones that have
[SPEAKER_02]: different color content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a bunch of males and some
of them have, you know, petioles that have
[SPEAKER_02]: purple in them, but there's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the plant is green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one has purple petioles,
but it has purple stems, and the sepals
[SPEAKER_02]: are purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that one's got a higher quantity of
color to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one might be chosen over one that
has just green effects because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing really you can pick from it other
than the colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are just a few things that I use
for the selection criteria, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: resin content.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the type of trichomes on
males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a male that has trichome
production on the sepals, of the male
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, I call them flowers, but they're
the male projections that drop the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see resin on them, then that's also
a good trait, especially if they have
[SPEAKER_02]: different colors on the resins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Neville's Haze Purple Tie F3 male
that I use for some of my lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: it had purple resin trichomes on the
males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of an added cool thing that
I like to see in the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a comprehensive rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I feel like that's becoming my go-to
saying for this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to come up with something
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But following on with that, I wanted to
ask just a few of the common things we
[SPEAKER_00]: hear nowadays about selection,
like if you agree with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that comes to mind is DJ
Short always loved to say that he wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: the more sativa of the two parents to be
the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you feel like there's any sort of
correlation with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mine might be the reverse of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with me, I think the females are what
you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want it to look a certain way,
you want the female to be that impression.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want the potency and qualities,
that comes from the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for males, I look for the ones that are
the stinkiest to have the more branching
[SPEAKER_02]: and the color So colors, branching and
root development for the male is what I
[SPEAKER_02]: think parts qualities and potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the female adds the looks and
some of the smells to the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see potency and qualities come from the
males and structures and the way to use
[SPEAKER_02]: those like the mitochondrial DNA from the
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some mitochondrial DNA and cellular DNA
from the males, mostly mitochondrial and
[SPEAKER_02]: cellular DNA for the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I actually are sub cool said
something along the same lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting to hear that that's
a line there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sort of noticed that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also forgot to mention that other
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about your light
cycle, you know, shout out the gas lantern
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't hear about it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's cool to hear you're rocking it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a modified gas lantern?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's I use it for the veg period to
fool the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the flowering cycle is something I've
developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way I've developed it is the
reason I use 10 and a half, 13 and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: hours of darkness is that plants are
growing in Hawaii or at the equator aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: stimulated by you know, longer periods of
dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you use too much dark period,
it doesn't actually cause the plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow any faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tried to think if I was a plant at
the equator or Hawaii or other place on
[SPEAKER_02]: Earth, what would work in all these
different places?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 13 and a half hours of darkness
works in nature, but it also works for all
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants to kind of give you the right
ratio of light and darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I just loop you back to one of the
other common breeding selection tips we
[SPEAKER_00]: hear, what's your thoughts on the old stem
rub?
[SPEAKER_02]: Stem rub is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that gives you the aromas and the
stuff that you should be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the more pungent or aromatic
that the line is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it if it basically makes you feel like
a certain way, then that that is something
[SPEAKER_02]: special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our chemistry is evolved with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, our endocannabinoid system is
evolved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So either it's evolved with us or we
evolved with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's intrinsic to human development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have an aroma that does
something to you with certain plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something specific in that
chemical compound profile that is
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting you in whatever special way is
it, you know, the primary terpenes with
[SPEAKER_02]: the long chain terpenes profile,
along with the cannabinoids that affect
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a flavonoid with those terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's combination all the above.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the stuff that we need to do more
studies on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just haven't haven't had the
funding and the right people to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess a question I wanted to ask you,
given like the amount of diversity there
[SPEAKER_00]: is within your clone library, when you
finally do go to make a new cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you approach it as very conceptual,
like you sort of map out on paper or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: more of like let's mix and match and then
sort of go from there based on what feels
[SPEAKER_00]: good?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you approach breeding new crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I there's a lot of work that goes in
that no one ever sees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of stuff written down of
what would be great to work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's projects within projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll I'll attempt to grow out a bunch
of varieties that I'm working for a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that project may go ahead because
I've gotten the males and females that I
[SPEAKER_02]: want with the, you know, the varieties
that I need to create that project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, another project may be delayed
because I'm not getting the plants that I
[SPEAKER_02]: need for that project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of it's written down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's mapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the seeds are grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quantities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all written down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have map after map of seed trays of all
these different varieties and growing out
[SPEAKER_02]: these varieties for certain projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them don't get to fruition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you're growing them,
you know, shit happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants die.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's damp off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's birds that might destroy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a child that goes in and
pulls up plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a light falls down on the
plants, killing those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can't help life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't always plan for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these happen because you're
just trying to make the best thing
[SPEAKER_02]: possible with what you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times there are attempts at
preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't do preservation,
there's conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if conservation is not possible,
meaning you have only like two plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just trying to do what you can with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can't do that, then you make
something special with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that gets, you know,
that's kind of like with what you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to make special, whatever things
you can make as special as possible with
[SPEAKER_02]: what you have available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what sort of things can we expect to
see coming out and how long away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's the haze project that we
talked about, and that's been in works for
[SPEAKER_02]: several years already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were taking like the best varieties
that we've been growing over the years and
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like going, yeah, this line would
be great for the haze project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd, you know, put that aside and
then work on other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been steadily going through the
different varieties, picking out the best
[SPEAKER_02]: plants for the haze project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're making our crosses with the
best plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're also, once we've done that
individually, we're doing them with each
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we send each other these different
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the haze projects are for the near
future and the later future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there should be some stuff coming out
that will be kind of pre-haze project
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that will be released.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of that should be picked up if a
person can, because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: special in itself, as well as what will be
coming later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be, I don't want to jinx
myself, but there's going to be like a
[SPEAKER_02]: hash haze line, but it's basically called
Mirage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically using the best hash lines
to make like a hash haze, but it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: different hash production varieties from
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Kashmir, Persian, Turkish,
Lebanese, Afghani, just using the best
[SPEAKER_02]: hash producing varieties and creating like
a haze version of that, but not haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a hash mix of the best plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate tie, I'm trying to bring back
several different chocolate ties,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as different tie varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I expect different tie stick varieties,
as well as chocolate ties and other ties
[SPEAKER_02]: to be available at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican varieties, I'm trying to bring
back some of the heirloom varieties that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first generation were like saving
the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people go, I grew one plant
and it wasn't what I wanted from the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one plant is going to give you one
variability in a line that needs work and
[SPEAKER_02]: saving in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people will get to experience these
Mexican varieties that give you happiness
[SPEAKER_02]: and awesome effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're growing one plant,
you're only getting one aspect of the
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes you need to grow out more
than one plant, sorry guys, you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow out more than one plant to experience
the line and save if you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some plants will give you, or some
lines will give you several plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are wonderful and great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of them that are absolutely
stellar just comes out from a few more
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all the times do you have to grow out
a hundred plants to get these wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's a preservation or a
conservation, it's only been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one year, say the seeds were from the
sixties or seventies and they were,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maintained, but barely
maintained.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that first year of saving it,
you're not going to get the best plants
[SPEAKER_02]: while you are the grower and growing these
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may need another generation or two
before those beautiful expressions,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best expressions of the line come out
for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be working on bringing
some, you know, lines like the Acapulco
[SPEAKER_02]: gold and others to make it more something
that people remember as being that awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke that they had back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other things are going to be some
Hawaiian varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to bring that, bring more of
those available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were unknown Hawaiian
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say they were Maui Waui
or Puna Butter or something else,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I didn't know, but they could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are fantastic Hawaiian lines,
but I just, I'm going to say the timeframe
[SPEAKER_02]: it was from, the island it may have been
sourced from and leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you as growers, can,
you know, decide what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to butter it up any more
than I know already, but there's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be some heirloom Hawaiians coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several different Mexicans, some of the
haze, purple haze, Colombian, golds,
[SPEAKER_02]: reds, wacky weed, Vietnamese black,
Vietnamese Delat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Vietnamese haze I'm making,
which is basically five different
[SPEAKER_02]: Vietnamese heirloom strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all like land race heirloom mixed
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one's going to be special for
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get these, you know, psychedelic
flowers that are, you know, racy to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, purple and colorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are candelabra style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are like weeping willow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be a lot of
expressions, a lot of cool stuff for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mexicans, Colombians, Thais,
Hawaiians, and then the hash lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's going to be some of my
other lines that I need to refresh will be
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a lot of African stuff coming
in the near future, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like the Indian varieties,
I'll be coming after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Afghanis, I'm also doing some
Afghani lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much, but you can only do
so much, but I'm trying to preserve as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as making these lines as much as I
can before it's too late because they
[SPEAKER_02]: become a viable pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can't maintain the seed stock,
then it'll go bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to maintain them for
everybody's future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I don't do it, who knows who
will?
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, I'm just trying to make more
stuff available for people while I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very noble act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all very appreciative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst all those all-star names you
mentioned, you referenced the Black
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnamese.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a few questions about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you just give us an overview of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears to be quite a fan favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the Vietnamese Black was
more of a jungly weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more from not the southern portion
of Vietnam, but more from not quite the
[SPEAKER_02]: China border, but something that was near
the Isan province, but more inside of
[SPEAKER_02]: Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Vietnam, they've had a huge line of
loss of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's from the communism
there, but there isn't a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even 20 years ago, there was a lot more
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's really hard to find anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of genetic loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike Thailand that's had a resurgent,
Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam has lost a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: their lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Vietnam Black was a jungle weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere around the same latitude as the
Isan area of Thailand, which is more of
[SPEAKER_02]: the northeastern portion of Thailand,
which borders Laos and Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a special area there,
but more so on the Vietnamese side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a thin peninsula,
kind of like Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the varieties that are now there
are from the southern portion around the
[SPEAKER_02]: south.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Da Lat, there's really nothing there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, his family is indigenous from
that part of Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an indigenous Vietnamese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went looking for stuff through his
cousins and family, and he wasn't able to
[SPEAKER_02]: find anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare and hard to find now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've been able to preserve is
kind of like last remnants of what was
[SPEAKER_02]: there at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Vietnam, they used to have a huge
cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of what happens with making
things illegal over time has caused a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of eradication throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that eradication happened in the
1930s.
[SPEAKER_02]: After alcohol prohibition was changed
over, they decided to make cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they got that notion from the
apartheid movement in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the anti-drug laws that were
created were to control people in South
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that were slaves that were
freed were controlled by use of creating
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis being illegal, because a lot of
the native people were smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they made those illegal to try to
control people then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the 1930s, the United States
incorporated some of that to also control
[SPEAKER_02]: the Mexicans and the Black people in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through trying to scare the public into
thinking they were rapists from consuming
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of literature put out there
that was just totally false, just trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to scare people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a way of controlling people and
to force them to go to a different
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at that time, the stock market had
crashed and people were scared of losing
[SPEAKER_02]: their jobs and didn't have money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they went to picking on people from
neighboring Mexico or in some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: poorer regions of the Americas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, unfortunately, caused the United
States to incorporate those laws,
[SPEAKER_02]: which forced other countries like India
that had a huge cannabis history and
[SPEAKER_02]: long-reaching cannabis history to make
things illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that forced all the different
countries around the world to create the
[SPEAKER_02]: drug laws that they have now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them have reversed themselves
like they have in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very sort of checkered history,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this would be a good point to jump
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the current state
of legalization and what's your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: on the future of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that we're going to move to a
model where the average home grower slash
[SPEAKER_00]: small producers pushed out and saw
corporate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, unfortunately, a lot of the laws
that we as a democracy, we vote for
[SPEAKER_02]: things, but they get changed after we vote
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the lawmakers change what we vote for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of stuff is not what the people
had voted for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is sad because it forces out a
lot of people that could be growing it for
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, for small farms, for small
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can create a lot of things for
textiles, for cement, for medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many uses for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, when these laws are
voted on, they're changed by companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that buy out these lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then no one's happy except the people
that have money to be able to circumvent
[SPEAKER_02]: these laws and establish businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the state of things is not very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legalization would be great, but the
people need to be able to grow what they
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for people that can't grow what
they can, they need other people to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there needs to be outlets for people to
get their cannabis grown for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there needs to be studies on this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to be able to use this for
pain medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or for PTSD, uses for sleep, anxiety,
depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many medical uses for different
ratios of cannabis and the different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids that can be useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the laws need to be changed where more
of that is available for people to study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less of the big businesses need to get
less availability to what the typical man
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there should be equal laws,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the world, it seems like
legalization is kind of opening up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully, I have great hope that
around the world, we will get to a point
[SPEAKER_02]: where we're in a better state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, it's kind of all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am hopeful that people will get
together and vote for something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: truly helpful for the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we could be offsetting global
warming if we grew enough plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be changing a lot of these things
that are being used for wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be growing cannabis for
construction uses, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just converted it to cannabis,
fuels, textiles, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food, nutrients, supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to make more use of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that was my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only hope that governments around
the world adopt more of an open view on
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess on the more individual level,
I'd love to ask, as we do a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, what would be your advice for
someone who's just looking to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, to take their game a bit more
seriously?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say to them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say just grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you grow, the more experience you
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try not to take what you read in these
books as fact, because there's a lot of BS
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff that people just
regurgitated that's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take experience for what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow out the plants and get your
experience first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and breed and make some plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do some selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to grow out hundreds of
thousands of plants to do some breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not helpful to take stressed out
plants, do pollen chucks with clones that
[SPEAKER_02]: you got from somewhere, from someone,
and then try to push those out to
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else, because those multipoly
hybrid pollen chucks are just not helpful
[SPEAKER_02]: to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then getting clones from everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should grow more stuff from
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing selections yourself, selecting
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be done more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's relying on other people to do
the work for them so they get these
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many more potent strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many high qualities that people
are just not experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say people don't experience a lot of
the different highs and qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they're doing these clones
that everybody else is growing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're only getting what other people
are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're growing stuff from seed,
they can create their own clones from
[SPEAKER_02]: these lines and have special plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find one pack of seed and get some very,
very good traits out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to grow out the plants and
experience them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't be afraid of growing plants for
a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best plants aren't the fastest plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't kill plants that need some
nurturing, because those plants usually
[SPEAKER_02]: are the best plants if you just give them
the time to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the ugly duckling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might look weird and offset,
but it'll grow out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll grow out of those weird traits at
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it's established itself,
you get these beautiful plants that you
[SPEAKER_02]: get to experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grow all the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't kill everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just because a plant is experiencing
intersex traits doesn't mean that they got
[SPEAKER_02]: bad seeds or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually that's a sign that they're under
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're being overwatered or there's
too much nitrogen in the soil or there's
[SPEAKER_02]: insects invading and chewing out their
roots or sucking the life out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're telling you there's something
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually figure out what that problem is
and then remedy the problem and then keep
[SPEAKER_02]: growing that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the real thing is for breeders that
are trying to get into it, just grow the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some great advice there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely get behind that,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do some cool stuff even if you're
not popping hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I would love to quickly ask you
though, if someone wanted to try to up
[SPEAKER_00]: their game a bit, maybe take on a more raw
line, you know, like try to filial breed
[SPEAKER_00]: some Thai seeds or something, you know,
like have a good go at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many seeds do you think they should
run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Given we know you tend to need to run
through a few more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of number would you throw right
there is like just a ballpark figure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a line is raw and there's no
selections done, you're going to need a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a person has done a preservation and
there's done selections over a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: generations or if it's a true breeding
strain that's, you know, been preserved,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll need less seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a person's worked the line,
you may only need a pack of 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: but 20 is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you, if you got a raw seed line
that, you know, you're going to need
[SPEAKER_02]: selections, you might need 30,
50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends, but you can still grow out
those plants from a small selection,
[SPEAKER_02]: make more seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from those seeds, you have a lot
more seeds to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can work with 10 to 20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take you a little longer,
you know, use all the males, females,
[SPEAKER_02]: grow those out, make seed from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have thousands of seeds to
select from.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is when you get that many
plants is what do you select after that
[SPEAKER_02]: point?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just gets to be where there's
so many plants that it's hard to make the
[SPEAKER_02]: selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really don't need thousands of
plants unless you're doing full large
[SPEAKER_02]: scale breeding practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you can narrow it down to,
you know, 10, 15 females, four to six
[SPEAKER_02]: males, and you can do a lot of good
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, as long as you have,
um, you're selected for certain things,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, branchy plants, you know,
things that are have odor resin
[SPEAKER_02]: production, good roots, um, you'll do
well, you know, but there should be a goal
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with the breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should, you should do it to improve
the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: There shouldn't be just, you know,
crossing this and that because it's cool
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, what's the use of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but if you're, if you really want to
do some breeding, you should have an end
[SPEAKER_02]: goal, you know, you want to, um,
take a line that grows small and make it
[SPEAKER_02]: grow big, but keeping the same type of
quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, a nice goal to have for
a lot of people, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only reach what you aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in your work that you've
incorporated deep chunk into a few of your
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it sort of fits that category
of preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on Tom Hill's line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might've used one, a long, long time ago
with some purple bubble Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I don't usually use deep chunk
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep chunk is very, um, uh, it,
it stomps all over the genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning it, um, it takes over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a good quality, um,
indica broadleaf hash plant Afghani,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, more of like a Mazari Sharif
shorter, uh, but larger flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, but not too tall chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding material because you can kind of,
you know, what you're going to get out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you breathe something into it and
you see those traits, you can kind of see
[SPEAKER_02]: what, um, what the other line imparts into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a, it's a good training line for
breeding, I guess, because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have any experience with any of
these other lines like pine tar Kush X 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: his haze?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I actually, I took the pine tar Kush
and I bred it into the, um, so trolley and
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred that into the OG Kush project I
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I did that was I wanted to
impart real Kush into the modern OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people grew out my varieties,
they couldn't say, Oh, there's no real
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush in it because it imparts both lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew out those, um, the pine tar
Kush, um, which is, it's pretty good line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of has an Afghani look to it,
but it's Pakistani, um, has a good aroma
[SPEAKER_02]: profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, the, the stable breeds from
Tom Hill's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, uh, Tom Hill's got some good
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The X 18 was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I said, uh, Pakistani line,
similar to the citrulli, um, lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: different aromas, fruit flavors,
um, nice stuff, uh, not overly potent,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a good breeding material, kind of good
to kind of breed with other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you just touched on OG a
moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done quite a few different crosses
with different OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd love to hear your take on the
different OGs, if you have a preferred one
[SPEAKER_00]: and how some of those crosses turned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so when I was growing for the medical
clubs in the early two thousands,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, we were growing, uh, what was
available in Northern California and then
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it to the medical clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medical clubs wanted OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the medical clubs that I went to,
they would take, uh, their OG Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings and they would have thousand
watt, uh, HPS, um, high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_02]: lights growing under each plant lollipop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so huge lights, lots of energy,
you know, huge electric bills and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and rooms just with these,
um, you know, small plants producing not a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole lot, but, uh, it was worth it to
them because they were, people were buying
[SPEAKER_02]: it for high dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but they, they didn't yield with the
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they, they grew poorly rooted poorly,
uh, because most of them were derived from
[SPEAKER_02]: like bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's bag seed was, Oh, this was some
really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they grew it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, usually from like, you know,
stressed out situations, it, it hermed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so there's stability issues with it,
but the smoke was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I decided, I asked the,
the, one of the guys that place was a G
[SPEAKER_02]: three collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an upland, uh, Southern California,
and, um, they're, they try to fight the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the state and the DA and lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but anyway, uh, I asked him,
what are the two lines that, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: have the highest quality flowers that you
guys love, but don't yield much and don't
[SPEAKER_02]: root well, I'll, I'll breed these and,
and improve them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he gave me the socal, socal G 13
cut and the, um, uh, the true Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, these, these are the best we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'd wish they'd yield more and I wish
they rooted better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I basically bred, um, my idea was
to breed the modern Kush with real Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I decided that I didn't like to
reverse anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, you know, reversing the pollen,
you have unstable plants, you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't make anything stable from
instability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I decided to reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use real males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used the, so trolley, which is a
Pakistani, uh, line, um, with the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, pine tar Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found a male that was more Afghani
land race looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use that to pollinate, um,
the true Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, I, I basically grew
up 50 plants and I selected the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, males and females.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I worked down from 50 plants down to
like 17 females down to like, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: nine males.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally worked out to the best 10
females and, uh, four best males.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it worked out to the last,
uh, three males and the last seven
[SPEAKER_02]: females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I bred those to create the,
what I call true gangster Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those two males, I also, uh,
used to breed, uh, to the other OG Kush's
[SPEAKER_02]: that was, I was growing out and I,
over, uh, several years of going to all
[SPEAKER_02]: the clubs I collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the different OG Kush's from the San
Fernando Valley Kush, the Skywalker,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the Hells Angels OG, which is not the
same as my Hells Angel line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's also the Diablo OG,
um, the abusive OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was the Fire OG for Northern
California and the SoCal Fire OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NorCal Fire OG was a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there was a lot of other OG's and,
uh, you know, Master Kush and different
[SPEAKER_02]: lines I grew at the same time,
Tahoe OG, um, trying to find the best
[SPEAKER_02]: OG's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my, my selection criteria was finding
the most potent, highest quality OG's,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the same time I was trying to find
ones that grew well, um, and rooted well
[SPEAKER_02]: for the breeding purposes, because,
um, ones that would produce really good
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, uh, but didn't grow very well
weren't worth it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I excluded the San Fernando Valley
Kush because it didn't grow very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a short little plant, producing
wonderful great buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from what I was trying to do,
uh, it didn't cut the mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, though I'd like to go back and do some
breeding with it, but not at the time
[SPEAKER_02]: because it wasn't what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best cuttings that I found were,
um, the NorCal Fire OG, uh, and OG Kush we
[SPEAKER_02]: got from the Hells Angels in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, um, at the time, 27 year old cut
that they had, they just called it OG
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I used that line to create the Hells
Angel line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I also grew out the, uh, Skywalker OG,
um, which was the best one I felt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just did the trick every time,
every time he smoked it, it just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, check all the different
boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the Abusive OG was another one that
was very good yielding, also high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the two, the best one was the OG Kush
we got from the Hells Angels and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were my two favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the Tahoe was also a larger yielding
good OG, um, but not quite as good as the
[SPEAKER_02]: Skywalker and the OG Kush we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the Fire OG out of SoCal was not very
good yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of wiry and it was good,
good buds, but it just wasn't growing very
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NorCal Fire OG, um, yielded very well
and had, you know, the same good
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics as the SoCal one,
but it was just a better plant in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I did some breeding with that to
make the, uh, the, uh, uh, OG Purple Fire
[SPEAKER_02]: timeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, Skywalker, the Abusive,
uh, the OG Kush, we, we made different
[SPEAKER_02]: lines with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had bred with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unfortunately I had a, um,
warehouse in Southern California,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, which I was using, um, when I came
down here to do some breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, uh, it got sabotaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the cuttings, all the different,
um, things I was doing to, to bulk,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the OG lines, the True Gangster Kush,
uh, project that I had done, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: was lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I only have a small amount of seed
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to revisit those for people,
but that, that whole OG project got
[SPEAKER_02]: squashed because of all the loss of all
those plants for reproduction and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different, uh, clones that I lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost, uh, Juiced Fruit Tie, um,
you know, the one, the, uh, various lines
[SPEAKER_02]: of Maui Waui, different things that,
uh, you know, I don't have anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bummer to hear you lost that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right at the end of the story,
you mentioned, yeah, you lost the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thought on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of come more to the forefront of
discussions with, um, a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's as good as what some
people make it out to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, I, I smoked it years ago and,
uh, but at the time, um, no, I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an earthquake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I didn't, I, I didn't know if
there was the Earthquake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the smoke that kind of hit me a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was kind of the combination of
the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's, it's definitely got,
um, it's a special potent weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely got some great qualities
to it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you have it, gang.
