[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
the podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_01]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by 420 Australia, your premier store
[SPEAKER_01]: for lifestyle and apparel, as well as OGS,
your number one store for all things
[SPEAKER_01]: organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the coming few episodes, we're going
to be doing a few catch up episodes and
[SPEAKER_01]: this one, we feature Jeremy of Builder
Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're ready to get all that organic
knowledge again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, so here we are again,
Builder Soil 2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Jeremy, for coming on
the show again and for spending the time
[SPEAKER_01]: with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting to coordinate this from
across the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same question as what we did last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you smoking on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I harvested most recently some
Angel back cross from Boneyard and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it was his back cross too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think he out crossed it with Blue
Cheese and Boneyard, his mail is basically
[SPEAKER_02]: the same for everything that he works with
and it's named after his father.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure the exact lineage off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like a lot of his crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, I also grew some
Northern Lights 5 Hayes crosses and they
[SPEAKER_02]: were interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds were really old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I popped them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really just kind of has an earthy odor,
nothing to get excited about, but it does
[SPEAKER_02]: pack a pretty good punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are the two that I have right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, overall, would you describe
yourself as more of like a sativa type of
[SPEAKER_01]: person or a more indica head?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that at this point, I'm more
attracted to something different,
[SPEAKER_02]: unique odors, unique flavors, something I
haven't had before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to have a little bit of
everything in my house based on the time
[SPEAKER_02]: of day, whether it's morning, whether I
got to work, whether I'm trying to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the benefits of having a
small home grow is you can grow as many
[SPEAKER_02]: different flavors as you want and yield
doesn't necessarily have to be at the
[SPEAKER_02]: forefront.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have kind of a bad seed habit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for my birthday, a couple of days ago,
I popped some new seeds and got a few
[SPEAKER_02]: different things in the greenhouse and
they're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that I don't really lean towards
sativa or indica one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as a little personal question,
do you keep clones at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I noticed you do really tend to
run different things every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you just kind of like enjoy it and
let it move on or do you keep stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: around?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been times where I've kept them
around for periods of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it seems like with family and
everything that I've got going on in my
[SPEAKER_02]: life, it's a lot easier to just pop seeds
when I want them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I started doing
when I keep clones, I have this feeling
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's taken away from me going through
a lot of the seeds that I'd like to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've always telling myself,
you know, one day I'm going to settle down
[SPEAKER_02]: and just get this one clone, this one
girl, and I'm just going to grow her the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can actually do some
comparative testing versus different runs,
[SPEAKER_02]: different lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's going to become more of
the build the soil test grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to always have my
personal seed runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, if I find something I
really like in the pack, then I'll go buy
[SPEAKER_02]: more, run them and then keep a clone
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another way to keep a clone that I've
found is to give it to a few different
[SPEAKER_02]: buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you ever want it back and they're
the types that, you know, are really good,
[SPEAKER_02]: they do a good job and we'll keep them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to expand your library
without having so many at your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as maybe like a little bit of a
finicky question, do you go to the effort
[SPEAKER_01]: of like researching the breeders and
seeing, you know, does this one breed
[SPEAKER_01]: their stuff in soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really the first and foremost
thing, but the epigenetic quality that I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, with vegetable seeds at our
build a soil shop, we carry locally
[SPEAKER_02]: produced seed from a similar altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's going to be best
for the local gardeners here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And similarly, if you have a gardener
that's going to be growing or cultivating
[SPEAKER_02]: in a certain style, I think that might be
the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess in general, in this episode,
I was kind of thinking we could maybe hit
[SPEAKER_01]: a few more advanced ideas than we did last
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think last episode we did a good
job of hitting most of the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I wanted to touch on,
because there's just, a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, kind of interest in it in
Australia, mammoth pea, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one of those products where it's
definitely appears to be one of those more
[SPEAKER_01]: high-end ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen, it tends to promote
like different growth styles from plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've seen plants where when it's used
on it, it promotes like really hard Fox
[SPEAKER_01]: tailing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some people that's maybe a bit of
a cause for concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also know other organic gurus,
so to speak, who say they won't touch it
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't consider it to be organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's a bit getting into the
semantics or do you feel it's a product
[SPEAKER_01]: worth getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be quite cost prohibitive if
nothing else.
[SPEAKER_02]: These products are really interesting and
they play on a few different things,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I feel from a business background
and from a marketing perspective are sure
[SPEAKER_02]: to be successful in sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that time is going to predict if
it's going to be sure to be successful in
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that people are using mammoth
pea and that they're experiencing a
[SPEAKER_02]: plethora of different results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's more to be learned
about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so depending on the soil recipe,
if we have a really high phosphorus mix,
[SPEAKER_02]: it may release an undesirably large amount
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so depending on the soil recipe,
that's something interesting to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we're looking at phosphorus,
when we started looking at some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: products, one of the things that was
interesting to me is like where you're at,
[SPEAKER_02]: for instance, phosphorus is a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the hydroponic nutrients are
actually different than the products that
[SPEAKER_02]: are sold here based on the phosphorus
being a prohibiting factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it becomes something that obviously
we want to be open to and have an open
[SPEAKER_02]: mind for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now as we're going to see more
products come on the market, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: most importantly, I would like to base it
on results.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just in thinking about it,
it makes sense from an agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective that phosphorus mobilization
is one of the lag binds that the synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients are able to contend with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the first time looking at acreage
grows and doing soil testing, when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: confronted with having to raise the
phosphorus levels and you need to do it in
[SPEAKER_02]: a short period of time without using
animal husbandry and cover crop and long
[SPEAKER_02]: term approaches, it becomes pretty clear
that it would be advantageous to have an
[SPEAKER_02]: organic way to either release phosphorus
or add phosphorus cost effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't necessarily mean just to feed
the plant, but maybe to balance the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we're operating with a balance of
potassium and phosphorus or whatever is
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable to the particular agronomist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm like, okay, it makes a lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You release phosphorus from these microbes
and there's white papers that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: study it and go over it, prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost side is very interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so mammoth pee, I haven't run all the
numbers on it, but that's one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: complaints that we hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there's been some discussions
about the type of microbes that may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: present and being dangerous or being
non-existent and it being just a hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everyone knows there's a lot of
conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to add to that, recently we carry
some products under the brand Rootwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a friend of mine,
legendary grower and farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been using biology for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he brought a product called Biofoss
just released last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, or I should say he did, and we got
our first order of it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're going to be going
with as opposed to something like mammoth
[SPEAKER_02]: pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is we want something to be
more of a complete soil support system
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of so singular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one is a mixture of different
microorganisms that will help liberate
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you start reading up on what's in
the package, you'll notice that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: them are just, for instance, one of the
largest ones in there is I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: Megaterium and that one is one of the
largest rod-shaped bacteria and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: an enzyme producer and it feeds the
phosphorus mobilizers that are in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to have to do some
side-by-side tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to really wrap my head
around this, but the writing is on the
[SPEAKER_02]: wall that the industry is moving towards
phosphorus solubizing instead of heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus applications, which makes a lot
of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that we're looking at
right now, if you want to try and play
[SPEAKER_02]: with this on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think over the next year,
I'll probably have a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I love to send you guys some stuff
all the way up there and see if we can
[SPEAKER_02]: make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But amino acids are really interesting and
we've got a freeze dried fish amino acid
[SPEAKER_02]: under the name Thrive.N Thriven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things the manufacturer has
been discussing with me is how they've
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed that when they use it with a
mineral calcium like Calphos and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: micronized and they use the two together,
the amino acids actually chelate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And release a much higher percentage of
the phosphorus to be available than would
[SPEAKER_02]: be without it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like we're on the cusp of a
few different things for phosphorus to be
[SPEAKER_02]: coming around the corner and organic
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what I feel like in the
discussions I'm having right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that's nice is if
you have typical no-till practices where
[SPEAKER_02]: you have earthworms and you have a
multilayer and you have products that have
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus in them, even in low amounts
and you're utilizing these processes,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with compost, which is usually
rich in phosphorus, I don't feel like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is imperative that we all
reach out to as far as a must have,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when you mentioned the COX
prohibitive side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that anybody who is doing this
as a hobby or anybody who's really serious
[SPEAKER_02]: about it is going to be wanting to try
these things and see personally if they
[SPEAKER_02]: make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: What has your experience been?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never used Mammoth Pea before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually haven't used it myself,
but I've used a similar product which uses
[SPEAKER_01]: what they described as a phosphorus
liberator in conjunction with a phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: solubilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's two microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said it's Azobacter and Bacillus
subtilis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like I actually got a little bit
of that foxtailing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from something where I'd never
observed foxtailing before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just wondering if maybe I had
expected to see that in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Confirm it like a false confirmation type
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was interesting was it struck
this idea in my mind of maybe the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't just to use some really exotic
testosterone type bacteria which is in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Pea, but instead to just use maybe
some more common ones like Azobacter and
[SPEAKER_01]: subtilis and just have a more symbiotic
relationship between the microbes in your
[SPEAKER_01]: pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that where we lack knowledge a lot
of times is we make up in diversity and we
[SPEAKER_02]: notice nature does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we're able to find a group or
consortium of different phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: solubizers that work, like in the RootWise
product or the one that you found over
[SPEAKER_02]: there or something a little more singular
like the Mammoth Pea, I think that right
[SPEAKER_02]: now the hard part is all these products
have either full transparency or no
[SPEAKER_02]: transparency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it's based on the
labeling loopholes, the labeling problems
[SPEAKER_02]: with the lack of knowledge of these
products and how they may affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and how they may affect the
consumer based on agricultural policies
[SPEAKER_02]: which affect multi-billion dollar,
multi-billion dollar crops depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: which state or which country they're
coming into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like you mentioned, I don't think
we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there's a lot of people
that have done a lot of research and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're able to narrow it down using the
scientific method, finding out which ones
[SPEAKER_02]: are best for phosphorus, create
phosphatase or whatever is most important
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like it's just the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only a few products out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's yet to be a dramatic shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's using silica or everybody uses
certain key products that we always talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about but I don't think so far it's really
penetrated 100% across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as the new products come out,
we'll be talking about them and we'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: as we do some build a soil test grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll do a side by side with and
without a phosphorus additive and see if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's any differences using the same
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we get a little bit more
comfortable around here, I'm thinking we
[SPEAKER_02]: can send that into the lab and get some
analysis that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as actual recommendation right
now, I think I would recommend you just
[SPEAKER_02]: trying it and not believing any of the
marketing claims unless you try it for
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also make sure that you're not wasting
a whole bunch of money on something that
[SPEAKER_02]: has no benefit by doing that trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last little question on phosphorus,
it's actually a bit of a tricky one to
[SPEAKER_01]: find down under because bone meal is
almost non-existent surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you recommend as a good
organic source of phosphorus for on scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've looked into brands that,
you know, like wheat brand, rice brand
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like it might be a viable option
given it, you know, like in terms of its
[SPEAKER_01]: overall profile, it seems to be phosphorus
heavy, but still nothing abundant outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of like guano, which a lot of people want
to avoid nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any minerals that are rich in
phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not in that area, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That you could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you consider that heavy in
phosphorus, but that's certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would consider feeding that through a
warm bin as a more specific type of feed
[SPEAKER_02]: to direct the amount available phosphorus
in the end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could use that, which has
been chelated through the process of
[SPEAKER_02]: enzyme and breakdown of the food web and
the warm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you'd have something that was,
instead of, you know, just a mineral
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus that may not be so
bioavailable, you now have something that
[SPEAKER_02]: is more nutritionally available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that might be a possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things to consider would be look up
material that you could farm on scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the environment that proves
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pumpkin seeds, I know cucumber skin has
a large amount of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if there was something that you
could cultivate as opposed to mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that could be cultivated in a method
that wasn't, you know, super expensive and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a big biomass producer,
or maybe it was a waste product,
[SPEAKER_02]: that might be a possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so imagine if you had like a pumpkin
seed phosphorus extract that was put
[SPEAKER_02]: together with some sort of product that
actually worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are the things that I would
think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I look at is most of
the compost test results that we look at
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of phosphorus and a lot of
potassium, depending on the source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so have you looked at local compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any availability of decent
compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you look at any tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think honestly, we're in the
beginning stages of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a few of the soil companies are
starting to get tests done, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the moment, it seems like DIY is
always going to be the best quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably be top dressing any
material that would have phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick Google search would turn up a number
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the idea of working things
through a worm bin, especially when you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have as much available is one of
them, it makes it more effective as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: it's used to the plant, but it also has
the ability to mitigate a lot of potential
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worms can alleviate some of the toxic
properties that may come with some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: mined materials or some of the lower
quality compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if anyone is in an area where all
they have is a compost that they may not
[SPEAKER_02]: be a big fan of, or it's just not as
potent or attractive, or maybe it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: not as good as they think it should be,
you can always run that through a worm bin
[SPEAKER_02]: and make your own superior material
starting with that lower quality starting
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just as a little follow up
question, how long do you think you should
[SPEAKER_01]: ideally leave stuff to mature in a compost
bin for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it almost feels like it's becoming
a bit of a wanking contest where people
[SPEAKER_01]: are like, oh, my one year matured worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I thought three months was
fairly adequate, but it almost seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just creeping up and up as a way of
trying to make yours seem better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's always the same in
any industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always going to be a competitive
spirit to it and there's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: people that want to show off and that's
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, it also depends
on your starting inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're trying to make compost
from woody material and things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: higher lignin and take a long time to
break down, you're going to have to take a
[SPEAKER_02]: longer time to make that compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're doing thermal compost that
you're turning and it's the proper carbon,
[SPEAKER_02]: the nitrogen ratio, in a few weeks,
you have something that's closer to finish
[SPEAKER_02]: than most would expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, either finish it
through worms or let it finish on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shouldn't take very long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three to four months, you can have a good
finished product if you get really good at
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to buy compost that takes a
couple of years to make and is on larger
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the only reasons I think that
is that it seems to be more stable from
[SPEAKER_02]: batch to batch and a little more
homogenous because it takes so long and it
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to settle in at like around 6.4 pH
where the stuff that is made a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: faster with manures or with grasses or
whatever makes that carbon to nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that a lot of times they're a
little bit more volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a wider carbon to nitrogen
ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a little bit more salts,
a little bit more potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so using them at a high, high
percentage is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at home, for instance, if you're
making vermicompost from newspaper
[SPEAKER_02]: recycling and waste mail, it's going to be
nutritionally very different from
[SPEAKER_02]: something like feeding it high phosphorus
amendments and composts and coffee grounds
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff that's really rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just important to consider all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to bring up this
overarching idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have probably done it earlier on,
but there's been, you know, forever
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been arguments over the semantics
of organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: In last episode, we referenced how some
people don't consider gypsum or pumice to
[SPEAKER_01]: technically be organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I've been thinking of is I've
been thinking about this a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I basically think is should the
topic instead of being, is it organic or
[SPEAKER_01]: not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we not instead maybe rephrase it to
be, is it harmful to the micro life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because is that not really the real
factor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if something's not going to be
detrimental to the microbes, does it
[SPEAKER_01]: really matter if it's organic or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really good way to look
at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the other side of that is the
process of how it's extracted,
[SPEAKER_02]: the process of how it's mined,
the availability of the materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sometimes you might find something
that wouldn't be quote unquote organic
[SPEAKER_02]: from maybe a chemistry perspective where
we're trying to find carbon in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But gypsum is certainly organic as far as
approved organic production, as far as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, minerals or something that
plants grow in as well as soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's interesting how convoluted
that conversation gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is as soon as you open up a
policy that says, let's just look if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: good for the microbe life, we could
potentially open ourselves up to using
[SPEAKER_02]: materials that may have some more negative
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess what I mean by that is even
in organics, is it good for the microbe
[SPEAKER_02]: life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it good for the environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it good for us in particular,
our local area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it make financial sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you have to pass it through a
number of different tests, particular to
[SPEAKER_02]: either the farm or the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we're working on scale,
it becomes a lot more important because we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have like luxury budgets for
wasteful products that we may not need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it gets real.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you look at it at an acre
and you may have said, no, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to use any chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you notice that there's a local
product that has phosphorus and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: chicken manure and you can use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it becomes, okay, well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's local.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a waste product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should you visit the farm and see if the
chickens are treated good or is it already
[SPEAKER_02]: a waste and you need to purchase it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to draw the line in the sand
to determine how important it is for you
[SPEAKER_02]: to be supporting businesses, supporting
processes that you would support if you
[SPEAKER_02]: knew all the details of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that line is going to be different for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the base level, of course,
if you have no tail soil, the last thing
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to do is introduce something that
would waste your investment in the
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term use of your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right away it becomes a difference
of, okay, do I want to use all these
[SPEAKER_02]: fast-release nutrients or do I actually
want to have a balanced soil that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to work for me in the long-term?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found different ways to use
different products that help kind of cut
[SPEAKER_02]: corners, if that makes sense, in living
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're sexing seedlings in
smaller containers, you can get away with
[SPEAKER_02]: a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for your main soil for the long-term,
I think it is more than just the microbe
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not as simple as just organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it gets convoluted no matter how
we do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the basics, it just doesn't
matter if it's organic or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It matters especially if you can support
the entire idea behind the product,
[SPEAKER_02]: the producer of the product, if it's good
for your soil, if it's good for your local
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're shipping it, for instance,
like right now, we support the use of Neem
[SPEAKER_02]: and Karanja seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk a little more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the reasons why is we've been
working with a company behind the scenes
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to be locking down a
contract on a locally state-side produced
[SPEAKER_02]: product that I think is going to be really
good for the environment and really good
[SPEAKER_02]: for the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now, though, is importing
something all the way from India worth it,
[SPEAKER_02]: if there's something in my backyard that I
could use?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an individual question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're doing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about to say, don't worry,
we're going to get to Neem gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess what you're getting at is the
devil really is in the details,
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to highlight an example,
this is one I always hear, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool Super Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a product which has Epsom salt in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he advocates if you follow the
recipe correctly, it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel Epsom salt is like a majorly
detrimental thing to the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, do you think it
would turn a product, sorry, would a
[SPEAKER_01]: product no longer be organic if it has a
bit of Epsom salt in it, in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's perfectly fine to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the question more becomes,
why would I be using it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there a purpose?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my garden, I've never found a
purpose to consciously putting it as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as a soil mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why is we use soil testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we get a balance back,
it looks like for the most part,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're very good in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's been cases where we work with
farms, whether it's in potting soil or
[SPEAKER_02]: native soil, where it comes back and it's
low in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next question is, where are we on
sulfur?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we already high or are we low?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're low on sulfur, we're low on
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using magnesium sulfate or Epsom salt is
perfectly fine for organic production and
[SPEAKER_02]: should be used accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen any detriment to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen any reason other than the
fact that the word salt is in the name,
[SPEAKER_02]: not to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at it comparatively,
the fact that gypsum is widely used,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's in our soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's calcium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a chemical's perspective,
magnesium sulfate, if those were just two
[SPEAKER_02]: names, it'd be hard to say one is good and
one is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because I think the word is Epsom
salt, and we think of something we buy at
[SPEAKER_02]: the drug store with a drug label on it for
soaking our feet in, all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_02]: it becomes a convoluted topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not salt, it's not sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even sodium is required in a soil
depending on what the soil test says.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything has its purpose on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that for better or worse,
the whole organic I'm better than you
[SPEAKER_02]: thing has confused the topic of
ingredients a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you referenced earlier amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another kind of trending topic at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your go-to for amino acids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and even more so than that,
I think underlyingly, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't understand what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you've done a bit of research
into it, you maybe understand that not all
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen is amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And amino acids are generally more
valuable than just nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you want to expand on that a little
for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, what are your go-to
sources for them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, with all of this stuff, I am just
somebody who likes to do research,
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who is passionate about this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage you to do your own
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time when I'm conversing
online and we're typing, I'm pasting
[SPEAKER_02]: references in, I'm doing a little bit of
research before I open my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as we go through this, just take it
with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a scientist or an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And amino acids, from what I understand,
have always been important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're at the forefront because we're
finding better ways to produce them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from organics, it is one of those key
boosters that you can apply either
[SPEAKER_02]: foliarly or through the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found is they're building
blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you look at nitrogen,
and if you were to think of it as an
[SPEAKER_02]: organic material like alfalfa and the
nitrogen that they're in as a really long
[SPEAKER_02]: chain, and if you were to break it down,
they would be kind of a polypeptide chain,
[SPEAKER_02]: they call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, those polypeptides
broken down would contain the individual
[SPEAKER_02]: links of the chain, the amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the amino acids are the building
blocks of the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that if we take a step back
and we look at organics and we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about how to use our knowledge and use
biomimicry to the highest level to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, how can we boost this process
without taking over?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we complement and better be soil
and plant, you know, apply better plant
[SPEAKER_02]: husbandry without being in a position
where now it's all synthetic and we're in
[SPEAKER_02]: control?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the key things that we see are folic
acids, amino acids, and a lot of it
[SPEAKER_02]: revolves around lowering the energy
required for the plant to do its job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the plant has to do a job that's
necessary for every part of its
[SPEAKER_02]: production, would it be right to
supplement that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would it be helpful to give the plant
more of it so that it doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce it itself so that it can then
continue its job at a more efficient pace?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I ask these questions,
I start to think about human nutrition
[SPEAKER_02]: because I oftentimes compare it to myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think of the stomach as a cation
exchange and the colon and that whole
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was going for a bodybuilding contest
or if I wanted to be at an Olympic athlete
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever it was, and I'm trying to be
in peak optimal condition like we want out
[SPEAKER_02]: of our plants, not just a general run of
the mill organic plant, but one that is at
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of its game with every ability to
produce possible according to its own
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much like a human, it's not like you're
gonna grow taller because you're taking a
[SPEAKER_02]: supplement, but you might be healthier and
better able to perform your functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it would be like an athlete
eating all the square meals and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at a certain point, it takes so much
time out of their day to prepare those
[SPEAKER_02]: meals, to chew them and to digest them
alongside with all the work they have to
[SPEAKER_02]: do to maintain their optimal results.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense that they would blend stuff
in a smoothie and that is micronization.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do that all the time with organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that they're faster available
when we micronize things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next thing we look at is
amino acids as part of the profile for
[SPEAKER_02]: recovery and for building those muscles
and for performing at a higher level
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of just looking at protein as
protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the McDonald's cheeseburger versus a
very selective grass-fed protein product
[SPEAKER_02]: or premium vegetable or whatever you get
your protein from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you think of it that way,
of course it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter who you are, you could always be
improved upon with a couple of supplements
[SPEAKER_02]: that are natural and giving you that peak
optimal potential for either keeping your
[SPEAKER_02]: energy up or making sure that you can
perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go back to plants and it's like,
okay, we can do water only.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can build a soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me that is eating the three square
meals or the four meals a day with the
[SPEAKER_02]: right balance of vegetables, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we look at the supplements as the
next level that we can start to apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did the basics in the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows you'd make a good living
soil, good compost, water only as long as
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a lot of soil and a mulch layer
and worms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna have very good results,
but aminos are kind of that next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been playing with a product
called Thriven and it's a freeze-dried
[SPEAKER_02]: fish hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't require the phosphoric
acid or the liquid that comes along with
[SPEAKER_02]: the liquid fish products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also played with some soy
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys have available out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be called an amino acid product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, I think someone was using like
the coconut pulp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people making a lot of fish
hydroxylates, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, hydroxylates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get all the words wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of DIY stuff at the moment,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the amino acid products and we
started with one called Pure Protein Dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the story goes that RootWise and some
of the other big tree outdoor growers he
[SPEAKER_02]: turned me on to, he mentioned that a lot
of them were using these amino acid
[SPEAKER_02]: products to grow bigger than 10 pound
plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that it became a big thing where
people would foliar spray amino acids a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of times a week or more,
even deep into flower on these outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: crops and have superior results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wouldn't get the fading of the
leaves so early.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't get all these problems that
would happen when you're really trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow a 10 pound plus plant, which will
highlight a lot of your weaknesses much
[SPEAKER_02]: faster than when you're growing a small
plant and on a short season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that got my interest because now I
know, okay, the pros, the people that I
[SPEAKER_02]: look up to, a lot of times they're not
talking about a lot of the processes
[SPEAKER_02]: because they'll get judged from every
angle for maybe foliar spraying something
[SPEAKER_02]: in flower or maybe using a product that is
not the typical permaculture style.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started using the Pure Protein
Dry and we had really incredible results.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really sped up the vegetative process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allowed us to take advantage of the
hormonal change that happens when you go
[SPEAKER_02]: into flower and leverage some very
available nitrogen that's not the same
[SPEAKER_02]: type that normally causes burn and
problems and foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can use a small amount of it
all the way through flower or at least up
[SPEAKER_02]: near the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll allow you to leverage the
flowering components even better as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: the building blocks of building those
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right away we knew, okay,
amino acids are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so from Pure Protein Dry, we found
there was actually some extra products
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was zinc and there was iron and
there was some bacterias and we just
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't interested in all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also started getting a mixture of
different packages showing up when we
[SPEAKER_02]: ordered the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so behind the scenes, we talked to a
few growers that knew the real story and
[SPEAKER_02]: found out that the interceptor had a
falling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beyond all of that drama, the product
Thrive N is supposedly the leader in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and they're taking their time to
get all the labels right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the product in our store now and
it is a singular ingredient and it is the
[SPEAKER_02]: more pure form of aminos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now I'm encouraging others to
play with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share their feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you don't have access to that
product, I'd encourage you to research and
[SPEAKER_02]: find something that may be applicable
because I've never been a big foliar spray
[SPEAKER_02]: guy, but these amino acids are making a
big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that besides that,
also just using them as part of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of weeks during stretch and flower,
it might make a big difference to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you've got a huge bed of soil,
it's been there for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got worms in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got tons of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think you're always going to be
okay with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we mentioned, the Olympic athlete
compared to the average person,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of times a couple of supplements
might make that 1% difference that make
[SPEAKER_02]: that gold medal difference versus someone
who's at home not achieving the same
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm open to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think amino acids is really one of
the paramount organic tools, just like
[SPEAKER_02]: fulvics and a few other things that are
worth the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is around here,
when you're looking at the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the problems with our clay soil
leads a lot of people to getting a fish
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer to organically farm on scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they recommend about, I think it's 10
to 15 gallons per acre for a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: production crop like corn or tomatoes or
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we look at the dry amino
acids, because they are, as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: a more available form of nitrogen,
a smaller, more micronized, more available
[SPEAKER_02]: absorbable form, you can now use a pound
per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that replaces about five to seven
gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you wanted to go up to that 15
gallon mark, you would only use maybe two
[SPEAKER_02]: to three pounds at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that dramatically lowers the shipping
cost of the material to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm all about those leverage
points.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're at a farm that has no nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump tens of thousands of pounds of
compost out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to go till in a typical
nitrogen fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that having aminos is a
good advantage in that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if we use your analogy of the
athletes or the Olympic athletes and
[SPEAKER_01]: supplements, let's jump from supplements
to steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that both you and myself are
playing around with the triacontinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to possibly be a game
changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you played around with it yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you did a post about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played around with it, but I will
say, no, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean by that is I'm guessing if I'm
playing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just doing natural processes,
sprouting alfalfa seeds, which I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think have any in there, and playing with
alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that alfalfa compost is
probably a good way to get some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about the waxy
substance, the triacontinol that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And alfalfa makes a very good compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a good carbon and nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some very documented processes on
making it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that might be something
that I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the actual chemical product,
you can just go buy an extract of
[SPEAKER_02]: triacontinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not played with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would really, really like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I haven't because it's not
something that I really want to focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: carrying those particular types of
products that are a little bit less
[SPEAKER_02]: documented, a little bit more out there
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure when someone goes to
build a soil, we've at least put it
[SPEAKER_02]: through its paces and we know there's some
value there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not something I've really
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know like you though, that a lot of
growers have, and there's a couple pieces
[SPEAKER_02]: of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that a little goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can definitely be abused and cause
some weird problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, I'm hearing that
like you, there is some huge potential
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would encourage everyone to do
their own research and see what they can
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for right now, I don't have any at my
house and I have never even looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: buying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've played around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of a nightmare to be
honest, because the molecule itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just a big suspicion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it an extract of a plant or is it like
a chemical thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're probably both available,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe this one's just straight
chemically derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is because it is such a
waxy molecule in nature, it's like 98%
[SPEAKER_01]: surfactant, 2% tricantanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you said, again, a little goes
a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's like one mil of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix into like 50 litres or something
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the craziest dilution I've ever seen
basically for an organic product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for a product that's not blatantly
salt, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times you'll find that and for
instance, we carry a yucca product that is
[SPEAKER_02]: for the saponin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one we carry is 100% yucca.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a molasses and a certain
percentage is a saponin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you pour it, it's like molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that on the market,
when someone's making a product,
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be a detracting factor for the
home user because it's sloppy,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why don't we just dilute it down to
about 4%, put it in water, and now it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really easy to pour and charge a thousand
times the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's always this effect where
people can sell more if it's easier to
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll notice the newer products that
are really out there like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: they haven't been really formulated into
an easy to use, really expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's typically these crazy dilution rates,
these really small amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't make sense on scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once we figure out how to use it in
actual dosages, I'd imagine there'll be a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of products out there that'll contain
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like right now when people are
talking about mammoth pee, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that there's been a discussion on
is, is that really just a trichontinol
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're getting around saying because
they're saying they're fermenting the
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa as part of the extract of the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whether it's politics or whether
it's a label, a lot of times you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: away with the unknown product piggybacking
on the one that you can say is the
[SPEAKER_02]: important thing to be on the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have no knowledge of that about
mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could care less.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in playing with that, and you can talk
to anybody that has and compared it to
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe mammoth pee, or had issues with it,
I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm the only one I know who's played
around with the trichontinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's mostly my American buds who
have played around with the mammoth pee
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's so expensive to get over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the normal prices plus an arm
and a leg for shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to talk about that more later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll get some and go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do a few different test
rounds at the Build A Soil store.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that gets
overwhelming is the amount of ideas we
[SPEAKER_02]: have for side by sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to have a college size or a
medical sized facility that just had
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing but well documented side by sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can run tests like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fortunately with the laws,
it's not exactly like barley where we can
[SPEAKER_02]: just have a greenhouse everywhere testing
all the varieties for the next year's
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's jump on to a topic that's
probably going to make a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: real butt hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Omri registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that I actually just cannot
stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a huge pet peeve because as far
as all the research points to that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: done, a product with Omri registration is
more likely to not be organic than to be
[SPEAKER_01]: organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to know your opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got a great photo on my
Instagram of a big bag of calcium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the bluest looking salt you've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got that big old Omri
registration on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you deal with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Conundrum, shall we say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at a certain level, if you know what
Omri means, you can at least use it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: filter for getting you a certain
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you hit the nail on the head when you
said the word register.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the Organic Materials Review
Institute reviews products, puts them on a
[SPEAKER_02]: list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really the proper terminology would be
listed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's interesting because all they do
is they charge money to put you on a list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we all know, when there's money
being exchanged to be on a list,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of times there's ways to get that
done where the product may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily organic, but it's approved for
organic production under one scenario or
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little misleading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel that it probably started out
with the right intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you follow and I talked to
Clackamas Coutts about the origins of some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the processes and how Oregon TILF used
to be called TILF and it was a group of a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of different states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually they got big enough
and broke off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the California Organic
Farmers, and you have the Oregon TILF,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have all these different
institutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have Omri that comes in and
says, okay, well, we've seen all these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as long as it meets all of these
different ones, we'll put you on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're Oregon TILF, they might
have a Me Too, where they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, you passed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure you could be Omri.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just send us your information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea is to communicate about
the actual products and make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's acceptable and transparent
for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really like the idea, but it starts
to convolute things because as soon as you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't trust it, now you have this
misleading badge out there that becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a marketing ploy and a dollar
generating machine than actual creating
[SPEAKER_02]: transparency for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always look for Oregon TILF if I
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then second to that, I'm not so
concerned with certifications if I can
[SPEAKER_02]: meet the producer or if I can get a better
understanding of how it's created.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times the barrier to these
expensive organic protocols is that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of smaller producers that have
higher quality products unable to compete
[SPEAKER_02]: by putting these labels on there,
which is a good and a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the smaller producers also will
do things that aren't acceptable on large
[SPEAKER_02]: scale as far as cleanliness or packing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're experiencing a lot of this as
we grow as a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never sought to put NPK labels or to
put Omri listing or to put green,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean, or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely of no value to us because
if our products aren't good enough
[SPEAKER_02]: already, going out and buying some label
to put on it to me doesn't make it any
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just trying to communicate that
faster to the customer on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we rely on a more direct conversation
with our customer and with our material
[SPEAKER_02]: producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does Omri, is it in Australia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they also list a lot of the products
out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you guys have that would be
more like Oregon Tilth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, you caught me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should know the answer to who's like the
good body to refer to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's definitely Omri out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know at all what's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm wondering if it's similar out
here that it's more of like a political
[SPEAKER_02]: thing than it is an actual something you
can make a purchase decision off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if it says Oregon Tilth,
I'm confident buying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it says Omri, I'm going to do more
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's the difference for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm pretty lucky after our last
chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I messaged Steve Solomon and he's been
kind enough to be in correspondence with
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I've ever got a question,
I can usually run it by him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he's a goldmine of
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really happy to hear you're talking to
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't speak with him often.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only been a couple of times,
but he was always so forthcoming with
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he seems so passionate that I felt
like he too had hit it off well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: After reading his book, The Intelligent
Gardener, upon your recommendation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and everyone else should have read it by
now, it's been a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely brought up the idea of,
and you even very briefly touched on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: how there's this community of people out
there who think that it's very possible
[SPEAKER_01]: that like the overall increase in disease
and cancer and things like that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: due to a decrease in the nutrient density
within our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kind of very much on board with
that, or you've maybe changed your mind a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit since then?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that it is definitely related to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are what we eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at a historical number.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at countries that are doing better
and start eating more meat and start
[SPEAKER_02]: eating products that are not as nutrient
dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rate of disease goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's directly correlated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel that anyone that doesn't see
that is just lying to themselves because
[SPEAKER_02]: they have something they're more
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you start growing plants and
you see a garden and see how quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies can affect it, it reflects
back on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it makes you someone more
aware of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: To convolute that more, a lot of times we
see things there's a quote out there like
[SPEAKER_02]: every disease can be related to a mineral
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you look it up, that quote's
actually completely misquoted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really exist by the scientists
it's quoted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like people can go a little
bit overboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that turns into products like
Shilajit and mineral products that may or
[SPEAKER_02]: may not be necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, if you're getting
food that's made from hydroponic bottles,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that there's going to be a
decline in health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we start looking at calcium and
other things that are important to our
[SPEAKER_02]: body and we look at the soil that these
products are grown in, we see a direct
[SPEAKER_02]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's so obvious to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things that almost
upsets me when you hear that people don't
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that or they think that new
technology is just always the answer and
[SPEAKER_02]: that farming organically is not
sustainable can feed the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like a lot of the problems are
more to do with the fact that we've all
[SPEAKER_02]: just accepted that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly over the last five years there's
been a huge movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it feels that way to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm just involved in it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it the same over there or is there
kind of a division where people just
[SPEAKER_02]: either don't agree with it at all or it's
just obvious?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's not a lot of middle
ground there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that it'd be a much smaller
percentage of people who are aware of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I was almost a bit in the
twilight zone when I was in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_01]: almost everyone was really concerned about
the use of glyphosate and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, man, you'd never get this
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are not really that worried about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that it's not to be worried
about, but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just stay accepted as you put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the point it brings to my mind
is, do you think it's almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility then if you grow organic to
try to just grow some regular stuff as
[SPEAKER_01]: well seeing as you got all the skills and
probably all the gear to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that it's always been that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for me, I grew up in a cul-de-sac
and then when I moved to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: having land and all of this was a little
bit new to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opportunity was a little bit more
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that people that don't have that
land but now know how to use a container,
[SPEAKER_02]: they go through the same process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canvas to me was a gateway to a better
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It taught me how to garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized that you didn't really need a
green thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just this perpetuated model of,
hey, if you want to garden, it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're never really going to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go get a start from Home Depot and
it's never really going to grow because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to buy potting soil that
doesn't really have anything in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be frustrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're never going to get any food and
then you're going to realize you spent
[SPEAKER_02]: $300 on four tomatoes and it would have
been just better to go to the grocery
[SPEAKER_02]: store.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you start producing really good
yields of your own cannabis, you start to
[SPEAKER_02]: realize, hey man, maybe I could do pretty
good over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I don't need 100% of my food from
the garden, it's on my heart to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love it if I had that much time to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like one of the challenges that we
face today is that we have the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: spend a lot more of our day doing other
things to produce an income that allows us
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts to happen though.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden when you have lettuce and
more produce and more things that taste a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot better and last longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They end up working their way into more of
your meals and your health will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything in your life will change when
you start growing organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's definitely different from
someone who is farming in the typical
[SPEAKER_02]: methodology.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, when I started growing food,
because of this, I looked at all the NPK
[SPEAKER_02]: bottles that I had and I thought,
when do I flush my tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this safe to eat?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does this work?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those questions started to get
other questions that put me down that
[SPEAKER_02]: rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I doing this with my cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we jump back to a point you mentioned
earlier, this is another one which grinds
[SPEAKER_01]: my gears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shilajit Shills.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only really one out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know who it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to give him any credibility
saying his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get a ruling on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shilajit is not going to cure your cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Viagra.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not your replacement for your
antidepressant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one of the challenges when
we're working with nutritional information
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it can be skewed so many different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highlighted on the conversation of
micronutrient and the quote of every
[SPEAKER_02]: disease being related to some
micronutrient deficiency and then
[SPEAKER_02]: catalyzing that out there saying this
product XYZ has every micronutrient and
[SPEAKER_02]: look it, they're all in really low levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would encourage you to do your own
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not using any Shilajit products and
I'm not saying that they're bad or that
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't have a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't jump on the bandwagon
because I find that when I do jump on
[SPEAKER_02]: bandwagons, I end up running it at least
for my customer base.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try and slow down a little bit,
do our research and if things hold up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the test of time and we start to see
reason and our research points to a
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose, then we want to test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we've always been a
believer of is that if we're after fulvic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid, we should get fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we learned when
looking for fulvic acids from Dr. Faust is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's a golden liquid that is
completely free of any of the colloidal
[SPEAKER_02]: minerals or the fulvic minerals.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are after minerals, as a human,
I feel like eating plants is the way we're
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to get our minerals, not by
eating mined material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the reason why is there is a ton
of research that shows that we don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: much about the periodic table of elements
and the slow buildup in our body of even
[SPEAKER_02]: trace amounts of a lot of that periodic
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would feel more comfortable eating kelp
because of how long we've eaten it for and
[SPEAKER_02]: the trace minerals that are available
there and the alginic acid and other
[SPEAKER_02]: materials that come with it to make it
safe for us to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at a product like Shilajit,
if I want the fulvic, when it is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely open to chelate, it has
beneficial properties and you can add it
[SPEAKER_02]: to whatever you'd like to chelate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we, without going too far in the word
chelate, just think of that as make a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more available because fulvic
can, it has this ability of being so
[SPEAKER_02]: molecularly lightweight that it can carry
across into the plant nutrients at an
[SPEAKER_02]: alarming rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with normal fulvic acid, if we're
using large amounts of alumina silicate
[SPEAKER_02]: rock dust and the fulvic acid is releasing
that alumina because it's so good at its
[SPEAKER_02]: job, is that a problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're using Shilajit and it already has
all these minerals in it, are any of those
[SPEAKER_02]: at alarmingly high rates or if they're
not, would the slow use add up over time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we have lack of knowledge,
I just tend to stay away from and go to
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's been around for a longer
period of time when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture and when it comes to efficacy
versus the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, Faust was working with Dr.
Sen of the author of the, I forget the
[SPEAKER_02]: name of the book, but the Seaweed Book.
[SPEAKER_02]: They extracted fulvic and humics from
seaweed, but it just wasn't cost effective
[SPEAKER_02]: for agriculture and so I don't think that
it's going to take off for any reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at Shilajit, it comes with
the minerals and so the red flag goes off
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Faust pointed in my head, if you're
going to be after humic and fulvics,
[SPEAKER_02]: humic are the molecular weight that are,
it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a black, darker product, more like
the looks of some of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes with all the mineral where the
fulvic is like the hash, the extract
[SPEAKER_02]: without any of that stuff and so if you're
looking for fulvic, the completely open is
[SPEAKER_02]: not only more cost effective, but it's
going to do its job on what you intend and
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're looking for a micronutrient,
I encourage you to do a soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hit the micronutrient on the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a micronutrient issue in your
body where you feel it's a problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can talk to a doctor and we can figure
out exactly what that is because some
[SPEAKER_02]: people need iron and some people are high
on iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think that blanket approach is
not necessarily the best way to
[SPEAKER_02]: communicate these processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect answer, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: To just loop back on what you mentioned,
bandwagoning, you don't like to get on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed you didn't get on the Neem Gate
bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, Shilajit did, which is all the
more hilarious in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was such an interesting one to me,
this whole Neem controversy thing because
[SPEAKER_01]: in my mind, it was so stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone has ever top dressed with just a
handful of Neem within a day or two,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have seen it's just totally
engulfed in fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea that Neem just totally retards
fungal bacterial colony numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the claim being made
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought it was ridiculous and it
was so obvious that Neem was a positive
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to add to your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you feel when you first saw it?
[SPEAKER_01]: More importantly, how did you feel when a
few people kind of started to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were believing in what not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it just like the world's gone mad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I felt like the sky was falling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really funny to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to tell you, no matter what it
is, I treat it seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get this cognitive
dissonance, I guess, or whatever you call
[SPEAKER_02]: it, where I just, like you said,
oh, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: My firmly held beliefs are superior and
correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm always open to challenge those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just run them through a standard
series of questions, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I compare them to research and
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when someone says that it's not
going to work because it kills fungus and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to cause a detriment,
first I take a step back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any evidence that a bacterial or
a fungally dominated soil is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: any different in production?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we can look at the compost all day
long, but I look at the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And growers that I know are comparing
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not comparing the fungal
domination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that being said, we work with a number
of greenhouses on large scale that are
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in documenting every subsect of
information so that they can compare
[SPEAKER_02]: against crop to crop to crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you keep that in mind,
you find out that most of the data is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have a problem, you can start
to compare data run to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're finding that our growers
using our soils with neem cake mixed in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and top dresses of neem and garamja
and using neem oils, they're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: tested at a very same facility,
Earth Fort, that does a lot of the testing
[SPEAKER_02]: through the Ingham camp for the bacterial
and fungal domination or the balance
[SPEAKER_02]: there, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're doing phenomenally well as far
as would be reviewed in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would appear as if they wouldn't be
using neem cake if that was the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, it was just immediately,
I already knew we already had the testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: we already had the documentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this was a non-issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I also know is that for every one
of my customers that uses products
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly and uses them with balance and
with maturity, I feel like there is
[SPEAKER_02]: another couple of customers that will use
them maybe to learn how they work and
[SPEAKER_02]: where the limits are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll use them every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll top dress with massive amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will double the results because if
some is good and more is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they're right, sometimes
they're wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's possible in this
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that led to some of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem with this one is it was so
ridiculous to me, I didn't follow most of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon as I figured out that it didn't pass
my test as far as being really something I
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to pay attention to, I pretty much
disconnected at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like everyone's entitled to
their own opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can share whatever information they
feel is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I always ask if there's some
reason for someone to lie or some reason
[SPEAKER_02]: to manipulate the data for the financial
gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people mentioned that I didn't do
any research there to see if that's a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just not even an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem cake is not something that I would
worry about at all, especially when used
[SPEAKER_02]: according to our recommended data
messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an interesting point I picked up,
by the way, thanks for pointing out my
[SPEAKER_01]: logical fallacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I noticed was a lot of the
comments I read surrounding the topic was
[SPEAKER_01]: they would say, oh, this is just like
Ingen's teachings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taken to the nth degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that is the truth or that was
a misinterpretation in itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think maybe what they're alluding to
is that she believes, maybe not
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically that Neem retards fungal
dominance, but that I think less fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the numbers, I'm not
somebody who follows that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not of huge importance for me
to memorize the balance of bacteria count
[SPEAKER_02]: versus fungal count that we're looking for
in all of these reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not like you want to fungally
dominate in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a balance that's supposed to be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I mentioned, we're seeing really
good balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a number of our customers are using
Neem cakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just became a non-issue to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do feel that without me getting
really deep into researching Neem cake,
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately it was brought to my
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a thought that I had that this
was taking the Ingham thing to that nth
[SPEAKER_02]: degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I say that is in the past,
in working with Tim Wilson, my crew of
[SPEAKER_02]: men, and he's been really helpful in my
business and helpful in answering
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening questions without really any
financial motivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the products he offered are so poorly
thought out as far as how much profit
[SPEAKER_02]: would be there for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really all about the gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike Ingham, who I have respect for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not been to her classes to say that
they're bad or anything, but she has a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more of a financial motivation
to the information being regarded as
[SPEAKER_02]: absolute truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I talk to Coot, and he
mentions that Tad over at Keep It Simple,
[SPEAKER_02]: who I think already did a podcast on this
topic, had studies going against that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that his father, Leon, was actually
mentioned in the Ingham intro as really as
[SPEAKER_02]: the creator or the inventor, the first
person to use compost tea in the process
[SPEAKER_02]: that we discussed today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are fully of the agreement that
there is a benefit to using meme cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It further complements the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that if I were to ask Tim
Wilson, if I were to ask Tad, if I were to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask anybody that's been involved in this
whole process, a lot of times there's been
[SPEAKER_02]: a differing viewpoint in the exact
opposite of what the Elaine Ingham camp
[SPEAKER_02]: says.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's so funny is both of these processes
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use meme cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do aerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we're still seeing
gardeners produce killer results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as with anything in life, does the
person you're following have the results
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I can't find is people that are
having crazy high fungal dominance getting
[SPEAKER_02]: amazed in crops and showing me that
they're superior than the other methods of
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterial dominated soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't feel like it's a metric
that's really worth investing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: money into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that quality compost will create a
quality result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever balance that fungal bacterial is,
is relevant to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I took a look into that
myself and I think Tad and his dad were
[SPEAKER_01]: also some of the first people to take like
really high quality photos of like
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopic photos of the fungal tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd like actually be able to see the
bacteria and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're definitely some dudes to listen
to on the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did like is you mentioned Coot
there and I have seen recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you guys have released your
official Coot's line where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a little bit of that's going towards
Coot's when someone buys it, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It raised this idea in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think Coot's like as a recipe,
so to speak, is it just a recipe or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: something he can kind of claim ownership
over in a sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was thinking you could just try
to build a soil, so to speak, and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: built it to what you think is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then someone comes along and they're
like, oh yeah, that's like basically
[SPEAKER_01]: Coot's mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, it's just kind of,
it seems to me like it's almost just a
[SPEAKER_01]: name for a rough amount of amendments in a
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a cake recipe,
you know, it's like, and so it raised this
[SPEAKER_01]: idea in my mind of like, yeah,
do you think it's like a name recognition
[SPEAKER_01]: thing or an association thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a weird topic, you know,
like should Coot get compensated if
[SPEAKER_01]: someone uses the name Coot's mix or is it
just in kind of the general domain at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that he would say that he doesn't
take any right to any of that stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's totally in the general domain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's regurgitating complete information
that was taken from many other sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so build a soil, as much as we could
have a build a soil recipe, it wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is it's just a
culmination of ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's so great about this is like
Coot, he turned me on to the no need bread
[SPEAKER_02]: making process.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't looked into it,
go on YouTube, type in no need bread,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's this guy, Artisan Bread with
Stev or Steve, S-T-E-V on there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the regular recipe is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little bit of flour,
a little bit of salt, water, yeast,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's key is using time, 24 hour or 12
hour, eight hour, you know, at least an
[SPEAKER_02]: overnight type of fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes one of the best breads I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just bread though, is it Steve's
bread?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but that term, basically the no need
bread now points to him because he is the
[SPEAKER_02]: one that has perpetuated sharing that
information with everyone so they can
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Coot took the basic, you know,
Solomon three-way lime mix from Steve
[SPEAKER_02]: Solomon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned him with the dolomite and the
gypsum and the oyster shell or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: the recipe was, and he put his own spin on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took the recommended amounts of
certain dry amendments and played with
[SPEAKER_02]: them over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you followed Lumpher Dogs and
Clackamas Coot over the years in the
[SPEAKER_02]: forums, the Coot's mix changed over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Coot's fix it mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was these different recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Build A Soil started, we tried a
number of different soil recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found is that the simpler recipe
with the best compost always out produced
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as from a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could certainly add to it what it
needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you started with an unbalanced soil
that just had the whole kitchen sink
[SPEAKER_02]: thrown in, it didn't make for a better
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess what Coot taught us was use
critical thinking when finding premium
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients that aren't wasteful.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, you cannot amend your
way to a good soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our Coot's mix is great, but it is just
amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the best compost and the
amendments to marry this whole process
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly give him credit for the Coot
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why we're actually paying
him a percentage is we feel like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to help us sell more in a sense that
we want to, instead of everyone call
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever out there is a Coot's mix,
we want the Coot's mix to be exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: we discussed, what he helped us procure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is if you mix some
crappy kelp from some random ocean,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you take some seed meal, and you take
some run of the mill rock dust,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you call it a Coot's mix, I don't
think it's due honor to the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we wanted to make sure
that it's separated and highlighted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also really great that we can pass on
some financial compensation to him,
[SPEAKER_02]: mainly because he helps us behind the
scenes so much still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exercising these ideas, running through
processes, looking at different composts,
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to him several times a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just feel like he gives so much
without ever asking that if this really
[SPEAKER_02]: does work and it can provide an income
through him through retirement,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would feel like Build a Soil did
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not the only ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other people that I think are
trying to find ways to support Coot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think anybody should support who
brought them to the party and who
[SPEAKER_02]: supported them when they didn't have
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Coot, that name and that association
has done really well for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think partially because he's always been
a part of my life as far as gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was authentic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't something we were just trying to
brand off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next thing was the next
evolution and then moving away from
[SPEAKER_02]: glacial rock dust towards basalt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like Coot's mix is a little bit
specific as far as where it's at,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it'll probably be evolving even
forward in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the interesting posts I came
across last night, which I think some
[SPEAKER_01]: people might be a little upset about in
Australia because it's insect grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things where people are
really excited about it, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: widely available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few companies who are starting
to produce some and a few people are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting their hands on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I found your post.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, less than 1% chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just a complete waste of time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, but I think that any biologically
natural waste product has some benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The challenge is I feel like if you get a
salesperson and a scientist together and
[SPEAKER_02]: you just start researching the chemical
makeup of any product, you can come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with some benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I was a kid, I remember
those cereal commercials that would say
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll take 12 bowls of this cereal to
equal one of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, yeah, for iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not exactly an apples to
apples comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just important, I think,
to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, outside of insect frost,
then what is a source to get some actual
[SPEAKER_01]: existent chitin from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a product that is one of the
first documentable guaranteed chitin
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're interested in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But crustacean meal has chitin in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The manufacturer of the chitin product we
use makes it from a consortium of ground
[SPEAKER_02]: up insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what that's interesting is that
normally we would buy the waste product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have an insect farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell insects to pet companies and
people that use insects for all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the waste is considered a frass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That frass is now sold as a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the frass is more about the waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about the production,
but the insects are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this product called OptiVeg that we
carry is an 8.1%, I believe, is the number
[SPEAKER_02]: of chitin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because they actually micronize
the insects, not the waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the waste has such a low amount of
actual chitin in it is because the chitin
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from the insect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a little bit of dead
material along with the waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that determines the variable amount of
chitin in the insect frass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's still a waste product,
like a guano or like a chicken manure or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's typically that the input
material, whatever that's feeding these
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs, was going to be micronized and made
slightly more bioavailable by working it
[SPEAKER_02]: through a bug.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, again, is this theme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of taking raw minerals or raw
materials, we feed them either through
[SPEAKER_02]: worm bins, through animals, through bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get a more bioavailable,
closer to a plant form of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is faster to work through the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: So insect frass has total viability.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, one of the places we're looking
at right now is we found a place in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty far away, but the size of
their facility and their ability to create
[SPEAKER_02]: a product from a waste makes it still
lower cost than what we can find locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the frass they produce is from soldier
flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually recycle a ton of organic
waste, just tons of produce and bad
[SPEAKER_02]: lettuce and vegetables and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets worked by these soldier flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soldier fly larva are very unfamiliar with
the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns it into a frass.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got our first sample, and we're
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that instead of just paying a
top dollar for a new bandwagon-type
[SPEAKER_02]: product, I think that it'd be more
important if we're after chiton,
[SPEAKER_02]: get a chiton product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we just want a kind of a vegan waste
product, because these insects are feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: on vegetables instead of animal material,
it probably has some value.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's super expensive, it would be
better if it was recycling a waste
[SPEAKER_02]: locally, and you can get it at a
cost-effective price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we didn't add frass to any of our
new recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kept as kind of a side product that
we use in recommendation to get an
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I mean by that is when you're top
dressing, you're putting worms in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting the ecosystem going,
to me it would make sense to put some dead
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs and some insect waste and all of
these things that might build the
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem without actually introducing
live bugs and problems for our type of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned Canada just there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to look to expand to
possibly worldwide shipping now that you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys have got Canada sorted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've had a few questions from
people who would consider getting some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff even here in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're actually working on that right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our logistics team.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growing as a company, and so that
allows us to focus on projects that would
[SPEAKER_02]: have taken too much time away from the day
to day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as we go through each winter,
which is slightly slower than the chaos of
[SPEAKER_02]: the springtime, it allows us to grow and
expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're looking at worldwide
shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how soon it will become
available, and it'll be on key products
[SPEAKER_02]: that make sense, that are lightweight,
that may have some viability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to be careful not to just start
shipping stuff all over the world for no
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start working as a company,
and someone calls you and says,
[SPEAKER_02]: look it, I just want to play with this
Kytan product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no way to get it locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's ever going to make it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without waiting 10 years for someone to do
it, can you just ship me a small amount so
[SPEAKER_02]: I can satisfy my curiosity?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, I'd love to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's tariff codes, and there's
import fees and taxes, and there's all
[SPEAKER_02]: these hoops to jump through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting very close.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been able to ship to Canada recently
and very accurately predict the fees and
[SPEAKER_02]: make a good experience for our customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we're more confident that we're not
going to just cause customer service
[SPEAKER_02]: nightmares, we're going to start rolling
that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to look at Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you and I both know, the shipping costs
are just outrageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that for the hobbyists and for
the enthusiasts, a couple of products,
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually might, it might work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's products in other
countries that I'd love to play with and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe as a cool gift idea even,
and maybe not as like a sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as like an overarching question,
because this one, you could probably
[SPEAKER_01]: answer it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel as though we're slowly moving
towards like, how should we say,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a homogenized growing style that will
be eventually quite specific for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in that, you know, at the moment it feels
like people are incorporating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bits of KNF, you know,
Coutts recipe, a whole bunch of other
[SPEAKER_01]: little supplements here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think after a long enough period of
time, we might have our own kind of grow
[SPEAKER_01]: style, you know, like the Cannotill type
thing, you know, just some word like that
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's, yeah, it's just, you know,
borrowing principles from a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: other things to the point where it's
almost its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the reason why I don't think that
that's necessarily gonna be coined is that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've stolen from so many other processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like anybody at the forefront of
production, like any world record pumpkin
[SPEAKER_02]: grower, world record tomato grower,
somebody who's into gardening,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've all come to the same answers taking
a different path and same with cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the difference is the amount of
time and money we're willing to invest in
[SPEAKER_02]: this crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where it may become, where it may
become coined is when we look at
[SPEAKER_02]: production, if we were gonna do acreage
production and you were to call,
[SPEAKER_02]: for instance, like a local co-op or a
local farmer's outfit that would give you
[SPEAKER_02]: pricing on fertilizer for your corn or
whatever's grown traditionally in your
[SPEAKER_02]: area, I'd imagine we'll have a line drawn
in the sand where they say, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: are you growing, you know, cannabis style
or are you growing, you know, regular
[SPEAKER_02]: style?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the difference there would be,
you know, the ability to spend thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars an acre versus 50 bucks an acre
because of the actual end use of the
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like anytime you have a really
high cash crop, you're gonna see similar
[SPEAKER_02]: practices where we're just trying to
maximize the yield and the quality because
[SPEAKER_02]: those would be important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, that's permaculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think we're gonna have to
coin something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I almost figure it'll probably just
be continually evolving anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that I have noticed though,
which I'm not sure whether it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: works, I wanted to run it by you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people using like various
dehydrating machines and using vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: waste, most notably banana skins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they'll have like,
you know, these really dehydrated banana
[SPEAKER_01]: skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They then grind it up, mix it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that's so simple and so
brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But does it actually work?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, you know, considered doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it fits one of the processes that
we talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I like to think of things in groups
and then it's easier to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk, you know, the fulvic acid over
here, aminos over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all things that lower energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the steps that we talked about was
micronization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take products that are nutrient
dense, you micronize them and they're more
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, in a no-till situation,
all of those micronized products are not
[SPEAKER_02]: available to the plant until they're
processed through the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: So similarly that we mix alfalfa meal,
the fact that we mix in neem seed meal,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of those are just more affordable
waste products that make sense to use as a
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody says you can't do the same thing
with freeze-dried expensive high-end
[SPEAKER_02]: products or waste products of your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the difference would be I'd
probably use some of those amendments more
[SPEAKER_02]: like a worm food in my mulch layer so they
could then make them available to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always find myself getting
infatuated with wanting to learn more
[SPEAKER_02]: about how to be in control and give them
nutrients when they need it and really
[SPEAKER_02]: treat the plants really well through that
soil by feeding it the best stuff on
[SPEAKER_02]: earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever that may be, purple barley and
banana peel freeze-dried and all this and
[SPEAKER_02]: Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like that's just because we all
love this end result.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to continue to be working towards
them and doing something for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if necessarily the plant
cares that it's banana peels or if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: self-alfa meal or if it's some other
source of that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at a certain point, we're getting away
from the fact that keeping above that
[SPEAKER_02]: limiting factor, keeping the soil aerated,
keeping an ability to deliver nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping everything watered properly,
the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a certain point, all these things are
much more important than the exact source
[SPEAKER_02]: of the NPK, the micronutrients and all
those things that will be delivered to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we had that discussion
about is it better that it's organic or is
[SPEAKER_02]: it more important that it doesn't hurt the
earth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day,
it gets broken down through the soil food
[SPEAKER_02]: web into basically a chemical form of
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference is that delivery method
being carbon for organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that cannabis being a C4
plant, it just makes so much sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: organics is the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, what do you think
is the big difference between worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings and say like a high quality
compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they equal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I guess we've been alluding to the idea
that the castings is going to be your best
[SPEAKER_01]: bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what makes it better ultimately?
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people out there who maybe don't
have a good bulk supplier, do you think it
[SPEAKER_01]: still justifies the cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because often it can be a fair bit more
expensive than just regular compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's not worth the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they're worth the money if
you know the qualities there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, is that just like compost,
it can be made from anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compost doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a generic term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worm castings doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes you'll find people feeding
really low end products and purine a worm
[SPEAKER_02]: chow and just kind of the bare minimum to
the worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they're producing worms for fishing and
the castings are a waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no thought into what goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At home, you can recycle waste like
newspaper and stuff, or you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: feed thermophilic compost with premium
plant materials and be actually after
[SPEAKER_02]: creating the perfect compost or for you,
the perfect compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's always going to be quality
differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference with worm castings is
they're always expensive and they're often
[SPEAKER_02]: not the same quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you find a good source,
you know what their feedstock is and you
[SPEAKER_02]: like them, they're probably worth the
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times once you find that
quality casting and they're produced in
[SPEAKER_02]: volume, they're not as expensive as the
lower quality stuff that's bagged up and
[SPEAKER_02]: produced in large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at your house, I would really
encourage you to set up your own worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the biggest difference maker
in an organic garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows you to get worms for a much
lower cost and put them in your containers
[SPEAKER_02]: from your own worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You breed this consortium of predator
mites and rogue beetles and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: things start to come together and they
help complete that no-till ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But beyond that, you also have some
extras.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I was just going to get high quality
compost or high quality castings,
[SPEAKER_02]: the difference to me is that castings are
typically a lot more bang for the buck and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can make teas from them that go
further.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more nutrient dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we learned a while ago following
Coot's recipe of using one third castings
[SPEAKER_02]: was just a recipe for failure when it came
to the available castings on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just too salty or they're too rich
in potassium or some ingredient based on
[SPEAKER_02]: how they're produced where using such a
high volume produces a lot of issues at
[SPEAKER_02]: least in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: His vermicompost is very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a long time to make and it's
produced from materials that he has
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of and it's balanced and it's
produced with the end result of having
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he can do it at the high volume
that he does and have really, really good
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll experience that also at home if
you're able to make your own castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we keep going back to this thing
where we're talking about micronization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take worms and you work a compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a smaller end result.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red wigglers that we prefer will break
it down into very, very small pieces of
[SPEAKER_02]: individual castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one of those coated in calcium
carbonate, which is part of that balance
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil and coated in bacteria and
enzymes and secondary metabolites from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that we fed through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is all richer thermophilic
compost, which can destroy a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two complement each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're best used in combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you don't have the budget for the
castings, it makes sense that if you just
[SPEAKER_02]: put worms in a container, you're going to
make your own castings on demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can set up your own worm bed,
you can just work more affordable compost
[SPEAKER_02]: into castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that from a budget
perspective, when we work with larger
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, we just don't see people buying
$20,000 of castings to do the luxury top
[SPEAKER_02]: dresses and tees nonstop because you get
very good results from the quality compost
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you can put worms right in the
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a question people have been asking me a
lot and I don't have a very good answer
[SPEAKER_01]: for them is fabric pots versus those
plastic smart pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some people who say to me,
they think the plastic smart pots are
[SPEAKER_01]: better because it's like easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of the complaints around
fabric pots are how, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you water them, sometimes it comes
out the side and it's not actually
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrating down as well as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always reply to that saying to me,
that sounds like you just need to become a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more familiar with how to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the problem you're
discussing, but I think over time you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: learn to avoid that and kind of learn to
water better within them.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the plastic pots, they avoid that
issue because there's all the holes on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of them, but the top ones,
there's no holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water has to penetrate down first
before it even has a chance to leak out
[SPEAKER_01]: the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you got any opinions on these ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you think fabrics better than
plastic smart pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely have an opinion there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's similar to yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be clear, I think so the plastic out
here, the smart pot is a brand from High
[SPEAKER_02]: Caliber and they're a fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the plastic smart pot that you're
mentioning, like not a recycled plastic,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like a hard black nursery pot,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got these like the concave and convex
ridges around the outside with the holes
[SPEAKER_01]: in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've used all sorts of things and
I've used plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that there's really an
issue there, but I'll highlight on a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple subjects.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them being agronomists I talked to
and top soil and the microbial life and
[SPEAKER_02]: Ingham and a lot of the stuff we've talked
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That conversation revolves around aerobic
activity and that means more oxygen than
[SPEAKER_02]: not or air in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that can be done by having a highly
aerated mix and having soil texture that
[SPEAKER_02]: allows oxygen to stay in there and the
porosity of the drainage or the aeration
[SPEAKER_02]: material.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to add to that, when you're trying to
create this larger soil, which one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: problems can be over watering,
it makes sense to have a fabric container
[SPEAKER_02]: that allows you to air prune the roots and
create that benefit where it doesn't wrap
[SPEAKER_02]: around where it actually air prunes and
sends a signal for new root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also makes sense because the air
that it let in through the sides and
[SPEAKER_02]: creates this diversity of moisture zones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you mentioned, once you start
using either a wetting agent or watering
[SPEAKER_02]: properly, slowly, more often, whatever it
takes, you'll stop that running out the
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be an issue whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it does happen, it'll more
importantly highlight that you're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: getting dry pockets and there may be a
bigger issue and it's time that you slowed
[SPEAKER_02]: down and water properly because you're
cutting corners and now all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_02]: it's running out of the side of your
fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I have a really good grow and things
are going really well, it seems that's
[SPEAKER_02]: never an issue because I've been tending
to it so often that the slow watering,
[SPEAKER_02]: the constant tension, means that it's at
an even moisture level the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And around the edges, it's slightly drier
and there's this like root pruning that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's why a larger
container does work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also when I'm vermicomposting,
using that breathable container means the
[SPEAKER_02]: worms are going to be more alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biology is going to be more aerobic
and it's not going to ferment on accident
[SPEAKER_02]: or kill all the worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like it gives you an
advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, out here in Colorado,
it's super dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so outdoors, if you're not able to
water consistently and you don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: big enough container, maybe something with
solid sides would be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worms do just fine in a plastic worm bin
as long as you don't overwater and your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants will do really good in a plastic
container as long as you don't overwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're someone who wants to water
less, maybe that's important and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll work for you, but I just tend to use
the fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they work really well for our
style and it's always what I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: taught and I've tried, you know,
to go back and forth and I ended up using
[SPEAKER_02]: fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just suggest if that you
haven't tried a fabric one versus a
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic, or if you haven't, you're having
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to someone who has used one and make
sure you're using it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember last time we spoke,
I think ultimately I kind of got the
[SPEAKER_01]: answer out of you that if you had to
choose between having a cover crop or top
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing, if you could just do one or the
other, you would take top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the recent pictures I saw,
I noticed you have a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was a bit surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in like the very following video,
you just dumped a bunch of soil on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was thinking, have you changed
your mind back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe you think the two are good now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where do you sit on that one now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess one of the habits that I've
noticed that successful people have is
[SPEAKER_02]: they typically like to have both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll always hear that phrase,
you can't have your cake and eat it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody says, no, I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'd be better to have both.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phrase is actually a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you can't eat your cake and have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how you say it, it means
something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing goes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have cover crop or top dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're both really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the cover crop because it's fun to
see more of a diverse crop growing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The challenges that I mentioned before
were if I just told everybody to cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop, a lot of times there's a lot lost in
communication or lost in translation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden they have six foot
tall cover crop growing out of their
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a five inch tall cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it becomes competitive against the
main crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just recommended people,
if I was going to choose one, to do top
[SPEAKER_02]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be more effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we look at large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden we're looking at an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense at all,
the top dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover crop becomes the absolute gold
standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be managed over the long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you use animal husbandry,
that's kind of how you get that top
[SPEAKER_02]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then depending on soil testing,
you can always amend, but it's just so
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like there's always room for
both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that mindset whenever I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to have to pick one thing
versus the other if they're both good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can certainly abuse both of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm doing in this grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a lot of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just touching back on the soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is it to soil test in the
sense of, do you think if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonably consistent in your inputs and
you're, how should I put this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a stupid person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You read the plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try to keep a bit of an idea of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think you can get away with not
using a soil test and just getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: pots to go time and time again with a bit
of knowledge and some research at times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think at the end of the day,
you do really need to get a soil test at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise things will become unmanageable
and you're probably not going to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to self-diagnose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the difference on who is who is
asking the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean by that is that if you are
somebody who is depending on your crop
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the production that's coming
from it, then you can't afford to have
[SPEAKER_02]: variations in yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't afford to have things that take
time to balance or the results that come
[SPEAKER_02]: from not having the soil testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can totally get away with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The average gardener is not going to
benefit hugely from getting the soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the reason why.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting with recipes where we know
every input.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different than testing your native
soil, which may have some great
[SPEAKER_02]: disparities in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The then difference becomes, like you
said, not messing it up or just not being
[SPEAKER_02]: stupid and really pushing your soil one
direction or the other and using products
[SPEAKER_02]: that may not be acceptable or copious
amounts of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that most gardeners will have
tremendous success never using a soil
[SPEAKER_02]: test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like they're not going to need a
microscope to brew compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as you're relying on the
budget, I think soil testing will be the
[SPEAKER_02]: most affordable difference maker because
it can highlight some things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of a sudden there's no yield and
you just keep trying all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: things, but none of it overcame the fact
there's no boron in the soil and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: causing a major deficiency that you
weren't aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very often that we see such an
aha moment when we do a soil test because
[SPEAKER_02]: soil testing is not super accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot lacking depending on
how it's tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go really deep into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to weigh the soil to get the
results to be what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't weigh it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different considerations
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times the soil test can sometimes
start to provide some problems for the
[SPEAKER_02]: grower depending on how they interpret
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like most gardeners can just go
without it, but once you start to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand it, like once you read Steve
Solomon's book, you go, oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of me just doing as he says,
put some more on it, have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, which does work in organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just highlighted if you're missing
something that everything doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: like boron or manganese or whatever it may
be that's deficient, you're never going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get there by just adding a whole bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's changing a little bit when we look
at no-till because some of the ingredients
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're using cover those bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are using a little bit of kelp,
if you are using some dynamic accumulators
[SPEAKER_02]: that are really well-rounded like in the
Kutz mix, it's much harder to have an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue that a soil test is going to be
required to fix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess to continue this long thought,
when I started testing our soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was holding my breath because I was
really scared to see what the results
were.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as what I read was good,
even though I knew our soil worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny to find that Koot,
although he's not a fan of soil testing
[SPEAKER_02]: and doesn't really advocate for it based
on his requirements, his recipe follows
[SPEAKER_02]: the profile and fits a soil test perfectly
when done with good compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, Solomon and Koot ended up at
the same place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it was from the gut or from the
soil test, I think the main difference is
[SPEAKER_02]: in those micronutrients, which kelp meal
can't necessarily overcome them from scale
[SPEAKER_02]: in production as far as end times and
having to produce your own food and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually live off of it and nutrient
deficiencies would become much more
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as maybe a bit of a weird question,
have you ever heard of anyone doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I guess in the worst-case scenario,
any possible negative health effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to bakashi pet waste?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that's something a few of the
bakashi companies are pushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got these kits where you can put
the pet manure into it and I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: say you put it in the ground and then it's
similar to the regular bakashi when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard of anyone doing that,
or would you be apprehensive?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't use it for the garden,
just like any off-the-grid setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're actually going to be using your
own waste and it becomes valuable,
[SPEAKER_02]: your animal's waste, you have to
understand whether it's something that can
[SPEAKER_02]: be used on a food crop, whether it's
composted, whether it's gray water,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this stuff is not to be used on
your main crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be to grow something else that
feeds something else and then is
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually used.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's just kind of my thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to know your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing a top dress of a whole
bunch of amendments, maybe at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cycle, you're chucking a whole bunch
of new goodies on top, do you like to
[SPEAKER_01]: blend them all up if possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I noticed is I seem to get a
crazy increase in bug numbers if you blend
[SPEAKER_01]: it up and that's kind of a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the higher surface area,
more stuff available for bugs to eat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in one instance, I noticed it almost
got too out of control and it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: full on and I was getting a bit worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost started to think, maybe I
shouldn't blend up the malt barley and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff because I think that was the source
of the issue anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But long story short, yeah, do you have an
opinion on whether you should really try
[SPEAKER_01]: to almost micronize your top dress like
we've mentioned or sorry, micronize like
[SPEAKER_01]: we've mentioned the top dress or do you
view it as more of like a longer lasting
[SPEAKER_01]: and it kind of leaching the nutrients out
slowly?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it depends on what we're after.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we know we're after a singular
ingredient, it's going to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're using a little bit more
intelligence to create a product,
[SPEAKER_02]: at home we can get away by using a little
bit extra of a raw material.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I'm going to buy an amino acid
product, I want it to be the purest and
[SPEAKER_02]: the most available because of the shipping
and the cost that goes into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you consider all things being the
same and you're going to either blend an
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredient or not at home, I tend to buy
stuff like most of us that's at least
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the most part, that difference in
texture to me provides a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: fast release, a little bit of slow release
and a little bit of really slow release
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the size of ingredient and
texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never really blend it up like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done the malted barley and ground it
up really fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find that you can use smaller
amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you notice an increased level of
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've also played with in our new
soil recipe that I've got in a four by
[SPEAKER_02]: four geo planter over some grow stone as
kind of a makeshift sub-irrigated planter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mixed malted barley into that soil
recipe and it was milled, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like a chunky texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like taking each of the barley seed
and breaking it into maybe four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces and mashing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really a fine powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we find that that worked really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hope that the soil test comes back
on it and it looks equally well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants in it are doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I micronized it, it may have
even increased the effect of how hot the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil temperature got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's another thing to consider
when you're mixing soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you micronize everything besides just
the top dressing, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can cause some effects where just
everything is released so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So consider what you're using it for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess factor that in when you're
going to consider grinding something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the recent videos you put up
that really caught my eye was one about
[SPEAKER_01]: spinosads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said that people had had lab tests
that were like testing hot when they had
[SPEAKER_01]: used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your mind, does this kind of put it in
like maybe not the same category,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like a similar category as using like
abomectin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you like, you know, would you
avoid smoking something that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: test positive for spinosad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it's like a much more
safer thing than the usual things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are not wanting to test positive?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not worried about the spinosad at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I guess maybe I should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for whatever reason, I feel it's
natural enough and how they found it,
[SPEAKER_02]: how it's been used for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any really negative
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there's kind of some
bandwagoning that happens when people hear
[SPEAKER_02]: something about it and jump on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I heard through the grapevine that
people were testing hop for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really did a lot of my own
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just kind of previously mentioned
that that's the story that's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll notice deeper in that post,
we got into another conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing a little bit of a devil's
advocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted that post to get some
conversation and have people talking
[SPEAKER_02]: because I knew someone would say it's
going to kill bees and I knew someone
[SPEAKER_02]: would say that you're going to fail
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I happen to know that since then people
have been using that product out of
[SPEAKER_02]: curiosity and using it according to the
directions and they're not failing
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, even when using it in flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also find people that are saying
that it doesn't hurt the bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did some research and there's white
paper showing that when used properly,
[SPEAKER_02]: for instance, not spraying it on bees,
it doesn't hurt them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, water would hurt bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: A stick would hurt them if I go knock
their nest down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like you have to take
everything with a little bit of grain of
[SPEAKER_02]: salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people were recommending other
products that were supposedly safe for
[SPEAKER_02]: bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I researched those products,
it said very clearly on the label not to
[SPEAKER_02]: use it around bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so bees has become kind of the new,
I love bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely want them to be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want no issues with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's become like a new hype word where
everybody's scared about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like for a while it got a
little out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the consensus in the
scientific community is the spinoset is
[SPEAKER_02]: safe and it doesn't hurt the bees when
used appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And outdoors that means using it at night
when the bees aren't on your flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means probably not using it in
flour because you shouldn't need to if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's used properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would eliminate all of the reason
for concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Avram acted as a de-warming agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that I would be concerned with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: When someone says it tests hot,
that doesn't mean it's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that they tested for it and it
was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that also is indicative of
them using it probably incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just as a bit of a general
question, how do you feel about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragonfly Earth medicine products?
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you guys ever consider stocking
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: People have asked us that in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really been a huge reason to
as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean by that is everyone has their
own style of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying not to dictate that style.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by doing so, I carry products that
are a little bit more ubiquitous in use
[SPEAKER_02]: and aren't so... I guess their formulas,
a lot of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I look at an ingredient list,
I oftentimes find myself not wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase certain products because I want
to have a more singular product available
[SPEAKER_02]: to my customer, like the amino acid,
where there's one ingredient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The root-wise, I know a lot more about
those microbial products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humic acid material that's used in
their product, I don't like at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's clearly labeled on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the red flags went off right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether that's right or wrong,
how I was taught to research ingredients
[SPEAKER_02]: had told me that a certain of the products
I didn't want to share with my customers
[SPEAKER_02]: in the sense that I wasn't certain about
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I since found that a lot of our
customers use their products and
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found myself in a position where
I was thinking, okay, well, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously our products that are being
effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are in alignment with our customer's
core beliefs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what's in them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them have some interesting
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I was to be someone who really
wanted to get the product, just the type
[SPEAKER_02]: of person that I am would probably lead me
to making my own, buying some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that they're transparent about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't want to go to all the
work of making your own stuff and you like
[SPEAKER_02]: their ingredients, you can go buy their
products and use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, there's a whole
community of people that can kind of tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you how to work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been this interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have never carried them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just don't really have an interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of it is I don't think I could
really help them, their brand at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that buys Build-A-Soil can
certainly go get their Dragonfly directly
[SPEAKER_02]: from them or from someone probably even
closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done a great job of getting their
products out there in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appropriate answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a few questions on IPM here.
[SPEAKER_01]: An interesting one I've been thinking
about is, have you ever noticed a
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful effect from the use of
diatomaceous earth in regards to IPM?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I see people use it,
I generally try to follow up and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: how did you find it to work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them give the same answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as your water gets clumpy,
don't think it has really any effect after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that it's just quite hard to
manage and use in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find it works?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, what's the best way to
optimally use it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice a recent post that we put on
Instagram highlights this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a little bit messy how we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may not be the ideal approach,
but it's the only way that I've found to
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll share that methodology with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: At work, we have a warm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hanging warm-in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a breathable fabric, very similar to
a backpack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows it to hold about four cubic
feet of heavy compost with worms in it up
[SPEAKER_02]: on this two by four stand that we built.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a bucket underneath it to pull
the worm castings out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the top, it's got a zipper net that
keeps most of the flies in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But typically there's none.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vermicomposting is really clean when
done right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We top-dressed from an outside container
that had sunflowers and a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and compost tea scraps and stuff in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it brought in a ton of fungus net and
fly larva and all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was just full underneath this
net.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them were flying through
because they were so small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we put about an inch layer all the
way across with diatomaceous earth just
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're not growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanted to see if it would really
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in the past, I would just dust a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never had any good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I used too much, it would clump up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, I got to tell you, the gnats were
instantly gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flies were instantly gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had such a dramatic effect within 48
hours that I thought, man, I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: missing the boat on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it is just any barrier will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to say that diatomaceous
earth is necessarily the most important
[SPEAKER_02]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like most of my tools to be
multifunction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just so happens that if you're
going to make a barrier, diatomaceous
[SPEAKER_02]: earth is a very good way to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we didn't get around the
problems were this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We top-dressed with about a half pound of
diatomaceous earth food grade per 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 15-gallon plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It created a half-inch layer all the way
across the entire top-dressed surface
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it immediately suffocated any attempt
at fungus gnats to live in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The larva that would have hatched come
through and die.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flyers can't lay eggs in it because
it's so thick and dry and powdery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just die when they land in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can't fly away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it causes problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just interrupts everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also did it because we had
thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have part of the life cycle in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so within 48 hours, same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing moving in that tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as flying around flies gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm hoping it had the same effect
on the thrip larva.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then instead of trying to water
through it because we did a half-inch
[SPEAKER_02]: thick layer, just decided, hey,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think two pounds that we ended up using
were like a dollar worth of material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe less than that, depending on the
quantity you buy it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took the shop vac and just sucked it
right off the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it came off.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the top-dress stayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since the problem has been completely
eliminated, as far as anything flying
[SPEAKER_02]: around in there, and I think if you do
that same process, we'll have the same
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you won't have to try and water
through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, it's still dusty and it's
a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are other ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as I can tell, it's basically
100% effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to give that a go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one question I get asked in regards to
kind of IPM or like at the extreme end of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and I just really don't have a good
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been able to get one either,
is let's just say you're a first-time
[SPEAKER_01]: grower because normally it's the
first-time growers who have this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a first-time grower and you're
worried about getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites or like, you know,
one of the more nasty things in flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have any real options to get rid of
them once you're in flower, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, let's just say you're at
week four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely buds there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your options realistically for
mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there's a lot more options
than people give credit for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the community of cannabis
cultivators end up creating this
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation that's taboo and it's
spraying anything on a flower as if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to melt your buds and it's
going to be in all the bud that you smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fold your spray and it will not
end up in the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very low dilution rates of things like
essential oil or additives will volatize
[SPEAKER_02]: and off-gas and be completely gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be, you know, hit with the light
and the air and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's something else to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not going to spray your plants
with something, even your buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when growing outdoors or in a
greenhouse or even in your grow tent,
[SPEAKER_02]: nature's going to be spraying them
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be bacteria, indigenous
floating in the air that's going to land
[SPEAKER_02]: on there and there's going to be dirt,
debris and other stuff floating around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have like a complete sterile
HEPA filtered everything room,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still some chance of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people wash their buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people aren't terribly concerned with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people make concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, I think that foliar
spraying really doesn't have a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: negative effect on the end result,
especially in those first four weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as you get closer to harvest,
it definitely can cause a huge issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when products are abused.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen really safe results using EM1
mixed with Tweetment, which is an enzyme
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaner, or just using the Tweetment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other products on the market like it would
be like Dr. Zymes and Big Time
[SPEAKER_02]: Exterminator and some of the other
enzyme-based sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always recommend following like a
quarter dose or a half dose for any
[SPEAKER_02]: recommended, anything that the
manufacturer says, and that way you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be safe, especially in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also make sure that you have
airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that you're not going to
harvest, you know, the next week,
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly if you're at week four and
you've got spider mites or if you notice a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit, I would much rather see you
spray something very natural, like maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: homemade EM5.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to tarragonics.com and look up
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use essential oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use enzyme sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, I think people even using low
dilutions of nemoils and stuff would
[SPEAKER_02]: probably be even safe on certain genetics
at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it affects their
concentrates, but certainly the enzyme
[SPEAKER_02]: products don't, and some of the homemade
products and the essential oils don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd be comfortable recommending
that as long as they use the emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was no later than say
week six at the latest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you heard the idea being thrown
around at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just preface this by saying you
certainly didn't advocate this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some people have thrown around the
idea that cannabis hyperanemis is possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: just actually a code name for azadactrin
poisoning, AKA neem poisoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that were true, it could,
you know, give credence to the idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: people who do experiences have maybe just
actually ingested some weed that was
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed with neem laid in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard anything along those lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's grasping for straws.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any correlation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it makes a lot of sense when
you start thinking about it and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, people spray stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to be what it is, not our
beloved plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there's people out there
that react differently to everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: good and bad, and these are natural
products that are quite potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've certainly used quite a
bit of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wouldn't be surprised if there
are different times in my life where the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant treats me differently based on what
my needs are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had some people close to me in my
life that went through a potential
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis hypermesis or whatever the doctor
wanted to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really frustrating for most
people to go through this is they feel
[SPEAKER_02]: they're being written off with some random
word that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just being told that they
smoke too much to go back home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a really underlying
medical cause for concern there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that may not be caused
by cannabis, but maybe during that time
[SPEAKER_02]: accentuated by it or highlighted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen that it's not directly
correlated to the azadirachtrin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the case, I would say that
the only way it's possible is from
[SPEAKER_02]: azadirachtrin extracts, which are,
in my opinion, abused because of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, high amounts of parts per
million of percentage of this one singular
[SPEAKER_02]: plant constituent, which to me is,
doesn't have that synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That natural safe effect, like a plant
based neem oil would have that you can use
[SPEAKER_02]: topically internally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has been used for thousands of
years without any sort of hypermesis
[SPEAKER_02]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I've noticed is really trending
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, lactobacillus, it's the shit at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everyone's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's one of those ones where
it's super easy to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that probably adds to why it's
gaining so much momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing I've heard from some friends
who I try to trust their opinions greatly
[SPEAKER_01]: is they reckon that using it to flush your
plants is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard anything along those lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard things like that, kind of like
a bacterial flush where you put it through
[SPEAKER_02]: in a lactobacillus, which is really good
at breaking down organic material goes
[SPEAKER_02]: through and supposedly flushes your plants
or eats the salts out or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really mess around with that too
much in the sense that I don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: reason to flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not growing in that style where I use
it for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another reason I think is a lot of people
mix it with molasses to stabilize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea that molasses uses the end
of the flush kind of goes along with that
[SPEAKER_02]: thought methodology and lends itself to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the molasses thing that I just
mentioned, oftentimes if you look in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past, people would use molasses at the end
of their growth cycle to kind of flush and
[SPEAKER_02]: flush with sugars or whatever that meant
to kind of sweeten the buds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't really follow any of those
practices, but I see lactobacillus
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming a trend because of a couple of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It provides some nitrogens, amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a soluble organic nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some probiotic advantages to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Challenges that I have, you know,
I don't buy a lot of milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now all of a sudden I'm going to
buy a jug of milk just for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's coming from a cow that was fed
GMO corn or, you know, fat or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fed a dairy and it's eating good grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but a lot of times the whole
process is in a huge industry I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: support and start making tons of
fertilizer off of purchased milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I happen to have milk on the
farm or it's a waste and the milk goes bad
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can make it, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have lacto around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've got other products like this
amino acid product that I think works a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lacto is cheap to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those products that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a cool factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to be here to stay
and people will be using it for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, beyond that, I just,
I think that people, most people that I
[SPEAKER_02]: know when they make it for a long time,
they get to the point where it's just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like, okay, am I going to make a
routine where I make this every so often,
[SPEAKER_02]: make a ton of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I activate it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I do it once a year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I do it all often?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just becomes kind of an unnecessary
process, at least in a no-till
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, especially when I've got like
this powdered amino that I think just is
[SPEAKER_02]: so much more effective and easier for me
to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I didn't have that and I didn't
want to buy a product, I think that this
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the go-to first thing that people
would want to make as far as a
[SPEAKER_02]: do-it-yourself plant fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't really seen any major,
major breakthroughs in terms of extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: effective organic methods of killing pests
and bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you know, I mean, there's been
developments in, you know, the use of the
[SPEAKER_01]: essential oils with the neem and with the
silica, you know, so the combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: all those is certainly effective,
but I'm talking about things on the level
[SPEAKER_01]: of like chemicals where, you know,
like you're using the product and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really wiping everything out pretty
much quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or instantly almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought about it and it's seems like
using biological agents like predators or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe like enzymes that are just
so powerful and specific that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they literally just rip things
apart similar to the way like a really
[SPEAKER_01]: chemically based one would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's possibly like a future
we could come to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think like it's not really
technically viable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think the demand would need to
be right to develop such products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like the Californian market is big
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the demand would be there for like,
you know, like really good organic pest
[SPEAKER_01]: killers that are really effective
consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the market's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the demand's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to see products like
that and they will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've read Paul Stamets' Mycelium
Running and looked down the rabbit hole of
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus, you'll see that he's worked on a
number of different effective ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize fungus to kill pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things he talks about in
the book is I believe termites and using
[SPEAKER_02]: creating like, for instance, I think it
was ants or termites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember which one this one is
relative to, but they were smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would sense the material that was
poisoned to them in the fungus and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: an odor or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't bring it back to the nest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if they did, they had guards that
would then dispose of the product before
[SPEAKER_02]: it got back to the queen, which is really
what you want to infect to kill the
[SPEAKER_02]: colony, I guess in this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were able to produce mushrooms
that didn't either spore or created a
[SPEAKER_02]: different result in how they were grown so
that it lacked the property that tipped
[SPEAKER_02]: the ants off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of a sudden, they would just go
harvest this stuff as if it was the best
[SPEAKER_02]: food they could find and bring it back to
the queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody would give it to her and
everybody'd share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would all die very quickly
because the fungus would completely take
[SPEAKER_02]: them over from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like there's going to be
opportunity where it's very specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, is that most of the time
when you think of a overall blanket
[SPEAKER_02]: targeting effect where just a eradicates
pests, it doesn't necessarily fit nature's
[SPEAKER_02]: profile because they'll kill good and bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And neem oil is fantastic because it
typically only kills the herbivores that
[SPEAKER_02]: are eating the plant, not the pest eating
beneficials that we want to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will look at other products like
the spinosad and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't just blanket target everything
and eradicate every stage from adult to
[SPEAKER_02]: larva to nymph.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it affects them all differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that in nature at least,
it makes sense that you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_02]: such a clear cut killer because it breaks
some of the rules of making it possible
[SPEAKER_02]: for something dramatically bad to happen
out there where everything just gets wiped
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the stories that I remember
reading about, and I think it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: 40,000, some agricultural book about the
Asian horticultural practices and farming
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the stories was about a long,
long time ago, a king that wanted to be
[SPEAKER_02]: great told his people that there was a few
different things that were causing major
[SPEAKER_02]: problems for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they got rid of them, they would be
just, if they got rid of all of them 100%,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would be rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a bird that was eating their
grain and it was like a bug that was
[SPEAKER_02]: causing problems and whatever the pests
were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they went and they killed all of
the mice or they killed all the birds and
[SPEAKER_02]: they killed all of those bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was basically like called upon by
the nation to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone had to work endlessly to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had the worst season ever because
unbeknownst to them, the bird ate a bug
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually ate the crop and kept it in
balance, even though they did take some
[SPEAKER_02]: grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unbeknownst to them, the mice or
whatever it was caused some other
[SPEAKER_02]: function.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was integral to the ecosystem and its
function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't pretend to know why all
these bugs are there, but I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: Masanobo Fukuoka mentioned that every year
the bug life from an entomology
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective was different and the
predators were different and the bugs that
[SPEAKER_02]: flourish were different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you just wiped one of them out,
it may cause something else to come in and
[SPEAKER_02]: wipe you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's interesting that I feel like
we're going to have tools like the fungus
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have stuff that kills it,
but it should be more selective in
[SPEAKER_02]: organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we're always going to have
to use multiple tools to avoid that
[SPEAKER_02]: problem of eradicating everything and
causing your own problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of beat around the bush a lot,
but it's just... I think that's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I wanted to delve more into
was the SAR response.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another kind of little hot topic at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I'm not sure if it's been
specifically said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people are kind of interested
is, do you think by activating the SAR
[SPEAKER_01]: response in a plant, you do increase
terpene and resin or like there's a chance
[SPEAKER_01]: it would?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what I'm interested in
knowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like a direct response or like
there's a chance it'll increase terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: as a result of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there is going to at some
point be for sure a direct response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're already there where we
can say, that when we look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: salicylic acid, jasmine acid pathway,
which a lot of times what we're keying
[SPEAKER_02]: into when we talk about the systemic
required resistance, it plugs into this
[SPEAKER_02]: network the plant uses to communicate to
other plants and to more accurately
[SPEAKER_02]: prepare for adverse conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a plant can't just get up and run away
from a storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it has to weather through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't just get up and run away from
pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to defend itself and stay right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this SAR response, the idea is,
is that in nature we can witness where one
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is infested and it sends out a
hormone that activates the other plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: SAR response and now they start preparing
their defenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's interesting is typically those
defenses are medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The alkaloids, the properties that they
create are the secondary metabolites that
[SPEAKER_02]: are not primary to normal growth function
like a leaf or a stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these secondary properties are then
increased to be a pest aside or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: that SAR response triggered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our plant, we're thinking that
triggering the SAR defense response
[SPEAKER_02]: without actually hurting the plant will
give us a benefit of turning on more THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing terpene and terpenoid that
might be the actual plant defense system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's evidence that leads directly
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a lot of sense then from a plant
constituent standpoint, that's what the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then there's correlating studies,
which you can Google after this and find
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's been studies on tobacco and I
think on tomato, both that have trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were to scope it, they look
like trichomes on a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were dramatically increased when the
big, like the wild sage plant that's all
[SPEAKER_02]: across the United States, when that plant
was intact by pests near the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco or tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they then did tests where they
would release the methyl jasmineate from
[SPEAKER_02]: the sage plant and it would activate the
SAR and activate the actual jasmineic
[SPEAKER_02]: response system in the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like the jasmineic side of it
is towards finishing or senescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where you'll see products
like terpenator and other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people think that they're playing
with jasmineic acid to induce these
[SPEAKER_02]: responses above and beyond just the
sulfur, then they lend itself to the
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you start looking at jasmineic
acid, I think you'll be excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been wanting to just top dress with
some sage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually bought some jasmine oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a way to maybe spray on the top dress,
but I haven't had time to do a real side
[SPEAKER_02]: by side and haven't found a way to maybe
send it to a lab and differentiate
[SPEAKER_02]: accurately what the results are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to do that and we'll see if
it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess that's my thoughts on some
of these products that might stimulate the
[SPEAKER_02]: SAR.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's for sure going to get us more
terpenes, more THC, but it's just a matter
[SPEAKER_02]: of how much, which product, how does it
actually work?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we're really there yet,
at least on a scalable level.
[SPEAKER_01]: An interesting point you brought up was
the terpenator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of people talk about this
one and the most common thing I hear is it
[SPEAKER_01]: increases terpene productions,
but it causes everything to kind of smell
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, yeah, if that is
jasmineic acid, do you think like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: like oversaturation of the receptor and
then that's what causes everything to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think like, I don't know,
I almost tend to think that maybe it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: because if everything comes out the same,
maybe there's just something in there
[SPEAKER_01]: which is then being uptaken and you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so confusing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the type of conversations that I
like to have as far as the unknown
[SPEAKER_02]: territory.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you really get into it and being in
the industry and talking about this stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: every day, a lot of it is just the same
conversation over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you start talking about this
stuff, it's exciting because to me it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, well, the terpenator, across the
board, we've heard people, the consensus
[SPEAKER_02]: is, like you said, that it creates this
blandum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it's just the people
that tend to use those products that are
[SPEAKER_02]: attracted to them and the genetics they're
using, maybe it's not fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's just a judgment that's come
in across and the style of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like some of the growers I've
heard that from, I trust and respect what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so without having used it personally,
I'm just going to say that let's say for
[SPEAKER_02]: argument's sake, it does make everything
taste the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're looking at jasmineic acid as
potential for one of the reasons why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so increasing that and artificially
stimulating that SAR through the jasmineic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid profile, potentially it only
stimulates certain ones that the plant can
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe focus on with less energy or
whatever that symptom is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it lends itself to the fact that
that product terpenator is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: just using jasmineic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we're completely off base,
totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's leading things to stay
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to do a test where we actually
compare the jasmineic acid, see if there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a difference, then now run
that against the terpenator and see if we
[SPEAKER_02]: can correlate those differences to be
similar or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'd like to think there's a way to
increase production without actually
[SPEAKER_02]: making everything bland or making
everything similar, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what we want to do in
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to take the biggest yield without
ever crossing the line of ruining those
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profiles and lowering the quality
of the result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we can find a way to increase
those expressions, that means that maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: we can follow that with yield as well as
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's definitely worth talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played with any salicylic acid or
anything like that or jasmineic acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried crazy levels of salicylic just
through lots of alloy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've never noticed any detrimental
effects through that, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, me either.
[SPEAKER_02]: The consensus out there based on the
research is that we should avoid using the
[SPEAKER_02]: salicylic acid as we go into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on the fact the plant kind of sees
it like a light switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either on the salicylic acid side or
the jasmineic acid side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using the salicylic acid may potentially
delay senescence, create a longer
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering period, which could be
beneficial in some cases, but not others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm intrigued by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started using alloy all the way
through the cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started using lots of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't notice this delayed senescence or
this negative effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that led me into the next postulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that there is not enough salicylic
acid in the alloy to ever be a concern?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that using just like aspirin or maybe
a salicylic acid extract would actually
[SPEAKER_02]: cause these negative effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it's just too much of a direct
interpretation of the latest research on
[SPEAKER_02]: these components.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's more complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in time we'll find out,
but I need to do a lot more testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the community does too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think maybe ultimately the only
safe products to use to increase terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: content is stuff with known sulfur in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sulfur certainly works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a huge part of the
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the biggest difference is
going to be if you're low on sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I noticed right
away when we were making our potting soils
[SPEAKER_02]: is that luxury amounts of sulfur didn't
cause a problem on the plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the reasons why this
happened is when I first made a Kootz mix
[SPEAKER_02]: in the beginning, I actually made it twice
because, and I could probably find a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation, but Kootz told me to just
get rock dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because like you said, it's more of a
methodology than an exact list,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least over time how it's evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called him and said, well, I found this
gypsum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, sure, that's rock dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I used four cups per cubic foot of
just gypsum in a soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've come to find out it's very
different than rock dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that I finished that
conversation with him and had a laugh
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, but I had really good results
with that growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whether it was the calcium or
whether it was the sulfur, I knew that
[SPEAKER_02]: having luxury levels of those wasn't going
to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since then on soil testing,
I'll notice all of our potting soils that
[SPEAKER_02]: we like usually have a lot more sulfur
than for instance, Solomon or some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: others might recommend on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But beyond that, I feel like peak plant
health, the lighting, the environment play
[SPEAKER_02]: key roles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously secondary from that,
once you get that harvest where there's
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum amount of production of turpines
and flavors, it's that slow to leak dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making sure everything's taken care
of for these volatile turps to not
[SPEAKER_02]: disappear on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the chlorophyll to go away and all
those other processes that happen during
[SPEAKER_02]: the finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really none of that matters if you
don't have the right genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we can look at every
terpene enhancer you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get the right cut, it'll change
your life as far as terpenes and as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: odor goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, getting a little bit more odor
out of the same cut sometimes almost seems
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous when you find something that is
that strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in organics, it just seems to be at
the peak production of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a sikwa, it just seems to be fully
there in organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to push it one way or another,
it doesn't surprise me to find that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: finding more bland taste when we push it
one direction or more uniform flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just holding out hope that we can
maybe squeeze more out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that circles back around and
looking at wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't been able to squeeze more out
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, to get more flavor, they actually
have less yield and more drought seasons
[SPEAKER_02]: and more harsh conditions kind of
activating that SAR.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I don't know the answer,
but I'm excited about the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to jump to something which I think
people have a bit more faith in its actual
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to increase resin and terpene
content, we've seen the rise of ceramic
[SPEAKER_01]: metal halides and the LEC lights,
which have kind of, how shall we say,
[SPEAKER_01]: overtaken just general metal halides in
people's usage nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you believe that these ones do likewise
increase the resin content?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really commonly quoted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I probably believe a little
bit myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, it just gives a more favorable
flavor profile, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, do you feel like it's kind of a
game of trying to stack all these things
[SPEAKER_01]: together, which maybe do cumulatively add
little bits of extra production here and
[SPEAKER_01]: there to result in a better end product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel that the ceramic metal
halide, we carry a product called Indomax
[SPEAKER_02]: made in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started off with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We noticed a difference over the typical
high pressure sodium or typical metal
[SPEAKER_02]: halide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And previous to that, I'd often use two
600s over a four by four area,
[SPEAKER_02]: one metal halide, one HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got really good results mixing the
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also played with flowering with both
bulbs and I've noticed that I can get
[SPEAKER_02]: similar results under metal halide as I
could high pressure sodium, maybe just
[SPEAKER_02]: different, maybe a little more frost,
maybe a little less yield, but ballpark,
[SPEAKER_02]: same numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when ceramic metal halide came out,
I kind of wrote it off and I wanted to use
[SPEAKER_02]: it in veg and still playing around in
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like the results were just
staggering in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: The health of the growth was just
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the power behind the lower wattage was
really intriguing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're still playing with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still learning how to use it
properly, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played around with using one 315 in a
four by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it works, I really think that
using two of them is going to be key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people will say the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even then, efficiency wise,
they work better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll circle back around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the terpene content and
the frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely noticed a better outcome when
using a more full spectrum light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether that's LED or CMH, I don't think
it matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that matters is that you're comparing
not the technology, but you're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: comparing the spectrum of output.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been so much further research
indicating that green light is such a
[SPEAKER_02]: powerful driver in this conversation
that's been cut out of most grow lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I've been heard it put is it's
like the grow lights we used before worked
[SPEAKER_02]: really well, but it's almost like junk
food for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the lights we're using now is like a
full spectrum health food diet of more
[SPEAKER_02]: finished, more complete spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the plants are able to show you their
genetic potential and fully complete their
[SPEAKER_02]: process better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to continue to get
better, but we're still making the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the sun does the best job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really amazing to see how powerful
these plants grow outdoors in the sun or
[SPEAKER_02]: in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's more behind it than
just the type of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mentioned, it's all about that
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say for sure more terpenes,
more frost and stuff out of a more quality
[SPEAKER_02]: full spectrum light, whatever the type of
light it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely agree with you on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an interesting idea I've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen plants before grown with just
water in a well built soil and they look
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've seen other plants looking
similar and in a well built soil just
[SPEAKER_01]: being given water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe they're given a tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're given, you know, a bit more
nutrients than the other one got,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't showing any signs of
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look very healthy in fact,
but then they have this like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this bloom of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes you realize, well,
maybe there are times when the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: could be, so to speak, eating more than
what's at the table, but it still looks
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonably happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you kind of agree with that analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, would that not lend to the idea
of like even with a well built soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe giving an additional, you know,
amino acid fertilizer here or there is not
[SPEAKER_01]: a bad idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with you a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've wrestled with this as far as the
romancing the idea of water only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, water only was something you
heard for so long in the no-till
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it was because if we were
really to show the hydro community,
[SPEAKER_02]: how kind of crazy we were and how much
stuff we wanted to do to try and do this
[SPEAKER_02]: organically, they'd just write us off as
loony like they already did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now coming around full circle,
if we could just build a soil and water
[SPEAKER_02]: only and actually do better than that,
it would, who's laughing now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's proven to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you have to use a larger
volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have a very quality soil and
not everybody can start off with that
[SPEAKER_02]: exact high quality, very balanced soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking from that perfect effect,
everybody's soil might be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: however many steps removed from that
perfect soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that even when you have the
perfect soil, as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: giving the plant an easier way to go and
not, not necessarily bypassing the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: food web, but making the work the soil
food web has to do easier and somehow more
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems to give the plant a faster speed of
growth that suits us well for our time
[SPEAKER_02]: frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now one of the things that I'll
consider though, is that when I started
[SPEAKER_02]: no-till, I was perpetually growing and for
my own needs, I would have a tent where I
[SPEAKER_02]: had several plants in there and the plant
in the left corner might be about to
[SPEAKER_02]: finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant next to it might be one week
behind and the plant next to that one week
[SPEAKER_02]: behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to tell you, in living soil,
that made my life easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had water in all, just water and they
all did great and I could harvest them all
[SPEAKER_02]: at different times and keep it perpetual.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll tell you that the reason why it
worked for me is because I was perpetual.
[SPEAKER_02]: The speed of the vegetative growth was
completely irrelevant to me as long as I
[SPEAKER_02]: had healthy plants of the appropriate size
on deck to go into flower when I needed
[SPEAKER_02]: them to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, I didn't necessarily
need to get the biggest yield as long as
[SPEAKER_02]: the best quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So adding extra things would only take
away from my budget and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: add a dramatic increase on my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think everybody needs to filter
it through their process that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're busy and you just need
some herb and you want it to be very good,
[SPEAKER_02]: build the soil, water it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not overthink this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not want someone to get in the garden
and go, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife is going to smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to have any of these
amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Build a Soil, we have a basic amendment
chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use purchased products and go
through a kind of a no-till grow with some
[SPEAKER_02]: additives that'll make it easier for you,
especially in a smaller container.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from there, instead of just doing the
water only like we talked about,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are so many things you can do to
speed up the process so it can fit your
[SPEAKER_02]: timeframe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can increase the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can play around with the
phenotypic expressions based on the inputs
[SPEAKER_02]: we're playing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what enthusiasts wouldn't want to
have a little bit of say in what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found that overwhelmingly most of
us no-till growers were wanting to do more
[SPEAKER_02]: than just water, whether it's a sprouted
seed tea and amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here the consensus across the board
is, well, you may not need to,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what you do, there's a
definite increased return on investment
[SPEAKER_02]: from doing a little bit of extra effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you probably found the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You alluded to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that been your experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've found is I've got this
awesome liquid aloe ferment from my homing
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the overall thing I wanted to quickly
mention is what I've found through my own
[SPEAKER_01]: experience is that the quality is always
superior the less you give it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've consistently had the highest
quality, in my opinion, when it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, I've almost found the
more you add a tea, the more you add these
[SPEAKER_01]: other things, it almost changes it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the terroir has always been the best
when it was just pure water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was interesting to me to see
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'm going to give that a go in
the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could resist the temptation to add
other stuff, which let's face it,
[SPEAKER_02]: the nature of Build A Soil, working with a
lot of people that if they're contacting
[SPEAKER_02]: me and asking me questions, sometimes it's
to have conversations like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more often than not, it's because
they're trying to learn the basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times they're in a five
gallon container.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't followed the rules right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a mulch player.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so using a lot of these secondary
products will produce really good results
[SPEAKER_02]: for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you, I've noticed that when the
plant is maybe forced to work as hard as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible to get all of its nutrients,
you may not get that biggest yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the quality is absolutely undeniable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I will add to
that is that when I noticed dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: that come online, get a whole bunch,
like a truckload of our soil, they fill up
[SPEAKER_02]: the room, they got a grower that knows how
to do the no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: They usually just crush their first round.
[SPEAKER_02]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's after that that it becomes
interesting when they're in containers to
[SPEAKER_02]: see if they keep the habits that will keep
yield up or whether they're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_02]: grab some of these products like aminos
and all the other stuff or whether you
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to just do water only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the home grower, I think you've got
kind of a luxury of having a small garden
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can do just water only and the
results really are pretty astounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'd like to do it side by side as
far as like back to back rounds once we
[SPEAKER_02]: start running the same cut over and over
again and we'll do the full system against
[SPEAKER_02]: water only and we'll compare terpene
profile yield and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be very interesting to see the
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that same kind of topic in mind,
do you think it's possible to overdo it
[SPEAKER_01]: with teas or are you just wasting tea at a
certain point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you get negative effects from tea
at some point or is it just wasting it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that depends on your definition of
tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like for the most part,
if you're doing something very diluted or
[SPEAKER_02]: just microbial in nature, pretty much just
waste an effort at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just going to be a diminishing
point of return where you don't see really
[SPEAKER_02]: increased plant growth and for the most
part, you could have probably just used
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean plants like water, you know,
you don't always have to give them
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other consideration is if
you're making a nutrient tea, you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it all the time, you can certainly overdo
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a point where you're putting just
so many soluble nutrients in there of one
[SPEAKER_02]: type or another that it's starting to skew
the balance that we worked so hard to get
[SPEAKER_02]: in a living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's great about living soil is it
can exchange nutrients positive or
negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Negatively, it can change the pH around
the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of that is predicated
upon the fact that there's not some
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent outside source constantly
changing what that soil actually is to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can overdo it when you do a lot
of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conversely, if you do top dressing,
it looks a little harder to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're going to be limited by the
space you have on top and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily directly interacting with the
rhizosphere so directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it's not so micronized
where it's carried right into that root
[SPEAKER_02]: zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So top dressing a little more forgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's why a lot of
no-till people that are doing water only
[SPEAKER_02]: will still do some top dressing because
we're removing biomass each cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unless we're adding something back to
the soil, we're eventually going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one idea I wanted to run by you though
is a few people had expressed this idea to
[SPEAKER_01]: me and I wanted to see if you think
there's any major flaw in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of was asking people like what they
thought a tea was actually doing for the
[SPEAKER_01]: micro life and the nutrients in their pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the general answer I got was it's kind
of a way of like artificially injecting
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and microbes into the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over a few days, it's going to kind of
decline, reestablish the new level and
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe that's when you'd apply another
tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's kind of the way it
works or it's that's like too simplistic
[SPEAKER_01]: of a view?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're all creating this picture in
our mind of what happens when we pour a
[SPEAKER_02]: tea on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can look at a microscope and see all
the biology that's in the tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take a bit of our soil and do a
paste like do a liquid extract of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: throw that under the scope and see the
biology that's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: As close as we can tell, a lot of it looks
pretty similar, but you know, Coot,
[SPEAKER_02]: he doesn't do any compost teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he teaches me, he goes, how the hell
am I supposed to know of all that bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: we're growing in a bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything like the bacteria that should be
growing on your soil in totally different
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's where we get the
people saying there has to be a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolved oxygen level and that's how you
know it's going to be anaerobic and more
[SPEAKER_02]: like the soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Coot goes, great, but why don't just
throw a handful of castings on there and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's just like the soil or put worms
in there and we know it's exactly how it
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: How it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like you can kind of over think
any of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as I understand it,
just like everybody else, you brew up a
[SPEAKER_02]: tea and let's say it's a bacterial tea or
fungal, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a nutrient tea and it's either
completely your molasses or fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically just biology at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pour it in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea is, is that they will go in there
and the bacteria is going to need food and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to start to eat some of the
organic material and start to release some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the inorganic nutrients that our plants
can't absorb until they're released
[SPEAKER_02]: through the cation exchange and they have
to be done through biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you dump all this biology on,
it just goes through and releases
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant can then get a release and they
get to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's this cycle where they
get to work on their own almost like an
[SPEAKER_02]: athlete and they get a protein shake or
they don't have to work so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean by that is normally we have to
like digest our food.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to chew it first.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to break it down in our stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have a protein shake,
it's just a quick boost of energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you can live off protein shakes,
I don't think that it's going to be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: idea to do it for every single meal all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a couple of them a day, maybe one a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much like that, I feel like if you
were trying to grow hydroponically with no
[SPEAKER_02]: soil media and just use compost teas,
you would quickly see its limitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have a good foundation,
I think that just biology is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to overdo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it goes in there and creates
these booms, one of the thought processes
[SPEAKER_02]: is if we're not adding more nutrients at
some point, are we just speeding up the
[SPEAKER_02]: release of our nutrients in our soil only
to cause problems in the future where we
[SPEAKER_02]: now are dependent on adding all these teas
all the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so which came first?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we create our own problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the answer to that is just having
a good mulch layer and using a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: above.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you, like you mentioned,
use a tea here or there, you notice a
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatic effect when you use them every
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seems to lose its dramatic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just to jump back to Coot for one
moment, I found a post from a while ago
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that he doesn't use any liming
source anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you still recommend a liming
source?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you talk to him,
he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that is because he uses worm
castings where he works that into his
[SPEAKER_02]: castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the castings are then having a lot of
calcium carbonate in them, which does
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his castings are probably fairly
neutral.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is when we talked to him
about our official Coot mix, he very much
[SPEAKER_02]: said that keeping the oyster shell flower
in there was acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that is we don't use as much
castings in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our new recipe, we're adding some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing is he does use
the calcium carbonate in the form of the
[SPEAKER_02]: crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's another form where you get
the calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the gypsum that we use is the
calcium sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think most people consider the
liming agent to be the calcium carbonate
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what lime is considered to
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he still does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it can be interpreted in many
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coot has a thousand conversations about
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure he said many times, sure,
you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you don't need to use this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very much not the type of person that
would say you have to have anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Mountain Organics, I think,
would probably be the one that laid out
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual recipe through the like
alternating water, tea, water,
[SPEAKER_02]: top dress, kind of basic methodology,
the no-till thread revisited form that he
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That recipe just included some basalt and
no oyster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be the lime that people
were talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I talked to Coot, still
recommends using oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that depending on your
situation, they may not be needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel there's so much power in calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless of what Coot says, I really
like to have a lot of calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the conversation now is getting a
little more advanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're working with agronomists that
are actually looking at our soils for our
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp farms, we're starting to get more
insight and working with real
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals with degrees and finding out
that the water testing and the carbonate
[SPEAKER_02]: level there can actually affect the
desired input that we might use in our
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just think that consistently,
when we get back to it, depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: potting soil or agronomy, there's no
one-size-fits-all answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Coot's mix is a great
one-size-fits-all recipe, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: predicated on quality compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, there's no
one-size-fits-all for any of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on where you live.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned Mountain Organics,
and he's someone who's, in my eyes,
[SPEAKER_01]: very much popularized the use of these
tinctures, especially the ones he makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that there's anything disingenuous
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you used them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that they're going to
increase in popularity, the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you reckon on the issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a tough situation in the
sense that Coot has since told me he
[SPEAKER_02]: thinks they're complete bullies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullshit and a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I take what he says with a grain of
salt, because he has human relationships
[SPEAKER_02]: just like all of them that might play into
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did speak highly of them for a
short period of time, like a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: other products that he no longer does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know that he goes through these
learning curves, too, where he gets
[SPEAKER_02]: excited about something, we talk about it,
and it turns out it's just not what we
[SPEAKER_02]: thought it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's come since and said that these
glycerin tinctures are just a total waste
[SPEAKER_02]: of time, and that there's better ways to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm trying to stay out of the
middle of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have not really had a
relationship with these people for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but knowing them through the
internet for a long time, we've made some
[SPEAKER_02]: connections there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mountain Organics has done so much for
the community as far as helping them keep
[SPEAKER_02]: this really simple process to no-till
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he basically invented no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say he invented it,
but it's like we were all in the forums
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about recycling soil and working
towards no-till, but it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, he's the guy on the 15th cycle who's
just doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was sticking to that basic
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, there's a million
different tinctures that you gotta use now
[SPEAKER_02]: at all these different levels,
and we're not seeing any dramatic results
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that I feel like people are really
using right now is the wreath-a-nut
[SPEAKER_02]: tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But wreath-a-nut is by far way more
affordable to get and use on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Emulsifies oil and is so easy to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna release a couple different
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is just the powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna get it from Usha Neem
Resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like working with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, you can go buy it from her right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get back in the office next week,
we'll have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the whole seed, and it's
really quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grind it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just mix it in a little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have the exact ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of going crazy with it and
screening it out, you just let the dust
[SPEAKER_02]: settle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take about 15 milliliters of this saponin
water and put it in your neem oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it'll emulsify it per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's some really easy processes
that when I'm looking at recommending a
[SPEAKER_02]: product to a facility that has 1,000
plants in a greenhouse, I wanna make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that not only is it effective,
but it's cost effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the reason why I haven't
necessarily started recommending his
[SPEAKER_02]: products across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the original get-off-the-bottle
guy, and so we were always talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: this and getting out of the bottle,
and I feel like I'm backpedaling a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit by doing amino acids and these
microbial products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've since come to learn that there's a
place for all of these tools, and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: will not write off the glycerin tinctures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use aloe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use soap melt without putting it
through glycerin, and I don't see any real
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit to doing that, and I have used his
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ordered them from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also ordered the book on No-Till that
he offers at his website, and I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a good experience as far as
customer service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't used them, and behind the
scenes, I've had this conversation a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple times, but politically,
I try not to just go out there and talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about other products just because I don't
use them, and so when someone asks me
[SPEAKER_02]: point blank, though, I just don't think
that's the future of cannabis gardening at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's going to last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and so just to hit on saponins a bit
harder, they definitely seem to be a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of a trending topic and just the general
use of emulsifying properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's really something that'll
stick around, or it's maybe, I think last
[SPEAKER_01]: time we called it the trending non-purple
sulfur bacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You think it's good enough to hang around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's hung around forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing new, and it's just people get
excited about learning about these things
[SPEAKER_02]: as if it's new, and there's an IPM report
that I would really encourage listeners to
[SPEAKER_02]: go download.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quickest way I can tell you to do it
is through a Build A Soil link,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you don't have to get it through us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it through the tweetment
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that made the product like 40
years ago, he owns the patent on enzyme
[SPEAKER_02]: action on pests, and he's an entomologist
or an integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_02]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he has some background in this,
and he wrote an IPM report through Build A
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the product's tweetment,
there's a link in there for useful info,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you download it, it's an organic
IPM routine, and it goes through so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different processes, talking about all
this stuff, and it's all free.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things you'll find in there is
the saponins, and mixing in Cuejila
[SPEAKER_02]: extract, I can't say that word,
soap nut, and yucca, and we're just
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about yucca and soap nut now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an old report, and there's all
the books you'll find.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about the benefits of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now his story with the tweetment is that
he knew a lot of people that were farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: and they were all dying from cancer,
and he found out they were all applying a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of pesticides as the family way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all had to support the business,
and he noticed that he could just take the
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide out and just alternate different
surfactants and different levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: saponin and get really good results,
similarly to using these expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was almost as if they were being
sold bullshit, and he could just use these
[SPEAKER_02]: saponins and use these surfactants and use
different modes of action like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so full circle we come around and
we're talking about saponin as if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: magic, but it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look into it and there are so many
different types of saponin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even Google this string of words,
saponin as a plant growth stimulant,
[SPEAKER_02]: and see that there are results indicating
that saponin actually helps, and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking that it almost like creates a,
like as a surfactant, like a modality of
[SPEAKER_02]: travel for the microbes in the soil by
creating this level of viscosity in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fact that it has these fungal
properties of these, I mean, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be like meme gate, you know,
putting soap in your soil is not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: kill all the fungus, but it could have
some effects related to the biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're seeing positive effects watering
soap, not in saponin in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: let alone using it as part of foliar
sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I think that's why we're gonna see
it being talked about more is I think the
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits are undervalued at this point,
and so we're gonna start talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: using yucca and soap mat and stuff a lot
more because we see tremendous benefit,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in peat-based soils,
to keeping everything sponge-like,
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping the moisture even, and then on top
of that, the saponin itself, when you look
[SPEAKER_02]: into its structure, there are some
indications that it has some plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits, which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We jump over to aloe vera, which is,
you know, kind of like the step back from
[SPEAKER_01]: saponins in some regards.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think the difference in quality
affects the difference in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like what you're gonna get from the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've noticed at the lower end of
the spectrum, you can get like aloe vera
[SPEAKER_01]: powder, which just doesn't have any label
of the concentration, and then you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: the 100X, the 200X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the case that, you know,
like the higher the number in
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, the better?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does that number even refer to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like content of saponins or
salicylic acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it worth the money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they definitely get more expensive
as you move up the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'll tell you exactly what that
X's mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 200X is the most affordable because it
takes the smallest amount of that powder
[SPEAKER_02]: to create the most amount of actual aloe
vera liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so 200X, what that means,
specifically, is that 199 grams of water
[SPEAKER_02]: and one gram of this powder would create
200 grams of actual concentrate just like
[SPEAKER_02]: you get from the aloe vera plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that one gram to 199, or that 200X
concentrate, is half as strong if you get
[SPEAKER_02]: the 100X.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna take two grams, or it's gonna
only take one gram against 99 grams of
[SPEAKER_02]: water instead of one gram against 199.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's twice as effective when you get
200X, and I guarantee you it's not twice
[SPEAKER_02]: as much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get to the non-measured
levels, and you start to get all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really care about the aloe,
and it's a pain in the butt because
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we run into supply issues based
on the weather or seasonal or the demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spend 20, $30,000 at a time on aloe,
and it's scary, but it's a popular product
[SPEAKER_02]: for us because of how effective it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow your own aloe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just becomes a problem on scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sell a lot of it, but in this
shopping period where we had supply
[SPEAKER_02]: issues, one of the things we love about
our suppliers, they actually were willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to test the products we were gonna get
when they couldn't provide for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in testing, we found that these other
companies were guaranteeing inner aloe
[SPEAKER_02]: filet, but they were hitting markers for
non-inner aloe filet, and that means that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of lying in the industry,
and they were just squeezing it instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting it or whatever their shortcut was,
and it created a very adulterated product,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially on the chemical constituent
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much like everything else,
there's a lot of bullshit out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: and when you go to a company that's
providing all of the data behind it and
[SPEAKER_02]: can back it up, it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's worth paying for a product
that's actually what it is, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're having to go around growing it
yourself, which would obviously be the
[SPEAKER_02]: best way and most cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then from there, if you're gonna ship
it in, an ounce of 200X will go
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly further than an ounce of
unlabeled or 100X, and you're gonna
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are talking about the
use of plant ferments to increase terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I see getting flung around the
most is banana and mango ferments,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there seems to be a growing group of
people who really do think it increases
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant's terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's true, does it not imply that
there's some kind of hormone or chemical,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically in mangoes or bananas,
that are key in triggering increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it's all just too
anecdotal to give any credence to?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like stuff with sugars in it has
always come back to people thinking it
[SPEAKER_02]: increases flavor, and I'm sure there's
carbohydrate, there's some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: correlative data there, but I think from a
ferment level, you're getting that organic
[SPEAKER_02]: addition, and so if somebody's using
ferments and they weren't before,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that at some level, these ferments
do increase the terpene level there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about it that does help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just adding the organics to
maybe a system that otherwise wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have that, but the mango specifically and
the fruit ones, we've always talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: the benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were to go buy enzymes for
digestion, a lot of times they're based on
[SPEAKER_02]: these tropical fruits, because they have
extract like enzymes like papaya,
[SPEAKER_02]: and from papaya and other ones that are
very, very strong enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like maybe that's what's going
on, is we're getting some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial enzymes that are really
increasing the ability, and that is being,
[SPEAKER_02]: by secondary nature, increasing the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not the fact that it's just a mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you complicate it by the fact that
mangoes have already been told to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, there's murkeen or
something, or mercine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I always say all these words wrong
when you read them, and the same to
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually, you get these stories,
a lot of times they're relative,
[SPEAKER_02]: like mangoes are gonna increase your high,
mango fermented is gonna increase the THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can't help but to think maybe
there's a little bit of folklore there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like, just like you,
people that I respect and people that I
[SPEAKER_02]: know are saying these fruit ferments,
these are increasing their quality
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow, and so I'll probably do some
playing around with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have in the past, and it didn't really
make a noticeable enough difference,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'd be willing to admit that maybe I
was doing wrong, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, second last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel social media affects the
landscapes of kind of growers and their
[SPEAKER_01]: view on organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by this is I've noticed
that time and time again, people on both
[SPEAKER_01]: sides of the fence will point to very
specifically maybe one or two people who
[SPEAKER_01]: uses their style of growing to give like
huge credibility to their arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it's made me think is,
do you think it's gotten to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where it like muddies people's views on
which grow style is maybe the best for
[SPEAKER_01]: them or just the best in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems like, you know,
you can always find someone to validate
[SPEAKER_01]: your argument on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's tough too because what you
see on Instagram is not always what's
[SPEAKER_02]: real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start to meet a whole bunch
of growers, I mean even me, probably
[SPEAKER_02]: people probably think build a soil is some
crazy, you know, amazing grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the harvest I had last time was fine,
but I didn't even know the genetics we
[SPEAKER_02]: grew weren't that great, and I wish I
would have grown something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, it's not always this just like,
perfect grow and when you start to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: like these synthetic growers that have
crazy yields and tons of photos and always
[SPEAKER_02]: the newest genetic and they have a huge
social media following or you have this
[SPEAKER_02]: organic grower that's always updating and
people say that they've got the best
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the one thing is the same across
the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have good, dedicated gardeners
regardless of what their methodology is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, that's what it
takes is it's gonna take a lot of work and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna take dedication and discipline
and gardening and has forever been the
[SPEAKER_02]: teacher of man to get a lot of these
things put together in their life from
[SPEAKER_02]: having patience and plan and organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's constantly teaching me I'm trying
to get better in so many different areas
[SPEAKER_02]: of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can feel like, you know, there's so
much to work on in the garden and in other
[SPEAKER_02]: places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you want social media and you
start seeing everybody and all they show
[SPEAKER_02]: you is just like their Facebook,
them on vacation, the biggest bugs they've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts to become this kind of false
reality and so I like to highlight,
[SPEAKER_02]: see the thrips that we had in our tent and
us trying to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to highlight the bad stuff that
happens too so that people can kind of see
[SPEAKER_02]: that reality and I think the reality is no
matter what style of grow you do,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna go through learning curves,
problems, ups, downs.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it just made no sense to grow any
other way than organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when I wanted to eat that way,
I knew how the genes and the pesticides
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything were affecting not just our
grow but actually the soil and the earth
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a lot of other people,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on the fence, they don't care,
they don't have any education and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: just looking at what grows the best weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to grow organic, they want to
grow hydro with no other consequences to
[SPEAKER_02]: the planet earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then they start pointing at all
these different arguments on social media
[SPEAKER_02]: about what's gonna yield the best or what
does this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nine times out of 10, they're not
comparing the same genetics, same grow
[SPEAKER_02]: style, the same setup, the same lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so much is missed that it's so
important that you have somebody trusted,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can maybe level with and tell you
the truth or maybe a resource like the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast that can interview people that
have more experience, breeders,
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the most part, there's no product
that's gonna double your yield and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: no system that's gonna guarantee you any
sort of result.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all gonna come down to your ethics
and your work and your principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky last question for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could only pick one additive,
and I use the word additive because it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be like a dry additive, it could be
a liquid, it could be in a bottle,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be whatever, to use on top of
what you would consider to be a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: well-balanced soil, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be your aminos or even a big
handful of neem?
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you have a really well-balanced
soil, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I kind of want to say on a brand
new soil with most growers that start with
[SPEAKER_02]: our products, I feel like if they have at
the very minimal microbial product and an
[SPEAKER_02]: amino acid product, they're going to make
it through the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna do really good and they'll
have the best chance of doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like those two are kind of what
I would have.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had to just pick one of those,
I feel like if my soil was already really
[SPEAKER_02]: good, my biology should be awesome
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ability to bypass that limiting
factor with the amino acids and help them
[SPEAKER_02]: build with all the other stuff that's in
the soil, that'd probably be the one go-to
[SPEAKER_02]: additive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had to switch the question a
little bit and be what do-it-yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: item, could you just be the one thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like compost tea just beats them
all because it's so easy to make,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's cost-effective, you don't have to do
it for a couple of days, like labs and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But probably the amino acid powder,
that thriving stuff just really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any comments or shout-outs
you want to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got so many things coming down the
pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll do a couple basic updates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the complete no-till support kit
that if you're considering trying this,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you go to buildersoil.com and look at
the no-till bundle, it's every product
[SPEAKER_02]: from start to finish that you would need
and it's got free shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's soil there and there's the
support system, the mulch, the cover crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the entire thing is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so instead of you having to go pick
and choose and ask us what should I get,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, go to the no-till bundle,
it's like 281 bucks to your door,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has like 13, 14 products and you'll
have an answer to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got basic IPM, it's got additives
like we talked about, like the microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: and the amino acids, completely covers the
whole profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, an announcement that maybe
nobody knows about and I'd love for you to
[SPEAKER_02]: check out is forums.buildsoil.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created a forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be for us to keep a place to
answer questions and actually keep it up
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of doing it where we have to
answer the same question over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also want to do a lot of these
side-by-side tests, document it all,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so if you check out forums.buildsoil
.com, it's just getting up and running.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need your help to build the community
and to get it more exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have better conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out and then I'd like to give a
shout out to all of our customers and just
[SPEAKER_02]: say thanks if you listen all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you're a total dedicated
no-till grower and that this stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: interests you as much as it does us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we couldn't do it without you,
we really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love when you call in, ask us
questions, when you email us or Facebook
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes us feel like we have a purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our employees, we've got sometimes up
to 15 employees that all get to work just
[SPEAKER_02]: because of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that'd be the shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a big thank you to Jeremy from Build
Soil for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you're now our first veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be sure to check out the forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not that active yet, but over the
next couple of weeks, we're going to put a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of effort over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be cool to see you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate you taking the time to
interview me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you have it, my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big thank you again, Jeremy,
for taking the time to sit down and chat
[SPEAKER_01]: with us for the second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure everyone to check out the
forums, check out Build Soil, all the new
[SPEAKER_01]: products they're offering.
[SPEAKER_01]: A huge thank you to our two show sponsors,
420 Australia and OGS, who sponsor the
[SPEAKER_01]: store immensely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're incredibly grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as our Patreon fans, who have been
the driving force behind a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: extra content recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone, big thank you to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: La la la la la la.
La la la la la.
La la la la la la.
