[SPEAKER_00]: Well well well welcome back my friends for
the epic part two with the humble hero
[SPEAKER_00]: Frida extraordinaire Caleb of CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always you're joined by your boy Heavy
Days here from the Upside Down Library and
[SPEAKER_00]: on this one we want to give a massive
shout out to our incredible sponsors who
[SPEAKER_00]: helped make the show happen as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds here now, the number one seed bank
in the industry, a guarantee not just on
[SPEAKER_00]: germination, on satisfaction, meaning at
the end of the growth if you're not happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll send you something to make it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they offer this is because
they only stock the highest quality
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they know you're gonna be
stoked at the end of a growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just worry about wasting your money,
worry about wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guarantee on satisfaction means you
don't need to be worried about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A massive shout out to Copert Biological.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are the world leaders in
sustainable biocontrol solutions to crop
[SPEAKER_00]: pests and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're battling spider mites check out
Copert's new Spidex Vital Plus sachets.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are new persimilus breeding sachets
that release predatory mites into your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop continually over a period of several
weeks providing sustained spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't have to spread carrier
material into your garden just to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce some predator mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hang the sachets in the crop,
let the persimilus walk out and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me guys, you don't have to go up
against a spider mite infestation without
[SPEAKER_00]: Spidex Vital Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are truly the best predators on the
market, the best in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you try it once, you'll see the
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulse sensors, you know them, you love
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably already got a pulse unit in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it helps you track all of the
hidden variables that you may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: consciously thinking about on the day to
day level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through fine tuning these parameters
you can get a bigger yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: More turks, more flavour, more resin,
more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: God what can't it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're thinking of running a
single tent, a single room, a multi-state
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get serious guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a pulse sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given they've just recently introduced
the Pulse Hub, no better time to get on
[SPEAKER_00]: board to be able to fully integrate all of
your units into one central localised hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive shout out to Pulse Sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love and appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

[SPEAKER_00]: And on this episode today, we have the
Humboldt Heroes, the head honcho of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pirates of the Emerald Triangle,
the Strain Historia and Breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraordinaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: A massive welcome and thank you to Caleb
of CSI Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to talk all things breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: His recent work with the F1 Durban.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upcoming projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: How he's able to make all the incredible
lines he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without further delay, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to loop back, you know, we were
talking about the Kush 4 and its relation
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about another Hindu Kush that's
been very popular for you, the Purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about this one
because there's now a number of Hindu
[SPEAKER_00]: Kushes, Purple Hindu Kushes, specifically
that go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people like,
is this the Jäger one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a different one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us any insights into the
Purple Hindu Kush you use that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jäger cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Purple Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Purple Hindu Kush I have is the one
that was made popular in southern Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: and it sources back to Millerville Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: In southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to them, you know,
they got, you know, some seeds of Hindu
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush, grew them out and there was a Purple
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple different variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what entirely the whole story
is, but one story was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they took a male from those seeds and
crossed it to the Purple Hindu and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how they made Jäger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, a further,
you know, breeding of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another, I don't know,
I don't know if it's a story or if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just my impression, but it almost seems
like the Jäger could just be a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a hermaphrodite S1 seed from the
Purple Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, you know, and then there's a
few stories of where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what that Hindu Kush exactly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it even ties back to like
an Amsterdam Hindu Kush or if it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, something entirely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But supposedly the seeds came from this
pharmacy or I think it was the pharmacy in
[SPEAKER_01]: like Los Angeles, somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was extremely popular in Southern
Oregon for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I went up to Oregon,
I would buy some of the finished flour and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the dispensaries, because it has that
similar, that similar black licorice,
[SPEAKER_01]: anise, turp, you know, like Mendo Purple
S1s do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I kind of liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, just to clarify, which of the
two plants do you favor, the Jäger or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Hindu?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Jäger better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more refined.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the Purple Hindu seems a little
broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like when you grow the Mendo
Purple cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a Mendo Purple S1 side by side,
you know, they're extremely similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then a lot of times the S1s will like
refine, you know, certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't be so broad, you know,
with their turf profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you, you know, you sort of alluded
to it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a bit of a soft spot for the
licorice turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I love it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's really
underrepresented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I talk a lot about with,
you know, like, you know, my buddy Matt,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not so dog is how the Mendo Purple
S1s, this is a total tangent, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's like a recessive in there that
is some of the strongest roadkill skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk that I've found anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's these little runty, like
ABC-esque runty, these little runty
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just reek of just skunk spray,
as close as I've really found,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they smell like spray,
whereas, you know, the sterling skunk I
[SPEAKER_01]: mess around with, that's more of,
you know, the skunk got hit, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a day or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: A week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this stuff is almost spray status
because it's so pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But... Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically answered the question for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to clarify, because it was one of
the listeners, they said, I've grown a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of your Mendo perps hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all been wicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been kind of uniquely surprised
by each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that skunk one you just mentioned the
most surprising thing you found in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have you found other equally weirdly
diverse virgin stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite, favorite lines to
play with, or S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, S1, you know, all that
stuff, you know, will show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't show up in the F1 hybrid,
it'll show up in F2, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's so much variation as far as,
you know, terpene profiles and just
[SPEAKER_01]: variety in that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one that was like a chocolate coffee
spice, you know, and then there's tons
[SPEAKER_01]: that are just super, super some of the
fruitiest stuff you've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then there's there's hashy
nog shampoo ones and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: blackberry ones and grapey ones and the
skunky ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's always fun to grow
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never expect like a bubba type
plant by the sounds of it in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plant was weird, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was way different than the norm
as far as most of the MPS ones go,
[SPEAKER_01]: but definitely unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you touched on it,
the sterling skunk, you know, shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, rest in pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ochie, we're all grateful that he passed
that one on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I chatted with Bodhi in December,
when I was in the States, I met up with
[SPEAKER_00]: him for dinner and he was like,
I was like, is it the real deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, yeah, it's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the sterling
skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, you know, the ones I released,
I put a warning on because I would not
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend these to be grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely can be some of the worst
hermaphrodites inside, but outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: zero hermaphrodites, which is par for the
course of how things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's definitely a line that
needs to be worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, because when I reproduced
them, did my open pollination,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are ones that were just,
you know, rock solid, just skunky as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made your eyes water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's a percentage game
again, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of them are, you know,
just variations of, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as, as, as a standalone plant,
it's, it's definitely not going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: ticket, you know, produce, you know,
big fat chunky nugs or this, that other,
[SPEAKER_01]: it definitely is a building block to
hopefully something better, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I was going to ask, you know,
what would you pair it with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think you would pair it with
that would help it to be what the public
[SPEAKER_00]: are in search of?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I kind of want to pair it with a
few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just to kind of start with,
I'd kind of like to work like some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky deep chunks in there, you know,
to help, you know, the plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to also maybe mix in the
Christmas bud I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has some strong skunky turps as well
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has like some super, you know,
pungency as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, if, you know,
I was able to get something, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: more so what I was looking for,
you know, to hybridize something like that
[SPEAKER_01]: with like a Chem D or something that
already has, you know, a nice base and the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you couldn't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like, just to confirm those ones
you were saying, you know, where it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: makes your eyes water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's the roadkill smell
that people are searching of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think the thing that people in
their minds are looking for, it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not like as real as what they think
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's never going to be like an actual
dead skunk, but this is pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think people have different things
they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are looking for this roadkill
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a muskier smell, whereas like a
skunk spray smell is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, blinds your eyes,
you know, makes them water, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: makes your lungs bleed, you know,
it's potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want from my roadkill,
you know, cause you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when you first hit that skunk dead
on no offense skunk, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, the, the, the few day old
road, roadkill is still pretty okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want that fresh, fresh, but I don't
know if it translates into dry weed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think maybe like whatever terpenes
are involved, you know, the trendy word
[SPEAKER_00]: thiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that they, they just too
volatile and you lose it really quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think back in the day,
everybody was selling wet weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your, your, your terps are still
like super strong with that wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then as soon as it's dry, you know,
it's gone, you know, with a lot of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, turps and thiles and all that
kind of stuff, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the stuff we're looking
for is, is too volatile to stick in a bag
[SPEAKER_01]: for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I wanted to ask you, cause we,
we mentioned Bodie and in relation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sterling skunk, I noticed on the website,
you got the mango Bichet and it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: been one that's been interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I remember Bodie made an offhand
comment years ago and he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's like the blue dream of South
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never, never quite understood what
he meant by that, but I've tried some
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and it's nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I mean, I've, I've, I've run it a
few times now and that's not, that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's like saying it's a basic
beginner plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a, it's a beginner sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but a long one, it, it, it takes just
as long as a, as the Burmese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like the mango BJ, but,
uh, there's something about the Burmese
[SPEAKER_01]: like plant itself that, uh, I'm really
drawn towards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereas the, the, the mango BJ,
yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: beginner plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's a good one though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and is the effect like super uplifting
or it's more in like the mild uplifting
[SPEAKER_00]: category?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm not a,
uh, I wouldn't say I'm a great sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: aficionado quite yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been buried in Indica my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, uh, get back to me in a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, I'll come test all your sativa
hybrids for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, just the pure sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought it snuck in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll share that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll share.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the fan submitted questions was
people had noticed that there were some
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5 Hayes hybrids sneaking into the
lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about the cut
you've been working with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking like dog shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they must be talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's had a big resurgence and you
know, not so has been pushing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: rightly good reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that, that, that's one, uh,
I think I, well, and the Chem 1,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that, that, that definitely,
you know, I think falls kind of into that
[SPEAKER_01]: category a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as, as any, uh, other NL5 Hayes
hybrids, uh, those, those I'm not at
[SPEAKER_01]: liberty to discuss right quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep our eyes open and ears
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, you know, sometimes the politics
out there are strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually impressed you have been able
to navigate the politics of it all
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, you, you do work with a
lot of different strains and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: lends itself to people getting butt hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, how do you navigate that space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's just about like,
when you do a project, as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it with integrity, like people can't
really get too upset or like, how do you,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would be your general advice?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, I wouldn't say I navigate very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody gets butt hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you want a list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the S1s you've made and those
are all the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only people who are about hurt are,
you know, uh, the clones I've,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've personally held for 25 years or so,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, yeah, there's no, there's no easy
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, honestly, uh, most of the
people who are about hurt, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to name names, but most of them didn't
have anything to do with creating breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything, you know, the, the,
these cuts that they're all about hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you know, and, you know,
a lot of times people, I'll, I'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll research stuff before I release
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, some, something will have
like, you know, five different companies
[SPEAKER_01]: making the same seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, well, they can't get butt
hurt at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're butt hurt at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of people, you know,
and I could tell you many stories on the
[SPEAKER_01]: topic, but you know, I'll leave that one
be for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's, um, it's, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely get it, you know,
because I feel like the landscape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: community is ever-changing and,
you know, how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause if we look at the
commercial scene at the moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most biggest and most popular
companies like Doja, like DEO Farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys who are like, you know,
making millions and millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: off selling, you know, quote Cali packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the guys who are lauded among
the heady community, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, cause they're, they're not like a
breeders breeders, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel the scene is progressing
in terms of that landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think is going to be the
trajectory going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those are good questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I gotta admit, uh, I, I tend to
like, stay in my little Humboldt County
[SPEAKER_01]: hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I mean, my, my long-term goal,
you know, is, um, I'm hoping, looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a couple of dispensaries up here,
a nursery, uh, you know, a pretty nice
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding lab or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then grow my own flower and
basically, you know, be vertically
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated and just, you know,
do everything myself, but on a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very small manageable scale that I can
have fun with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's my long short-term goal,
you know, three, four or five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so as far as, you know, outside of my
little tiny bubble here, um, I don't pay a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of attention to it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And golly, I'm sure a lot of people are
really excited to hear that that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got on the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it would be based in
like Northern California Mendocino type
[SPEAKER_00]: area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've, I've already, um, I'm already
working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, um, my, my buildings and,
uh, working on the licenses and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, getting, hopefully getting stuff
built out over the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and then as soon as I'm open
and, you know, good for all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, anybody who wants to,
you know, come through and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: visit, I'll, I'll, I'll have the spot to
visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone will put their hands up
to be guinea pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you need tested, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really, really cool because
I feel like a lot of people have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: doom and gloom forecast for the industry
going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really refreshing to hear that
people like yourself, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to sound too dramatic,
but it's, it's almost like the antidote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, don't, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't think there's going to be
much money in it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have a tough time just
surviving, but as long as I'm able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: what I like to do, I think that's all that
I really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to ask you a few questions about
creating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, part of these are my questions,
part of them are the listeners submitted
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, but the first one I wanted to
ask is how long do you let seeds mature on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just let it go the length it would
normally go or do you like really push it
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to get the most out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I generally, um, you know,
once the room is like fully pollinated,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't start counting down until the
room's fully pollinated or as pollinated
[SPEAKER_01]: as it's getting, and then I'll,
I'll leave the seeds on the plants for
[SPEAKER_01]: between six and eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just to make sure they're,
you know, nice and solidly ripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, um, I've seen other people,
you know, they're, they're, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: selling seeds, you know, next day,
as soon as it's down, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I try to dry it, dry my seeds for a
couple of weeks usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, then they get, you know,
sorted and sifted and blown and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go in the fridge for ideally
no less than a couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but usually I don't like, you know,
taking them out of the fridge for at least
[SPEAKER_01]: a month, you know, before, you know,
I start messing with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, that's, that's pretty much
the average right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and when they're on the plants,
are you treating them as if they're like a
[SPEAKER_00]: sensei crop or are you like really pushing
them with nutrients and like not trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid a fade and just trying to keep it
stocked up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely, uh, uh, keep, uh,
pushing them with nitro and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other, other, uh, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm, I'm not trying to flush them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, you know, I'm trying to, you know,
just keep feeding those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow-up, I myself have been
wondering, what do you do with your,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the material that's left over after
you've shucked the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of heads there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you try to like make a concentrate or
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, I've had other people say,
oh, it's usually not the greatest material
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to do anything with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do with it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to do something because,
you know, I like, I don't like throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like reusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I don't like being wasteful,
you know, if I can help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, to be honest,
I'll end up with, you know, hundreds and
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of pounds of that stuff all
stored up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, realize I'm not doing
anything with it and take to the dump or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, the green waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it last time I took it to the
green waste and it became some compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one of those little purple pro units
and, um, I tested some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it came out like seven or 8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely not like the same by
any stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I think anyone thought so,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you like your purple pro?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so obviously I saw the,
the discussion, um, about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you and Matt not so met up and,
um, you know, the, the gist I got was that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys weren't really convinced about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for me, you know, I, I tested it a
lot and I think it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my overall summary would be that I
feel like it really confirmed,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just confirms what you already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you, you, you test a plant
that's your favorite plant and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not like a chem 91, but like a
plant where you're pretty confident it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sure enough, it will be the
most potent that you get tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I definitely thought was a
hurdle was that, um, you have to do a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of tests and then take the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I thought that from a consumer
point of view, people really want
[SPEAKER_00]: something where you just put something in,
you hit the button and then you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate answer straight away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's something that can be
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to know how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's definitely not perfect yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm still a little suspicious,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like, I mean, that's the thing it's
working on an algorithm, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they, they provide the paper so
you can read how they develop the
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I trust that part of it, but it seems
like there's a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I've been discussing it with some
other listeners who have one as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all seem to come to the conclusion that
there needs to be a far more standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: way in which you load it in, because we've
all noticed if you just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you fill it with some herb and you do the
test, if you pull that same little puck
[SPEAKER_00]: out and just like break it up and then
repack it back in so that it's all the
[SPEAKER_00]: particles have been moved around,
you can get variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like it needs to be a very
standardized way to test it so that when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you what I got, it's the same
as what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe I need to use it a little
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of stuff I bought at a
bunch of Oregon, Southern Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries, and they got their numbers
on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was planning to test them here pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it would be cool to see like the
incorporation of it into a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program, because that was what they really
pitched to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, the theory sounds
solid where they were saying you can test
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like basically, apparently as soon as you
get like a resin on the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, you can test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the numbers are going to be
like less than 1%, but they'll still vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they seem to suggest when I was
interviewing them that the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: tests higher earlier will be the stuff
that tests higher later as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were basically saying,
you can start thinning plants out in like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, week four, week five,
just based on those preliminary numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that would be interesting
for someone like you, who, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going through 500 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonetheless, just as a follow on from what
we were talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're talking about this
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the listeners was specifically keen
to know, would you ever consider releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I have my, you know, my vertical
integration all going, my main focus would
[SPEAKER_01]: be, I think a lot of people don't want to,
you know, uh, you know, select their own,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, seed seed plants that they don't
want to, you know, grow out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and make their own selections,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things, you know,
I definitely would be doing is growing out
[SPEAKER_01]: these populations, making selections,
choosing plants, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for indoor grow outdoor grow, you know,
a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to, you know, make some ABC
selections types that people can grow on
[SPEAKER_01]: their front yards or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just be like, haha, you know,
but, you know, make them selected plants
[SPEAKER_01]: so people don't have to root through a
hundred or 200 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, that might not be the best
to find good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that, that's kind of where
I'd be heading with, with all that for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and do you think generally speaking,
the future of growing is going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: in clones or you think it'll always be
seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they all have their places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, you know, clones,
clones can be reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, see seeds are easy and
also seeds, you know, pop them in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fridge, pop them in your freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good for 10 or 20 years,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a bit of a time bolt in that
sense, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you, what do you think
would have a better chance of success?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you got a clone and you want to
improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're like, I've got this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's one or two things I can
acknowledge are not perfect and would be
[SPEAKER_00]: better if they're maybe, you know,
a bit bigger yield, better structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you would be best to S1 it
and run through like a hundred females and
[SPEAKER_00]: just try to find a plant or two that has
those improved traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think you would be better to
just try to make some hybrids with a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, like a male that, you know,
maybe generally speaking, that line of the
[SPEAKER_00]: male has like better structure and then
you just try to select a plant that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly leaning to the mom with a few
better traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'd, I'd lean towards,
you know, S1ing it, running, running a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe ideally, you know,
finding a, like an out-cross type that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't push anything forward and,
or much of anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like maybe structure or whatever,
but not like terpenes or potency or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, make a hybrid that,
you know, takes the best qualities of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, and then, you know,
make some fairly stable seed, seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess as an extension of that,
let's say, let's say we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the TK, cause I know you've done a lot of
work with the S1s of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: TK generally speaking, you know,
it's, it's got a bit of stretch to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly not like a squat Indica
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think if you hunted through enough
S1s, you could find something that is like
[SPEAKER_00]: quite squat or there's like a limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if the plant you're working with is
very stretchy, like you're going to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of struggle to find a plant inside of it
that is like the same thing, but on a
[SPEAKER_00]: short body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With TK, I didn't really find anything
that was, you know, squat or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: stumpy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of, you know, just plants you
wouldn't really want to keep at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think they were just squat and
stumpy because it was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were just, you know,
you know, inbred type runs, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're going to get with any S1 types,
you know, you're always going to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: population of a recess of just garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the garbage is good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not talking about the garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
TK5750?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've seen it popping up a lot and
I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got my ears peaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, 5150, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 5150,
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprouted a bunch of, the first time I
ran a bunch of TK S1 seeds, I sprouted a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of them and then my buddy comes
through and he's like, I need some plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm like, well, I got all these seeds
and, you know, you could have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: seed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he ended up running all these TK S1s
and I just, you know, sprouted,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, another hundred, you know,
the next go around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I went over and, you know,
checked out his run of them, my favorites
[SPEAKER_01]: were number seven, number 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number 50 and number 51.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the seven was like a white,
you know, the white, it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it looked like the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the 14 looked like a green Girl
Scout cookie plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the 50 and 51, they were both OG
Kush types, you know, TK types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, chunky frosty, just,
you know, really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I, I got samples of,
you know, those four, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the four favorites from his, his run and
took them home and smoked the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, smoked them all, smoked the 51.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, decent, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I smoked the 50 and that, that,
that one made, every time I smoked it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it made me der, like a little,
little crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm, I'm pretty good with
my smoke, you know, most of the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: other people smoked it and they couldn't
function because, you know, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, it, you know, it's the number 50,
but I started calling it the 51 50 because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the 50 and the 51 that were my
prime selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyways, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ended up keeping the cut and, you know,
working with it and it breeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeds pretty okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause I was going to ask you,
are you really hunting like 6,000 plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw 51 50, I was like, fuck,
he's going next level now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one I kept from my next run,
which was another hundred and something or
[SPEAKER_01]: so was the 677, but that actually stood
for bed six number 77.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, it wasn't from another 700
plant run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five one five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone keep your eye out for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a quick follow up,
I might've missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have the same flavor profile as
the TK or is it like different in a way?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's pretty close to a traditional
TK, nothing too, too, too impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, uh, you know, TK, you know,
it's high as what it is, but this one,
[SPEAKER_01]: just every time I smoked it, it just
seemed to, you know, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: do the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, just, you know, while we're on
the topic of the TK, do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on, you know, Marty from TK
origins, you know, has come out and said
[SPEAKER_00]: what he said about the origin and the,
you know, the speculation that it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of Hindu by Hindu roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, whatever the Emerald
triangle strain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on all of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, that's a, that's a tough one
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, um, yeah, uh, uh, that,
that, that, that's a good discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, the, the story has been
variable since the start and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: Marty, uh, he, he posted, uh, on icy mag
years and years ago, um, the same story,
[SPEAKER_01]: but different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the story has been a bit flexible
for probably the better part of the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years, give or take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sort of yet to be convinced?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a, there's a good bit of
truth to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a better way to phrase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good bit of truth to it,
but I think some of the details might not
[SPEAKER_01]: be a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, I'm, I'm cool with,
uh, Alec, you know, who, who's,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's the one who, you know, uh,
found the OG Kush, um, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sprouted that seed and that the seed he
sprouted does tie back in to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Marty and that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot of truth to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I think some of the details,
um, I just, I don't know if some things
[SPEAKER_01]: that shouldn't be solid are being made
solid now, you know, like it was a mystery
[SPEAKER_01]: of what it could be, but now it's,
we know exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it changes that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to, uh, um, find out who the
guy Marty worked for back when he was a
[SPEAKER_01]: kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause Marty was just a water boy back
in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I've had plenty of water boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never was a water boy, except for my own
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, uh, I'd, I'd love to find out
who, you know, he was growing for,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause obviously they should know what that
Emerald Triangle was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, Marty thought it came from
Washington, Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um, I mean, the Emerald Triangle
is, you know, Humboldt, Mendo and Trinity
[SPEAKER_01]: County, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's interesting, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, could you just in isolation,
could you believe the general formula of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Hindu cross to a Hindu type plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think, oh, that does,
like what you based on what you've seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not really what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be, it could be a Hindu,
Hindu Kush type hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when my buddy grew out, uh,
all those, uh, TKS one seeds, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: his room was a little over nitroed,
but a little too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows in beds just like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and his room was cold, probably
colder, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his, his TKS one plants looked
Jurassic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm like, how did nothing in that
room look like OG Kush or triangle Kush at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, then, uh, um, cause I think it
was a, like a winter spring run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably a winter run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he took clones of all those
plants and did another run, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the clones and the whole room,
it was like, you know, 50 or so different,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, S one S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but from clone, you know, and it all
looks like triangle Kush or OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole, whole room, you know,
from, from the clone room, but from seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it looked Jurassic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just old school Hindu Kush type,
you know, plants just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about since the Hindu Kush,
maybe, maybe not, but definitely some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some version of Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a bit of an unrelated question,
which I love to ask all of the breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: who are a bit prolific, what's your advice
for someone who's looking to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding game and do their own thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I mentioned earlier,
there seems to be a growing sentiment that
[SPEAKER_00]: people feel like it's hard to
differentiate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think the majority of
people who get into breeding, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it for passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a part of them that doesn't
want to be perceived as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just producing a run of the mill thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like everyone else, you know,
everyone would like to produce something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's unique and it's going to stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any advice for how someone
might be able to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, uh, just recommend that
somebody, you know, find something they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they really like, and just focus on,
you know, like one or two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, uh, um, you know, for example,
the way I do things, uh, it, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not entirely fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, you know, I think, uh,
I am going to, you know, eventually here
[SPEAKER_01]: be changing to, you know, just focusing
on, you know, a couple of few things and
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, really, really try to,
you know, you know, work those things
[SPEAKER_01]: until they're just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus, you know, all kinds of different
things, eh, you know, it gets watered
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you're focused on something
that just, you know, is really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you're really passionate about that,
that, that would be, that would,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would probably be the best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you're passionate about
something, chances are other people will
[SPEAKER_00]: be passionate about it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even just from the perspective of if
you're passionate, about it, people would
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, Oh, like it must have something
to offer if that's what you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of the new favorite questions I've
been asking a lot of people is without
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to know anything about the
individual, cause obviously you'd prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: to know specifics, but without being able
to know anything about the individual,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you could only recommend one pack as
just something where you think majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to be pretty happy with
what they find inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be your go-to sort of offering
for the general public?
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, uh, uh, there's, there's,
there's a, there's a few, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I think, uh, anything, uh,
from the big bad wolves, those are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of tried and true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, shout out to not so for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, his headband times Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that one, I don't think anybody's
found, found a pack that hasn't had all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of gold in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, um, I mean, both the Chem D
and the headband read really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, those ones are pretty tried and
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's music to my ears because I,
as soon as I got my hands on a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: that Chem D headband, I put it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, you know, you, you sort of touched
on it and a lot of people are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: super hyped for the fact that,
uh, you have some fun collabs coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some with not so some with Matt,
are you able to touch on some of the finer
[SPEAKER_00]: points?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know specifically one of the fans was
keen to hear a bit about the upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: Giesel project or Giesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, uh, you know, here's hoping
to, it reverses it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I emphasize that pretty much always,
you know, uh, total, total tangent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I just recently reversed a cherry
pie and I figured that one, that one was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, kick back, relax,
watch the pollen fly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, cherry pie is a herm,
you know, it's, it's going to be easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, complete fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, the, the run is drying right now,
but if I got 1% seed, yeah, I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, you know, I don't, I don't count
chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I try not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I do, I get slapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I've got to ask what
sort of plants would you be most
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in pairing cherry pie with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I definitely, you know,
wanted, I always want S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my main goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I do a reversal, cause I like
digging through the S ones and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling, pulling plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, um, I, I had a bed full of
granite purple, uh, purple Urkel,
[SPEAKER_01]: grape ape, uh, some of the Urkel S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, uh, I had the, you know,
the opposite end of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, you know, OGs, you know,
uh, TKs, sour Ds, you know, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and then, you know,
a few, few in-betweeners, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got, you got me thinking now when you
do these reversals, is it all very ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: methodical in terms of what females go in
the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it the case that because you've got
so much going on, it's sort of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've always got a good rotation of moms
and you just sort of chuck in what's ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's methodical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I try to do, uh, I, I try to,
you know, do multiple different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pairings, like pair of things
that are like kind pair of things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite kind, you know, and then,
you know, pair of things that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that I just think might,
might be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, I overdo it on, on clone
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, in an average month,
I'll probably, you know, end up taking,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, a couple thousand clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I always have, or usually
have a really broad pool to select what I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to put into these rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I usually get what I want in my
rooms, not always, but usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you, you open the flood gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like how on earth, like,
what's your clone tech?
[SPEAKER_00]: How on earth do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, uh, just, just plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, I use, uh, like big plugs,
um, you know, 50 per tray, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like two inch plugs, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, um, and that, that, that allows
me time because, you know, the plugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, you know, the clones can sit in
those plugs for, you know, three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four, five, you know, six weeks,
you know, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, you know, I'm able to have,
you know, clones on deck for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause if you're feeding, you know,
five different rooms, you're always trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, you need that stuff ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have like a go to rooting
stimulus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just variable?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use basic old clone X, um,
liquid, you know, uh, and, and dip and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, neither of those is organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my cloning is not organic folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we loop back, you know, you
mentioned that you're trying to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of plants do you think would
pair really well with the diesel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, you know, definitely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, um, diesels, you know,
they'll kind of compound, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody does that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that, you know, are, um,
you know, a little, a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: mystery definitely would like to have some
hash plants in there, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some pucks, some HP 13, that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I tend to with, so like with
diesel, you know, I would generally tend
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay away from fruity stuff,
you know, like cherry AKs, strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cough, you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I don't know if diesel would be
the greatest thing to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: slap against Girl Scout cookies or wedding
cake or fritters or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't, I don't, I don't think
Skittles would be in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that might just get weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it sort of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you're saying it out loud,
I'm like, yeah, I get the impression it
[SPEAKER_00]: would like dominate them and, and like
sort of muddle it a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, I definitely try for,
for like kinds, but then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like, you know, uh, some of the
hash plants mixed with it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they definitely can, you know,
make something decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if we, I mean, in my mind,
I sort of associated the, the diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: collab with Matt and I've heard you may be
doing a headband collab with not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, uh, well, I mean, uh, it might be a
different type of collab of sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, we're, we're, we're still
working out the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know everyone's really,
really, really keen to, to see that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that take off, you know, cause I mean,
I'd be interested to hear, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: compare that headband the LA Kush to other
headbands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it different?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, not so his headband is like a
strong, uh, like diesel plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, other, other headbands, you know,
uh, there's, there's multiple OG Kush type
[SPEAKER_01]: headbands.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the 56 day headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Loompa's headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those are, you know, just straight
up OG Kush types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then there's, uh, the 707 headband,
which was like a OG sour diesel type,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, that was popular around
here, you know, like 15 years ago or
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, um, not so his headband is,
is really similar, uh, to this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this cut that circulated around,
um, like, I don't know, 15, 15 to 18 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, multiple people, uh, had this cut
as like a chem dog 91, but it was a sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel type plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, doctor of archive,
you know, got, got this plant as chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I think Loompa, Loompa got
it as chem 91 too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was these diesel plants,
like a sour diesel type plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, uh, not so his headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how they, they got named
as chem dogs or headbands or what.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a little strange, a little
strange, but good quality plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, do you know, is that the,
uh, the, the JB chem 91 cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The JB, uh, um, I, I got that,
that cut, uh, I don't know, maybe 15 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the JB, the JB was like, uh,
I actually ran the JB next to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that other, that sour diesel type chem
91 cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the chem 91 was like this big
burly diesel plant, whereas the JB was
[SPEAKER_01]: like this skinny little sad sister to
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just, just in my side by sides,
you know, one person's experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't have a whole lot of respect
for the JB.
[SPEAKER_01]: The JB.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I mean, it goes to show just the
sheer amount of cuts that are incorrectly
[SPEAKER_00]: named chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was, it was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, there's, there's tons of
chem 91s going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the, on the topic of purple strains,
I wanted to talk to you about the pink and
[SPEAKER_00]: perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it took place in between
now and our last chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't talk about it last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when you first started posting
about this, the first thing I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask was, what is it about this line that
really captivated you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it seems like you were really
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, it looks cool,
but you know, I can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you like about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pinks and perps kind of started it out
as a mystery for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was, I was touring my buddy,
uh, Shiva.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was touring his farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mendocino and he had made,
uh, this hybrid that was like dog's waltz,
[SPEAKER_01]: the purple dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was, you know, pretty popular
around here for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he had made a hybrid with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, what did he, oh, he,
he crossed it to Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had crossed a bunch of different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and everything else was just green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this dog's waltz, this, you know,
purple dog bud or purple dog, purple dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, every plant in his garden,
pretty much of that, that cross had dark
[SPEAKER_01]: purple, almost black flowers and pink
hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like bright fluorescent
pink or almost red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, all of these other
hybrids with the Afghani one are green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they probably didn't get any of this,
you know, purple and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pink hairs from the Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I've grown dogs waltz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown that, you know, purple dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff doesn't look anything like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't purple like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have, you know, pink hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I backtracked and our buddy Blaze,
he had made a hybrid, um, of this killer
[SPEAKER_01]: queen, uh, Mendo purple crossed to a
Hawaiian and that the Hawaiian had pink
[SPEAKER_01]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Mendo perps in that,
uh, you know, uh, pushes it's purple
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had actually made it F2 and he's
the one who had given the dog's waltz to
[SPEAKER_01]: Shiva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, you know, I think,
I think, I think you, uh, might have given
[SPEAKER_01]: them the wrong cut, you know, and,
uh, our, our buddy NCGA was the one who
[SPEAKER_01]: made the killer queen Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, we're, we're
backtracked all the way to like 2000,
[SPEAKER_01]: what three years on 2002.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but anyways, so I had to investigate
this all the way back and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: finally figured that it wasn't what it was
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, the, this totally
different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, you know, I liked it when I
saw it at its farm and he gave me a huge,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, container of seeds and I ran out
like 180 of them and made an open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination, made a bunch of selections,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ended up finding one of my
favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found in a few years, you know,
out of that, which is, uh, the sweet 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's she like?
[SPEAKER_01]: She, I mean, no two people, I brought her
to the party, uh, uh, that, that Matt
[SPEAKER_01]: threw in, uh, no two people could describe
her the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think she's like mango
pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people were saying like apple this,
um, some people said mango, some said
[SPEAKER_01]: pineapple, some said apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, no two people smelled,
smelled her the same, but she was like one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the few that was like a green one in
the whole bunch out of 180.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and full of seeds, you know,
after just sitting for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: months or whatever, just dry in cause I
kind of neglected the, the finish on that
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, she reeked and usually most things
don't smell, you know, when they've just
[SPEAKER_01]: been sitting forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she holds her terpenes really well,
which is, which is pretty rare,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, especially as strong as she was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, definitely one of my recent
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a really unique profile as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cause you don't hear a lot about
apple profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's also a very
underrepresented flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like the X 18 terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you, do you find that terpene
commonly in the X 18?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when, when I grew her,
yeah, it was, it was nice, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled like apple to me where I don't get
the apple from the sweet 16, but other
[SPEAKER_01]: people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you get more of the,
uh, the mango pineapple, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and do you feel like it's like a
hybrid sort of effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more Indica leaning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, she almost seems a little bit more of
a sativa effect to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think she might be like,
uh, a throwback to, uh, the killer queen,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a Cindy 99 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's like a G 13 Cindy 99,
but I mean, that's, that's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of generations past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I was thinking about, you also
mentioned the whole wire and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking maybe it's sort of coming from
both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's more higher on my list to
give a good run because I'm always keen on
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on that topic, you know,
you mentioned the, uh, the pink 16,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of your favorite in the past few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And earlier on in the episode,
you mentioned being really fond of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you a few questions about
it because I have had a few people message
[SPEAKER_00]: me and say, you know, is, is lemon party
lemon tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first question, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think, um, I think lemon party,
um, might be an S one possibly hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, either S one or hybrid of lemon
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it might've come from like
straight organics and, um, it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it's like a, a tall lanky plant,
at least it is for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tall lanky plant and it's,
it's like just as pungent as tangy,
[SPEAKER_01]: like just over the top, you know,
candy, just, you know, fruit, but more on
[SPEAKER_01]: the lemon, lemon turf profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, then, then lemon tree is like
the short, you know, stumpy Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: type plant, um, with just, you know,
super pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just strong, strong, like lemon oil
type turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm terrible at describing this kind of
stuff, but that's, that's kind of as close
[SPEAKER_01]: as I can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're both great plants,
but you know, quite, quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard from some of the,
some of the guys, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are real familiar with lemon tree is,
you know, you, you do get, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the, um, some of the lankier
sativa type plants coming out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there, there's a bit of mystery to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if, you know, cause,
uh, some of them say it might,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might, might've come from, uh,
Oregon and it could be like a old Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so in that case, which one do
you like more?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I kind of like lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that sort of makes sense in a lot
of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when you described it,
that sort of checks out a little more with
[SPEAKER_00]: the common lineage you hear, which is
like, it's meant to be what, like a sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel lemon skunk sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's definitely one of the most
pungent plants, um, I've come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you run it with 50 other
different hybrids and it's the only thing
[SPEAKER_01]: you can smell in the room, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a, a pack of yours of the,
um, the Melvin cross to the lemon party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, that one's going to be a
hitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that one could be very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what I was thinking, it should be
like citrus central, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just exploding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess the final question on
this one for me is, I guess in a sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lemon party S ones are essentially
lemon tree S twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the lemon party is like an S
one, you know, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you're one of the only people
who really gets into the S twos hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm, I'm a huge fan of them,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you offer any S threes at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't even offered any of my S you
know, legit S twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably have a few S twos, but you
know, um, they're not marketed as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as S twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I can't, you know, claim a hundred
percent that they're S twos, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and honestly, most people I don't
think would be extremely thrilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running out some S twos or S threes,
you know, or the very least S threes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of looking for that vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lack of vigor just might not be the
ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, while we're on the topic,
I, I don't think we asked it earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I definitely got to ask it because it
was submitted by three different fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the most interesting thing you've
ever seen come out of an S one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really just unexpected left of the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um, I think I posted pictures of it,
uh, years ago on, uh, on ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, I had this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think I posted pictures of it was
tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might've got to two inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was on his like 20th node.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a little blue, blue green
ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I had it for like six
months and it was like two inches tall at
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not the mutant most people would
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I tried flowering out,
it died.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not meant for this cruel world.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was, it was a sad little ball of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just reminded me of that incredible
photo that, uh, not so posted of that
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic plant in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a bit about that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was in a garden he was working
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, um, I mean, you know,
he's, he's way more familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was a huge debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never even ended up reading all the
comments cause they got a little too
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I mean, a lot of people,
you know, think that's a, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a virus or something, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just as likely that it's just a
genetic, you know, mutation as any virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, I, I've told me years
ago, you know, when, when, when Chem D
[SPEAKER_01]: first was, you know, getting into
circulation, he was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just a genetic, you know,
blah, blah, blah, and not know stank
[SPEAKER_01]: virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it, if something's a virus,
you kind of expect it to pass on
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they don't like pass on,
I think it's probably just a genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: something, something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, what's your verdict on
variegation, you know, cause there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: some people who are really adamant in
their belief that it's a form of a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other people are like,
no, I think it's just a trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it can be either or, you know,
I think, you know, if, if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's variegated and,
you know, it's in your rooms for X amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of years and then it passes on or it
passes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, obviously it's a virus, but I mean,
I don't take any more, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: time with a Chem D cut, you know,
you know, taking clones or any of that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's never passed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just leans, leans toward it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a, it's just a genetic trait,
you know, I mean, so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's been a while since we
chatted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although it's sort of old news,
we just can touch on it quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How have you been affected by Hoplite and
Viroid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, um, back in like 2011,
2012, I think it was, um, I, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gotten, you know, um, I was doing
some heavy trading with people and I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten a bunch of cuts from, you know,
jungle boys that, you know, before they
[SPEAKER_01]: were jungle boys and, you know,
a few other cats, I'll, I'll let them
[SPEAKER_01]: remain, remain nameless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I got just tons of this,
you know, these messed up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and, uh, I got the white fire,
uh, jungle boys, you know, five keeper
[SPEAKER_01]: plants of white fire, the 43, the 80,
the 28, you know, and I grew them out and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, who would ever keep these
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're complete garbage, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they all harm the, there's no frost,
you know, they look like crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have my, the rest of my
room looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyways, fast forward, found out,
you know, it was some kind of something,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they didn't figure out two years
later, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out, get rid of those fucking
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I quarantine everything,
you know, especially more so now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, ever since like 2014,
I'm like, uh-uh, you don't come in unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you got papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, uh, you know, uh, so,
uh, you know, I've, I've definitely had,
[SPEAKER_01]: had plants that, you know, were positive,
but they've always in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always quarantined them, knew they
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I either throw them away or,
you know, uh, um, or keep them segregated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I haven't had any, any HP,
uh, whatever, whatever, any of that virus
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in my room, probably a damn near a
decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it'll be like,
um, it'll be a virus that sort of just
[SPEAKER_00]: dies out eventually?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like when I talk to people,
a lot of people are like you and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I now know what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't feel like I've had it for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it'll, it'll die out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it'll be like the flu with
humans where it just, it just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: circulates around and it's always there,
but it's sort of in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to not, you know,
uh, keep it from not spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, just don't bring it in
your rooms, you know, and it's really easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, ever since I got rid of,
you know, um, all the plants that had it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, years ago, um, you know,
and it started doing protocol,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of not introducing stuff,
you know, straight into my rooms from
[SPEAKER_01]: strange gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I haven't had a problem with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think it's going to stay
around because a lot of people are sloppy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, I mean, I have plenty
of stories of bringing the wrong plant
[SPEAKER_01]: into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you about it because I've
been wondering for a while, the ruthless
[SPEAKER_00]: runs cuts, how is that different to normal
runs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it really connected to the RBL
posse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, um, I think I should just like,
um, you know, uh, keep quiet on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, RBL is gangster rappers,
so you, you probably don't want to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: them what their cut is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what, what I will say though is,
uh, for what it is, it's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, um, is one of the most stable
cuts, um, that I've S1ed and bred with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, uh, is very potent and passes the
potency on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's very uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, I have a hunch that it's an
S1 of something else and there might not
[SPEAKER_01]: be any Z in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, do you feel like runs really
expresses a ton of Z generally speaking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've felt like whenever I tried
runs, I was like, this is just gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, um, I, I have runs as well,
or just regular runs and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, there's plenty of Z in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I've just been having ruthless
runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially.
Essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, out of curiosity, why do you think
like, I've noticed that like the sherbet
[SPEAKER_00]: profile has really come back into
popularity and it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that creamy gelato sort of vibe seems to
be very popular with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any suspicions about why
that's come back around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's almost like it had its time in
the sun, then it got pushed out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way, but now it's back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously people like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good answer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: On that one, uh, um, uh, I've never
actually run the, the cookie fam sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always, uh, run the, the green
sherbert, which was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: real popular around humble Mendo,
all that, which is the one that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, seems like it's probably related
more directly to Skittles, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the sunset sherbert from cookie
fan, that's, that's the one that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, you know, more, more gelato
ask, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly the flavor profile I
think has been really popular recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got an interesting fan
submitted one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say this is all hypothetical,
but I suspect it relates to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they're saying, you know,
if you were to live in like a prohibited
[SPEAKER_00]: state and the market, there's no good
weed, you know, no one even really knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what OG is, what cookies is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably give them anything and
say it's OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was good weed, they'd be like
right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the question is, if you live in
such an area, what strains that you offer
[SPEAKER_00]: in seed form, would you say would be a
good thing where like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to give someone like a quality
end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be able to offer
something that's sort of not currently
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you offer to someone who's in
like an environment where it's just ample
[SPEAKER_00]: playing field to pump out some nice herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I always, I always
recommend the, the, the big bad wolves
[SPEAKER_01]: just because they got the potency,
you know, super strong, they stink and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, they've, they've got pretty
good yields too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, when I first ran the,
the one big bad wolf, I mean, if I had
[SPEAKER_01]: kept that, that cut, uh, I could,
I could be doing some four pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: lights right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we last spoke, have you changed your
mind on CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: You using CO2 at all or still not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, far too lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have there been any major changes to the
way in which you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you switched over to LEDs?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, far too cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, far too far too poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you rocking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just metal halides, HPS?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just still, uh, still same old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, DE's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaveta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaveta's in the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not too amped about upgrading to
anything in it anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, do you like, do we just need to G
up a sponsorship for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fozy, if you're listening,
send my man some LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, uh, when I, when I get back to,
you know, some flower production,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for my dispensary, then, then I'll be
buying some new equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, do you have a name in mind for
the facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm, I'm going to hold off and touch
on that next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How that'd be.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, I'll leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you keep your secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'm, I'm keen to know what sort of
projects are you currently excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: What seeds are you keen to pop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, um, my next, uh, uh,
flower round, um, I'm running through,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a ton of Bubba S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm finally going to do, you know,
work on my Bubba S two project.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got bomb threat, you know,
ready to, you know, get up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, uh, I also have a handful of
lemon party hybrids, lemon tree hybrids,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and, uh, some sweet 16 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, of course F1 derbs,
um, and, uh, a few other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: a few other things, but, uh, you know,
getting away from the whole, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, dessert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the, the last time I did mostly
dessert, dessert products, I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: something a little different this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understandable for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess I'd be keen to know,
you know, this is probably going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: weird question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to, happy to cut it out if it
doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what has been a line of yours that you
thought would be really popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, it turns out it just hasn't
quite had as much traction with the
[SPEAKER_00]: general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, pinks and purps is a perfect,
perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, I really like pinks,
pinks and purps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, I also, you know,
I'm not great at marketing either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I really didn't push it
like, you know, I could have should have,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, very, very few people were like,
woo hoo, woo hoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, you know, we've got to
change their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it on my Instagram soon on,
uh, on the other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, what's one of, if not your most
popular lines, if you just had to think
[SPEAKER_00]: off the top of your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, uh, everybody still,
I mean, overall people tend to like the S
[SPEAKER_01]: ones over the hybrids in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, the TKS ones, the ChemDS ones,
those are, those are always at the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, even, even though I do recommend
just for solely growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids are, you know, better than S ones,
but S ones are better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to, you know, breed your own
stuff with them, make your own selections.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and how much value do you think we,
we as a community should place on pheno
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I understand that,
you know, everyone, everyone wants to just
[SPEAKER_00]: run some Kiva clones and make some head
stash every so often, but me myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually try to have some new stuff in
their most rounds to just sort of be at
[SPEAKER_00]: least slowly injecting some stuff in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like we should try to impart
some impotence that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is value to always sort of having
some new stuff rolling in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really depends on where you're
at and you know, what, what you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, you know, what, what,
what's important to you, whether it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: personal smoke or you're, you're doing it
commercially or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, I mean, you know, uh,
I don't know, honestly, uh, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: always, always good to, you know,
run some new with the old, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, while we're talking about new and
old, I had no idea how I was going to slot
[SPEAKER_00]: these questions in, but this is it right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was specifically interested
because you've got this experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: the NL fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of me was wondering, is there any way
in which this or just in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: how your thoughts of Neville and his
accomplishments have changed over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years, you know, now that you've had
experience with some of these lines he was
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, for example, has anything
changed at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I went through a phase through,
through probably the mid late nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, all the way through, you know,
probably the mid two thousands where,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I grew up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't really impressed with anything
from Amsterdam, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you factor that in,
it's just like, eh, you know, but since
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, I, I've realized that
there's tons of stuff from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I just hadn't, you know,
I was too stubborn to grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of it based on, you know,
early formed opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think we can all acknowledge that
one way or the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the opposite way for a lot of
growers, you know, they're, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they end up lauding DNA genetics only to
realize it's not as good as they thought
[SPEAKER_00]: on, in that same sort of school of
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on Shanti?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever consider buying and growing
Mr. Nice Guy, or is there a bit like too
[SPEAKER_00]: many concerns about the current gear
versus the older gear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I have so much to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it would be very hard to, you know,
experiment with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, new, new stuff,
other stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said then, who,
who were some of the breeders who you,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least now, you know, have held in
higher steam from years gone by?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used to really like DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, then I talked to DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I kind of hoped I would have
learned more from DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very much an enigma, isn't he?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I'll probably cut this out,
but what's your thoughts on, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: JD and the whole blueberry Bubba claims?
[SPEAKER_01]: JD is entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a, he's a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: See now you don't have to cut it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that just about brings us to
our final five questions and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved a bit since the last time we
spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is if you had to restart
your company, let's just say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those horrible fires rips through
your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sincerely hope that never happens,
but let's just say hypothetically,
[SPEAKER_00]: it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to restart your company from
scratch with just one packet of seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've made can be regular, can be femme.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could find a female and
reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What one pack of seeds are you going to
pick to restart the company with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a pine tar Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's a solid pig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom would be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I loved pine tar Kush when I ran it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to revisit that one because I swear
I can, I can make some stuff with pine
[SPEAKER_01]: tar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll remind me of some of the old,
old stuff I got from my dad that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he, he got back in the early
eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, reminisce a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next one, we're going to drop you off
on a desert Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only take three strains with you
for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which three?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, three strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a sweet 16, you know,
cause it's a desert Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some tropical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about purple indica, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For our strong indica Dom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe a nice select cut of a,
wait, do I get a pack or just a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either, either or.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll definitely take some,
some Burmese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with that, I think I could breed,
you know, uh, whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
you're going to drop someone else off on
[SPEAKER_00]: the desert Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not particularly fond of this
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to leave them with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Australian bastard cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, I play.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't know if they could smoke it
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ornamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which out of the chem clones are your
favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that also like in terms of smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is that also the one you like to
breed or work with the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my favorite was the number four
until I lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I, I like the, the D,
um, overall, I think, um, but I think 91
[SPEAKER_01]: is like my favorite breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final question for this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: What gives you hope in the cannabis
community or what would you like to see
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to help things steer forward in a
path that you think would be best for us
[SPEAKER_00]: all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think, uh, I'd like to see more
people homegrown, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I want to see more people just,
you know, growing their own plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A brilliant sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think I'm good for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, incredibly grateful for your
time.

wizard himself blazing a path forward.
