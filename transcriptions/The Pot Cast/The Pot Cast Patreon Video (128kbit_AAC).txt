[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Heavy Days here from the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make a quick video to
explain what this Patreon is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past 12 months, I've received an
overwhelming amount of support and
[SPEAKER_00]: positive feedback for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, I cannot thank you all
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly been a labor of love and
something I've felt was more of a passion
[SPEAKER_00]: than a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with that being said,
the biggest criticism I've always got was
[SPEAKER_00]: that episodes took too long to come out
and that there wasn't enough regular
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, I've decided to
start this Patreon account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to dedicate more of my
time to being able to create better
[SPEAKER_00]: quality content and more importantly,
more regular content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've decided I'm going to be creating
content on a more regular basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: making two episodes a month, one being a
Patreon exclusive with an additional video
[SPEAKER_00]: for higher Patreon tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the additional Patreon content will
become available to the general public
[SPEAKER_00]: after a few weeks because I never wanted
to put anything behind a hard paywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, I was lucky enough to be able
to head over to the States and spend some
[SPEAKER_00]: time with some of my favorite breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to make some really good quality
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I fell short due to
underestimating the situations I'd be in
[SPEAKER_00]: and bringing the adequate gear for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to be able to get back to the
States and to be able to create some
[SPEAKER_00]: really high quality media content for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like walkthroughs in the gardens
with breeders like Bodhi, Brothers Grimm,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Rye, Coastal Seeds, Dynasty and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, whether you donate anything or
not is not important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just really grateful that people watch
the show and that people enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to be able to create
more content on a regular basis and I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that you guys enjoy it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do appreciate it, again,
feel free to sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps to have that extra funding
and it allows me to be able to spend more
[SPEAKER_00]: time creating the content that I'm hoping
you guys are going to love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to check out the description box
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure that there's some
information in there about what Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: fans can expect to get from their
exclusive rewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we can make this show even
better than it is already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a big thank you to everyone for
the support and thanks for listening.
I'll see you next time.
