[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_02]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by 420 Australia, your number one
[SPEAKER_02]: store for 420 lifestyle and apparel,
as well as Organic Gardening Solutions,
[SPEAKER_02]: your premier organic gardening store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know them, they're the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guarantee on satisfaction, not just
germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this episode, we're joined by the man,
the weed nerd himself, Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatting all things breeding and
controversy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome
to the infamous weed nerd himself,
[SPEAKER_02]: Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first question, we're going to do a
little change of pace here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know, what are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm smoking cookies and cream,
live resin rosin that a friend of mine
[SPEAKER_05]: sent to me because I'm getting the Cubans
cookies and cream cut next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm beta testing this live rosin and it
tastes like caramel and coffee with
[SPEAKER_05]: creamer in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly have never had anything that
nice before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's kind of the future of
concentrate is going in this super primo
[SPEAKER_02]: fashion?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was a big rosin head before the
house burned down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a Sasquatch rosin press and I
learned so much about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the flavors and everything you can get
are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take some really high quality water
hash and you press it and press all the
[SPEAKER_05]: contaminants out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you're left with is truly some of
the smoothest tastiest stuff in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I prefer to smoke THC crystals,
which are made with solvents and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't beat the flavor of live
resin press.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, like I said, it's like eating
caramel, but smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so are you a fan of the Sasquatch
presses?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a few people with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more a fan of the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were really nice to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the rosin pressers are good.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many people out there,
but Sasquatch themselves made me a press,
[SPEAKER_05]: put my logo on it, shipped it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when my house burnt down,
they built me another one and they have it
[SPEAKER_05]: ready to ship to my new house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't argue with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will jump back onto the regular
first question now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to draw out because it
sounds like such a bullshit, but it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I was around nine years old,
I had the opportunity to go to a concert
[SPEAKER_05]: with a guy that had a roach.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it was Edgar Winner or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we walked around the entire show,
even though everybody was smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were too scared to smoke it because
we were kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we went home to his house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember we stood on the toilet and
turned the fan on and we each got one hit
[SPEAKER_05]: and we blew it up into the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will never forget what it tasted
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was to me, the most incredible,
interesting thing I'd ever done in my
[SPEAKER_05]: life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So about a year and a half later,
I had a best friend who had an older
[SPEAKER_05]: sister who I used to look at her,
you know, she was, she was cute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have the thing for, and her
boyfriend left roaches in the ashtray,
[SPEAKER_05]: really long ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a cannabis seller.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, he was my hero.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was sleeping with her and he had weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I used to steal his joints,
the roaches, not steal his weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: but take his, you know, lipstick on them
from her.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we take them out back and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would make our ears ring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to continue that one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first time I got high, I heard in
my head, I mean, really high, about a
[SPEAKER_05]: little 10 ish or 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I heard it for years when I got high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was 15 when I heard the immigrant
song and I heard the sound again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the hell did I hear the immigrant song
when I got high, even though I didn't know
[SPEAKER_05]: Led Zeppelin was?
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You reckon maybe you heard it when you
were really young or just never exposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Led Zeppelin smoked some weed and
heard it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why they wrote the song.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of from that point forward,
how did you really get into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you obviously just progressively
started to smoke more from that age.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point did you kind of become,
did cannabis become really quite involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in your life?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I went to back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I come from the, I come from the South
where cannabis was very prohibited and it
[SPEAKER_05]: was very expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at a fairly early age, I don't want to,
I don't want to lie 16, 17.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I had a car.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I started buying weed from a guy
and selling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was the weed guy, you know,
always.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought pounds of seeded crappy
commercial weed and our profit margin back
[SPEAKER_05]: then was we sold six ounces to make our
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we kept six ounces of stash or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the way it always worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that continued until the drug war
kept in and cannabis went to $400 an ounce
[SPEAKER_05]: down in Gainesville with the Gainesville
green.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that time I started growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I from a bag and I put them out in my
yard and I, I grew some tall male female
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they got about my height,
I cut them down and smoked them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I started reading Ed's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did, there weren't such things as the
internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started reading books and it was a
book called since Amelia tips.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had pictures of pot plants on
concrete blocks with fans and lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I talked about females and males and I
got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, okay, I got to kill the males.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it talked about sex.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, wait a minute,
I just cut them down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next year we actually grew really
good cannabis outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we, we harvested at the end of the
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had resin on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we instantly became famous people in
our circle because we had dank seedless
[SPEAKER_05]: tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it, it made me people like me and I'm
going to say some things during this
[SPEAKER_05]: interview.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people get to know me better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a very serious inferiority complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I feel alone in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very gregarious and loud, but it's to
hide a shyness that I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis made me the fucking man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was the man chicks like me,
dudes like me, people like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it, it, it helped me get over this,
this thing I have where I just don't feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like I belong in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I just ran with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I started growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was growing in Georgia by the time I was
in my thirties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell the story quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Amsterdam to buy some seeds and
the guy that I was living with decided to
[SPEAKER_05]: rip all the pot plants off while I was
gone and kind of set up a pot plant in the
[SPEAKER_05]: front yard to get me busted.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I came back to a police tape and that
was my first bust.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went down for five years for,
um, they found the trailer where he moved
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they got us for 362 plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he got the majority of the problems
because I was out of town, but,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I got my five and then, um,
I moved to Florida because they banned me
[SPEAKER_05]: from Georgia and my son was in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to see him on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I legally moved close where I could
skip over the state line and see him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started doing the one thing I know
best.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started growing weed in Gainesville.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorite stories before I took a
pause on the story is never forget the
[SPEAKER_05]: probation officer called me in my grow
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, well, how's everything going?
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at my plants and I think
everything is going fucking great,
[SPEAKER_05]: dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how I got started.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just grew weed and soul weed and in
Florida, I also got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got busted there for selling really good
cannabis and they kind of found us,
[SPEAKER_05]: which led to me leaving, um, to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lived in Amsterdam for a couple of years
with gypsy Nirvana hiding from the cops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I came back in through Canada,
lived in Canada for a while, finally got
[SPEAKER_05]: busted in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and they extradited me to America
where I came back in and did my time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm clean, no probate, no,
no felon.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's I'm clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have felonies, but I don't have any
probation and nothing on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is when I moved to the West
coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I moved to the West coast,
I moved to Oregon where cannabis was not
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I stopped getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely need to wind back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hours worth of stories to dig
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing which caught my
attention was all the way back at the
[SPEAKER_02]: start, you mentioned, um, Ed's book in
those early days, who were some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other people who you looked up to besides
Ed, you know, cause I, the thing that I
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to notice was besides Ed and maybe
Neville, there wasn't a lot of people you
really looked up to.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no one mate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we didn't heard a herd of Jack,
but you know, uh, me and Ed are friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys don't know, Ed is really like
calling pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: He calls me son.
[SPEAKER_05]: He published my book.
[SPEAKER_05]: He helped me get my book in the Jefferson
Memorial library, the library of Congress.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the guy's awesome guy,
but it's not like I believe everything's
[SPEAKER_05]: Ed says the whole photos interrupt this
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we argued, but when I was growing up,
there was one book.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the marijuana encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: On our toilet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we went to the bathroom,
we read it and it was Ed and Mel and we
[SPEAKER_05]: read it forwards and backwards and
backwards and forwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, I mean that and since the
media tips, I mentioned it earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you remember since the
media tips, that was the first cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: magazine I ever saw because at the time
high times had cocaine and heroin and
[SPEAKER_05]: pills.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it, it wasn't a cannabis cultivation
magazine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a drug magazine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there was no one else.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was no internet and there were no
books.
[SPEAKER_05]: And believe me in Georgia, you didn't even
let anybody know you had that grow book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different times, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, what type of
strains were you growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any breeders that you're aware
of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was everyone just kind of growing their
own little thing they had?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we would know the very first named
stream I grew was grape ape, but it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: the grape ape.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would know it was just a bag of weed
we bought from Tabi Island, Georgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was purple and it was killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had about 20 seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we grew it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, now, now I'm wondering,
was it feminized?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it a harm?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it one male?
[SPEAKER_05]: How did they get them?
[SPEAKER_05]: But we grew it out and it was killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mentioned it at the time,
and I'll take some heat for this cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: was $7,200 a pound in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wanted really good cannabis and
they all called it dro hydro, even though
[SPEAKER_05]: we grew in soil, but that's really the
where it was at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only when I ordered and I love
telling the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ordered them from Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ordered Puna butter and I ordered
something called Dominion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was, I wish I could do years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the guy that does in 1986.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know when the fuck it was,
but it was, it was when you, when you
[SPEAKER_05]: bought seeds from Mark and some girl sent
them to you, it went like to some website
[SPEAKER_05]: and you send him a money order.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Puna butter was $60 for 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I grew it out and I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, my great bait was
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's when I actually flew to
Amsterdam for the first time and bought,
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a bunch of American growers that I
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got 3000 American dollars,
which was 8,000 Gielder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I smuggled back about a thousand seeds
for all the growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know in the United States, I put them in
my belt buckle and we snuck them all out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that, and this is going to sound
so cocky from that overgrow was formed
[SPEAKER_05]: because some of my friends got Northern
lights and some of my guys got black
[SPEAKER_05]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of my guys got white widow and some
of my guys got Russian and we all started
[SPEAKER_05]: working together and growing and working
with the Canadians that also have
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how these things form.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Northern lights five, bam,
right there in the channel is being mixed
[SPEAKER_05]: with white widow and G 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those strains are still around
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite is a mighty Mike chemo widow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would blister you like it would make
you not be able to speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously that's not commonly spoken
about at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess a lot of this stuff has fallen
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fallen off and it's gotten mixed in
with others.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, remember those stories I
told.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in Georgia, when they rated me,
I lost 83 mothers, I lost dank ass bitch
[SPEAKER_05]: DAB.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a strain that growers would know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost, I lost Nebo's Russian.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost, I mean, I lost, lost tons and tons
of moms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I lost another thousand seeds
that can never be replaced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would imagine that a lot of the core
genetics that we have built and collected
[SPEAKER_05]: over the years before the things changed,
they got destroyed by the police.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just to loop back on that trip to
Amsterdam quickly, do you remember what
[SPEAKER_02]: brands you were buying based off what you
said?
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like you were buying a lot of
the seed bank and, uh, as well as maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Superstiva seed club, you know,
with those, the people who were around at
[SPEAKER_02]: that time, or was it a little after that?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, they were, the greenhouse was
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I was a big fan of Sirius seeds,
a white Russian AK 47, a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also Tony was Sargamantha who comes to
my chat channel and hangs out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm blown away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he used to sell that Yumbolt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we went to a place they're called the
gray area and the gray area is an
[SPEAKER_05]: Americanized coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Dutch.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have soda pops and rock and roll and
metal tables.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Keefe they had there, the Cali
Miss Keefe was some of the best I've ever
[SPEAKER_05]: smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went to buy the genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smoked at the coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were naive.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like, that's where the good shit
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the good seeds are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that first trip, we bought a lot of AK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, that AK that I bought,
that cherry AK still used to breed with
[SPEAKER_05]: today by about four breeding companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you of the opinion that the stock
back then was generally of higher quality
[SPEAKER_02]: than it is today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm, I'm, I don't want to start a
war, but for sure it's pretty common for
[SPEAKER_05]: them to lose them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can guarantee you that AK 47 we
bought in 87 was not the AK 47 that I grew
[SPEAKER_05]: out three years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was homogenized crap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not talking, talking bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was tons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got three pounds off the, off the pack,
giant plants, but it was homogenized.
[SPEAKER_05]: It lacked character and what we call dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we scoot a little forward,
then you mentioned that the AK 47,
[SPEAKER_02]: the AK 47, the AK 47, you mentioned coming
back, a lot of these genetics giving birth
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of overgrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, was there many people
bringing seeds back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: There were, but we weren't organized.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what Overgrow gave to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overgrow gave us a platform to speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was speaking to bog and I was
speaking to soul and I was speaking to
[SPEAKER_05]: beak high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we started sharing notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what are you growing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what do you breed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I make killer queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you make?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have a G13.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when we started trading
genetics and growing together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So me and soul and sly used to talk a lot
with the A13, the Cindy, and then Vic had
[SPEAKER_05]: the space queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you wonder how I created Vortex,
I knew those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they gave me their genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I crossed them together and I get a lot of
credit for the A13 crosses the Vortex
[SPEAKER_05]: because it won the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: A guy grew out of five pack, renamed it
God.
[SPEAKER_05]: God's pussy and beat me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I got the very best phenotype from
soul, which was one female A13 out of 500
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds, the only one that existed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I crossed at time space queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm sorry, but if you have really
good shit and you mix it together,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you need to be super
skilled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I take heat on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: People like, well, subs not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I had to make it somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the exchange of knowledge through
overgrow change the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It allowed me to talk to another grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you grow a grown water?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your pH?
[SPEAKER_05]: This.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you growing?
[SPEAKER_05]: This.
[SPEAKER_05]: That knowledge just super speeded cannabis
growing in America.
[SPEAKER_05]: We learned about lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: We learned about CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: We learned about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: We learned about super soil through Vic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vic had a very basic recipe online called
Vic's super soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still have that copy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took the recipe and added about 25 units
of things to it to make it better in my
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people still use that super soil today
without overgrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have never talked to Vic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vic would have never gave me his recipe
and we would have never had super soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was the knowledge that overgrow gave
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't all the bullshit and the trolls
and the karma liking system that was being
[SPEAKER_05]: able to PM bog and say, bro, let me have a
cut of your bog bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure sub.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about, how about a cut of your Jack's
cleaner?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but let's make Jack's cleaner
blueberry, which bog still uses today to
[SPEAKER_05]: make life safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, you touched on so many
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll rewind back, try to quickly
touch on, you referenced the God's pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question I was going to ask later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, do you have any plans to maybe
try to get that cut and breed with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause my friends from round table
basically explained this cut to me and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were saying like, yeah, it's,
you know, kind of believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so immediately I was like,
like, you know, what's the go with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you grow a hundred seeds, vortex seeds,
you'll get 49 of those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was one, there was 1% difference
between my phenotype and his mind tasted a
[SPEAKER_05]: little peachy.
[SPEAKER_05]: His was a little more lemony.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that year the judges that were judging
like citrus, they were stand even.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that sounds cocky, but it's not,
it's last, I was looking for a male
[SPEAKER_05]: vortex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: About six years ago, and this is
documented on Roll It Up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started 20 seeds and I got 19 damn
females, not what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every single one of them was exactly
the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you go look at the thread,
there's 19 plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just taking pictures of them over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Slight differences between peach,
pear, lemon, you know, that, that slight
[SPEAKER_05]: essence of cannabis turps, but it's the
most stable strain I've ever created.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't do anything to it, but cross a
male and a female plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another thing I just remembered that
you spoke about was you referenced talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to Sly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sly is someone who really had to get a lot
of information about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your relationship with him like,
and you know, kind of how was your,
[SPEAKER_02]: what was your impression of him?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, Sly, both Sly and Vic and
me had a very unique way of learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: We argued with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you, if you had seen it,
it was like, you dumb ass, you don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that, that exchange of information got
us somewhere, but Sly was the kinder.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the smarter.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the scientist, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul was definitely more of the sales guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not knocking Rick.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he was sitting here right beside me,
I'd say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was with his fingernail polish and his,
and his Cinderella slippers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he's a good, good, good salesman
and a very good representative of the
[SPEAKER_05]: company, but Sly had the brains,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew, he knew about dominance and
trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he knew how to work these trains
together and he knew what would work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as importantly, he's brave enough to
send us all clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you knew Vic High when I was 20ish,
if you asked Vic for a clone, he'd just
[SPEAKER_05]: send you a cutout of Killer Queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we didn't have clone shippers back
then, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a different game, but we got it
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I did want to quickly mention
was I think for a lot of people like
[SPEAKER_02]: myself, you were the person who kind of
got him into organics through making the
[SPEAKER_02]: super soil easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, you know, a big thank you
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm very passionate about organics
now, but something which it led me to do
[SPEAKER_02]: was to dive further into the super soil
recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe I found a screenshot of a
really old overgrowth thread where Vic
[SPEAKER_02]: actually says that he found the recipe in
an old book by like forest agronomist or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he basically said that they would make
this recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would put the dry amendments under
big trees when they transplanted big trees
[SPEAKER_02]: into forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'd, you know, they'd grow into the
nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, you know, it's just,
it's just continually built over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's a bit of a,
people make the mistake of thinking that
[SPEAKER_02]: he fully made it and it's never been
modified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the point that you brought up is
really relevant that you added a lot to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do compare his recipe to yours,
you'll see that yours is a lot more kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of holistic and in all of the amendments,
whereas his is a lot more bare bones and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just, you know, like manure and blood
and bone and one or two other things
[SPEAKER_02]: really.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes further.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, kids take my super soil
that are smarter than me and they adjust
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They measure it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They take it to soil shops, build a soil
has an entire fucking thread based on my
[SPEAKER_05]: super soil where one scientist says,
I'm an idiot and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And another scientist explains why it does
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can buy super soil from build a
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy the dirt and a charge pack and
you just mix the shit up and put a worm
[SPEAKER_05]: castings in it and you have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only thing I did with, with super
soil was give people the idea to mix it up
[SPEAKER_05]: in your backyard and play with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've made hot batches.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've made coal batches, gnats are part of
super soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go ahead and tell you now the newest
thing we do is we put two inches of neem
[SPEAKER_05]: cake on top of all the barrels.
[SPEAKER_05]: After we make super soil, it prevents the
fungus gnats from getting down into the
[SPEAKER_05]: compost and the manure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you go to use it,
you just scrape the neem cake off of your
[SPEAKER_05]: hands and throw it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the little bit extra that stays is
good for the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something brand new we figured
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So super soil is not static and it's not
for sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the way a guy grows pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, if somebody went to me shit
about it, they can kiss my ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how I grow pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Vic, Vic taught me to take dirt and
mix it up in tubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other thing that we do now is
when we first made super soil,
[SPEAKER_05]: we use really shitty ingredients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I buy the most expensive ingredients
and organic down to earth, expensive
[SPEAKER_05]: soils, nice crabs, crab meals,
stuff that's made properly and not cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's another reason super soil works
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so you know, I mean, we have
people here in Arizona that grow
[SPEAKER_05]: commercially in super soil, buildings full
of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think maybe I'm wrong, but I think
the no till revolution kind of spurned
[SPEAKER_05]: from this.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do with all the super soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we don't want to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So guys started figuring out how to do no
till and treat with teas and hell geek
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike up in Oregon takes a super soil and
runs it through like a machine and shakes
[SPEAKER_05]: everything out of it and rebuilds it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's got a factory to redo super soil
so they don't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Vic taught us so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: He taught us that you could grow dank
without hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a lot of us played with the soil
until we got it where it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's definitely some truth in
that statement you made in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: super soil and the no till, which has come
after it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I have seen raised a bit though
is people do seem to feel as though super
[SPEAKER_02]: soil is quite wasteful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever, you know, in that you do
inevitably have to exchange the soil out
[SPEAKER_02]: after a run or two, would you ever
consider doing more of a no till option?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't throw super soil out at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done super soil out in years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a hundred gallon pots in our pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't reuse it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we don't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't throw a hundred pounds of soil
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: You amend it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put teas in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One problem indoors is a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So outdoors you can amend the pots in the
middle of the season, cover them with
[SPEAKER_05]: straw, and you get a nice, you know,
you get a nice natural re-amendment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indoors, we don't have the same issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when we finish our giant plants
indoors, we take a five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_05]: that's got the bottom cut off of it like a
razor and cut it down into the pot and cut
[SPEAKER_05]: the root ball out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is the same process.
[SPEAKER_05]: You re-amend.
[SPEAKER_05]: You use teas and you build a giant cover
crop in between while your plants are
[SPEAKER_05]: vegging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cover it with straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same process.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to do it faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have small problems?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indoors is not as easy as outdoors,
but there are definitely growers now that
[SPEAKER_05]: grow in super soil that have not changed
their soil out in many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we just kind of jump back to
what we were talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got back and you had the seeds and
overgrowings just started out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this when you would consider yourself
to have truly kind of begun the breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: journey or do you feel like you started a
little before that?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's where.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I made Jack's Cleaner Blueberry and I
made, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack's Cleaner BX and I made Danny Boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a site, a sister site to
overgrow called Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on Cannabis World was the auctions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we went to Seabay and you could put
your seeds up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember the first pack of seeds I
put up with Danny Boy was $5.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stayed up for three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: No bids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stayed up for two days and someone bought
it for $5.
[SPEAKER_05]: Within a year, people were bidding on the
seeds upwards of $40 to $50.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bog join, soul was in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to tell you this crazy story
about human nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the seed place, you could buy a pack
of seeds for a price.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called instant purchase.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then as a breeder, you could list a
pack of seeds up there for less than let
[SPEAKER_05]: people bid on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some bizarre human nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: People would bid past the instant purchase
price.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there'd be a pack of Danny Boy sitting
there for $40 and three guys would be
[SPEAKER_05]: bidding up the other pack to $90.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a businessman, I just fucking
laughed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, if you want to pay me $40 more
for it so you guys can argue with each
[SPEAKER_05]: other, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So an enormous amount of money was made on
the Seabay with people bidding against
[SPEAKER_05]: each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a form of trolls and haters
already already starting on the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: People arguing with each other over a pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a seed seller, not a breeder,
I laughed my ass off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, all are overpaying for the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just part of the history of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems as though so many kind of
notable breeders did get their starting
[SPEAKER_02]: foot in these forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like there's any reason as to
why we don't see the same popularity for
[SPEAKER_02]: forums nowadays?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be quite contained to like
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I think trolls are a big part of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's, there's this,
we're going to talk about this as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I mean, I will bring it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when you said I was going to go on
the show today at 150 comments,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was the biggest piece of shit on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to roll it up right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, Hey, I grow good pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom's subbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You suck dicks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's exhausting on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing occurs, but you can block
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ban them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get rid of the comments on roll it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody's up your ass, there's nothing
you can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if every time you post a picture,
the guy calls you a dumb ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is you just set it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I carry Instagram in my phone,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't got to sit at my house and upload
pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to, you know, remember the
old uploading a picture to overgrow would
[SPEAKER_05]: take like five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that shit dial-ups and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, nowadays somebody sends me a
picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hit a button and I may make it an
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other part of it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are too many forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it got fragmented when roll it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: When overgrow got started.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all at one place.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's roll it up, which is run by a
bunch of kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no moderator.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Seabay.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's IC mag, which I've been banned for
life because gypsy doesn't like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never even get go there as funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of his guys called me one day to
advertise there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, gypsy won't even let me
live.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to buy an ad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's thousands more.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's cannabis and this and this and
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's fragmented.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of a hundred thousand growers
all in one spot talking every day,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's spread apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could compare it to dating sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, you know, if there's one dating
site, then you meet everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if there's a thousand, how the hell do
you find everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in the pot business,
you're on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So something we haven't been able to get
any information from people, but you'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: the perfect person.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it like to live with gypsy?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's he like as a guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, it's all, it's all going to sound
bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll spend a few minutes on it,
but it's all going to sound bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I met him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, over the, over the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went over and I lived with him and his
wife, Nikki.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in England, stayed in a little pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought English breakfast was
intriguing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nikki was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: His crew was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then gypsy got a business opportunity
to go to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went with him and we opened up his
shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's eight at 42.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd like, uh, my pictures are literally
still in the guy's shop because I had a
[SPEAKER_05]: laptop with all my photographs on it and
gypsy didn't have photographs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but the guy, this gypsies,
two people, and then we can talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: this with me too, cause I've had my bout
this gypsy was a fairly decent gentleman
[SPEAKER_05]: when he didn't drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the afternoon he would send me for
two bottles of red wine and I would go get
[SPEAKER_05]: his, I was his do boy, make no,
let's not glamorize this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gypsies bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd get on the bike and I'd ride up and
get him a couple of bottles of wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then by eight o'clock he was screaming
and hollering at me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you on the fucking internet,
mate?
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck you sought?
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's rude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people have seen gypsy attack people
online.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't, I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gypsy in the morning was a fairly
decent guy, bought you breakfast,
[SPEAKER_05]: take you around his car, show you some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: When he drank, he was rude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I will address that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people, one of the things that
somebody said to me is that, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: in public, I was rude to them between the
time I was diagnosed with a fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: progressive fatal illness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today I went through some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was about a year, I will tell
you right off, I was checked out of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was drinking, I was taking drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to escape a diagnosis of
choking to death on my own snot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my shit together and I don't do
drugs anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had a drink or a pharmaceutical
drug in over 450 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I won't, don't think I'll ever do them
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason I bring that up is alcohol
is a fucked up thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what I found in gypsy was
alcohol, not gypsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know that until I had my own
bout with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So about three years ago, if you came in
contact with me and I was rude as shit to
[SPEAKER_05]: you, I was trying to kill myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause some doctor told me I was going to
choke to death in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have dealt with it emotionally and I
plan to live my life every day,
[SPEAKER_05]: the best I can until that time comes,
instead of sitting around and worrying
[SPEAKER_05]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a, it's a really good,
kind of message.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people will be happy
to hear that just to kind of, how do you,
[SPEAKER_02]: how did you wrap up the Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you said that you ended up going
to Canada after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, let's no mate back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my best gypsy had this great idea to
turn this giant house where it had a table
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Anne Frank house and on this,
excuse me, a chandelier from the Anne
[SPEAKER_05]: Frank house and a table that came from an
old hash baron.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the house was a hash baron's house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking history mate was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guy that owned it was worth $42 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: African guys, super nice people,
drum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was all a great thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gypsy had the idea to set it up as a hotel
and have a bunch of American stoners come
[SPEAKER_05]: over and stay party, smoke weed,
pay gypsies, stay in this awesome house
[SPEAKER_05]: that's in the red light district.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the whore houses across the street
is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first person I had bring over was
my best friend, Danny boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before I tell the story, I will tell
you that Danny was almost 40.
[SPEAKER_05]: He ate only meat.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't eat vegetables.
[SPEAKER_05]: He smoked four packs of cigarettes a day
and he worked all night at a roach coast
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's fucking out of shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he came over to Amsterdam and partied
with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were cannabis cup judges.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gypsy was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a cannabis chup judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a real one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the real shit hash weed,
everything sitting there in the house,
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Danny, um, we smoked 20 something
samples of weed hash and Danny was,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna just say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Danny liked prostitutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't, he didn't have a way with women
back at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I don't think the guy ever fell
in love in his life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a sad story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he'd come to Amsterdam and spend his
yearly income getting laid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second night he came back,
the story is hard for me to tell,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the second night he came back,
he was sweaty and he was winded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he came in and he sat down and he was
obviously, you know, I said, are you okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: bud?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, oh man, that was rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, I'm just, my heart's pounding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still, you know, I just need to go lay
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, well, do you want to go to the
hospital?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, well, do you know where hospital
is?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, fuck no, it's two o'clock in the
morning Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm as stoned as you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's like, I'm going to go lay down,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he went lay down and the next morning
at breakfast, he wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess it was like seven 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, where the hell is he at?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went upstairs and he was dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was laying in gypsy's fourth floor and
he had died of a heart attack in his
[SPEAKER_05]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had to carry his body down the
steps.
[SPEAKER_05]: First time I'd ever seen a dead person and
especially my fucking best friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, by the way, I performed CPR on
him for about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cause I thought death rattle was life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now perform CPR on a dead guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always good for your brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get, we get blown out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get blunt to the American embassy,
get him home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm supposed to, I do all the things
that friends supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I come back and gypsies drinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: So within a couple of hours, he said,
get y'all fucking shit mate and get out
[SPEAKER_05]: more fucking house.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't pay me and he threw me out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had about 200 gilder and I called RC
the owner of overgrow and he said,
[SPEAKER_05]: fly to Canada, just get your ass to
Montreal and I'll get you some money and
[SPEAKER_05]: some weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I landed.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, this story is so weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I landed and I took a cab to this high
performance F1 club.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's all these fancy models and
Jackie Stewart likes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not belong there, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was an American on the run with my ass
kicked, but there was RC and he picked me
[SPEAKER_05]: up and he took me to a little hotel called
the same around a little teeny little
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gave me some weed, which RC did not
carry weed because he owned overgrow and
[SPEAKER_05]: he gave me some money, 300 or $400.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from there, I went into the middle of
the country in Amsterdam to, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: excuse me, to Winnipeg to a weed nerd's
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at the time was not a weed nerd,
just a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started on a girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, basically, can I come to your
house and grow shitload of weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how I got from Amsterdam to
Canada was Danny dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I named that stream Danny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you think that's effective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you in the long-term having to kind of
been there for Danny's death and the
[SPEAKER_02]: subsequent, you know, there was a,
it's obviously like a dramatic kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: exit in its own, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what pissed me off because I couldn't
come back to the United States to watch
[SPEAKER_05]: him get buried because I was a fugitive
from, from the law for growing fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to deal with not going there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to deal with people hating on me
because I didn't love Danny.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't even go up to the fucking
funeral.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can imagine how torturous that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was stuck in Amsterdam on my best
friend, you know, I mean, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_05]: stuck in a, it was in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could not come back into the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I later actually went and saw
Danny's gravestone and Danny's mother and
[SPEAKER_05]: father were both friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Danny's father has since died.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to tell you, one of the things
I'll get all fucking sad, but one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: things I lost in the fire was I had a hand
drawn picture of Danny and it burned up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have a picture of Danny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's tough to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I thought was always really
inspiring though was that you did create
[SPEAKER_02]: that strain in his honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you ever plan to maybe
try to work with further?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've heard you speak about it on
the weed nerds episode, but I think you
[SPEAKER_02]: also said that the stock's kind of gone as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the taco mom was lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then not only that, you know,
Danny boy was very special to me,
[SPEAKER_05]: Danny, and so was Danny boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 500 and something seeds that I
created, if you don't have a cut,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't get to see it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we just go back to the Canadian part
of the story, you were at your friend's
[SPEAKER_02]: house growing the weed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you manage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweetly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweetly, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what strains were you growing in Canada
at the time?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: AB High had given us AB and Hive and the
Dab, the Blueberry, the Cheese,
[SPEAKER_05]: G13, AK 47, all of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can shorten the Canadian story
simple because we don't need to tell a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lived in Winnipeg.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 45 below, freezing as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We moved into a house and we grew 10
pounds of dank in two months.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we dropped it onto the street and the
cops were like, where the fuck did this
[SPEAKER_05]: come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a kid named Miles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weed was 2,200 a pound in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, well, I don't sell my weed for
2,200.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to 3,200.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, you'll never do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I harvested, showed it to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, yeah, we'll pay 3,200 for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then within a month we got busted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the cops knew, they knew that
there was weed in the city and they just
[SPEAKER_05]: chased it back to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never forget.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in Florida, when I got operated,
they kicked my door down, held a machine
[SPEAKER_05]: gun to my head, put the knee in my back,
generally treated me like shit,
[SPEAKER_05]: stole everything from the house,
stole my CDs, just treated me like shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Canada, they rang the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Mike, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't, don't be silly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I sat down and while they were busting
us, they found the warrant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you're going to love this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love to tell the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stayed in Canada for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a place called the Headingley Hilton
built in 1929.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a chef.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cooked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't the worst gig you ever had for
12 months in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got high in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had food in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have a blanket so you could beat
off in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of things you can't do in America.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like the worst experience of my
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then they deported me to America and at
the border of Dakota and Winnipeg,
[SPEAKER_05]: they let me out, Cavalier, North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stayed in this little box and the guard
cooked mac roni and cheese and hamburger
[SPEAKER_05]: helper and peas.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was supper.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how small this place was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they held me and they asked Florida to
come get me and Florida didn't want me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they held me for 30 days and I had a
law there that says if Florida doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: come get you in 30 days, they let you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they let me go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I moved in down in to the city and went
to work with a friend of mine named Squid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked as a heating and air salesperson.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to your house and gave you an
estimate and I was good at my job.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one night I went through a damn speed
zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy picked me up, came to the car.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, you know, you got a warrant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I toss it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, I got a warrant in Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to come get me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this place was a little different.
[SPEAKER_05]: They held you for nine months and they
call Florida every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the 11th hour, the very 11th hour,
they came and got me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started talking to Jill at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was writing me every day and we had
started a relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got me at the last hour, 1159.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's something that this is part of
the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something in America called
Transcor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go look it up on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Transcor Prisoner Services.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: We transport your prisoners in luxury.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They strapped us together in a school bus
and drove us 10,000 miles and fed us
[SPEAKER_05]: McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you pass by the jail you're
supposed to go to, you ride right by it
[SPEAKER_05]: because they can keep you on the bus for
30 days and they make a thousand dollars a
[SPEAKER_05]: day per prisoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they keep it full and they drive it
out around and there's hundreds of them in
[SPEAKER_05]: America right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the most egregious shit I've ever
heard in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Transcor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was shackled to another man for 17
days and I shit in a steel box and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: fed McDonald's three times a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I swear to God, that's a true story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure I ever heard of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's really kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how they transport a prisoner from
one place to the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason they treat you so shitty is
because you're convicted.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not, you know, you're not like
going to court.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on the run or you're moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, I was strapped to a guy that blew
his dad away with a shotgun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty, pretty crazy to take a guy
who grows pot and has a loud mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if I have a flaw, I have a loud
mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and put him through the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I learned so much shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned about guns and murder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I learned every criminal
element you could ever learn in your life
[SPEAKER_05]: in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then anyway, so that was Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: They dragged me down to Florida and I get
to Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just let me go.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, well, we don't want you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, why the hell did you come get
me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they kept calling us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they gave me three years drug
probation, which is you basically piss
[SPEAKER_05]: once a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go every Wednesday and piss in
a cup for three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I quit smoking weed and I passed that test
and I got off probation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't imagine even to have him do it
for like a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were you growing during that time as
well?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just abstaining?
[SPEAKER_04]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the story when the guy called me
and he said, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, man, everything's going
fucking great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was standing in the grow room,
but I didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: You fail a piss test on, on, on this kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go back to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like you don't get a wrist
slap.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have two years and four months left
and you piss dirty, you go back to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty incentive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gale or not get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess from a different angle,
those were kind of financially profitable
[SPEAKER_02]: years seeing as you were just,
just a marketer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida's, you know, Florida's was around
$7,000 a pound and I lived in Gainesville
[SPEAKER_05]: and we were just pumping it out to the
college there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ounces were 400 to 450, maybe 500 on a
weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, it's the drug war created
these prices.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought my first bag of weed for $40.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Nancy Reagan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice car.
[SPEAKER_05]: I drove in that bad ass house.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really nice of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a raise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of parallels in Australia
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, the prices are arguably
even a little higher than what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: quoting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to be, but yeah, very much the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's applying demand to the
largest extent.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what type of strains were you growing
in Florida?
[SPEAKER_02]: And were you aware of any other kind of
notable people in the Florida area doing
[SPEAKER_02]: their thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, did you think like,
Oh, there's, there's definitely someone in
[SPEAKER_02]: the town over and they're putting out some
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the opening of this killer
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I met a dude named Tommy Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: He passed away last year, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met him and he came into my house and he
had a joint of this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fluorescent green.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was Gainesville green.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're from the South, you know what
I'm talking about, but it had a name,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he goes, it's Mickey and Opie
moonbeam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, we got the Mickey and Opie
moonbeam and the Mickey and Opie madness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I find both of these strains a little
leafy now as a grower and breeder,
[SPEAKER_05]: but at the time they were fucking Afghanis
that finished at nine weeks and we were
[SPEAKER_05]: getting two and a half pounds of bud off
of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, we were just crushing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were using Hydrofarm 1000s on light
movers and in a bedroom, I was getting
[SPEAKER_05]: four pounds every 60 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, that's $28,000 every two
months in a fucking two bedroom apartment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, you know, that's what we
ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: We literally ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a little desk downstairs that I'd
interneted and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this part of the story always cracks
me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was on the internet called Merck,
internet chat relay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked, same thing, trading clones,
trading information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in pot, weed, reefer and all the
stuff and lots of friends that are on the
[SPEAKER_05]: internet now or we're in those IRC days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot like Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to be honest with you,
we're chatting and talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just got some more pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was online and there's this,
you'll love this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We made a sound wave that said,
I think I can recreate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It said, hello, this is Subcool Haru with
a bong hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I go forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I, so it's, we used to play it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a real bong hit that went on for a
really long time and they used to play it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I'm, and all you got to do to play
it is type wave sub slash in the text and
[SPEAKER_05]: it plays.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm cuffed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting on the couch.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends don't know I'm on the couch
cuffed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they keep playing the fucking wave
while the cops were now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so the cop reached over and snatched
the cord out of the wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you snatch a computer out on
Merck, it does something called a K line
[SPEAKER_05]: in the, in the text box.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says K line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And three of my friends, word of God said,
I wonder if sub got busted in the channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, I wonder if sub got
busted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I didn't come back for a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is kind of a funny one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, from Florida, how'd you then
transition to the West coast?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, once I got, once I got out of
Florida, uh, I talked the guy into letting
[SPEAKER_05]: me come to Oregon to be with Jill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I convinced him that I had a job and I
didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't mean like at a fucking gas
station.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I'm actually a trained engineer,
heating and air professional.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do blower dough technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand refrigeration, gas piping,
electrical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my dad taught me all that when I was
young.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I told the guy's guy, well,
I got a job with the train corporation
[SPEAKER_05]: making like $80,000 a year and I can't get
it here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he'd let me go out there and then me,
I had three days to get the job.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I opened up the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to every train dealer and I sold
the fuck out of myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one guy's wife said, either this guy's
full of shit or he really knows a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: about heating and air.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they gave me a job.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, that was, you know, that was out
there with Jill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I worked every day up in Lyons,
Georgia as I started literally framing in
[SPEAKER_05]: houses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he wasn't impressed when I had to
have him call my probation officer,
[SPEAKER_05]: by the way, after I got the job,
Hey buddy, I need you to make a call for
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he put me to work, roughing up houses,
putting in ducks and shit, but it was
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't long.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could tell I worked my ass off and I
was a good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I became head of sales and I started
growing cannabis and Oregon under the
[SPEAKER_05]: medical program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when a home that me and Jill had,
we moved to the country to a bigger house
[SPEAKER_05]: and I filled the fucking upstairs with
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sold weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of the success of, uh, sub cool,
um, is the weed I grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we sold some seeds and shit,
but while Jill was raising kids and
[SPEAKER_05]: homeschooling and gym and then things that
mom do, I grew reefer and I fucking sold
[SPEAKER_05]: reefer as much as I possibly could.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I wanted to put the kids to school.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted a nice house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to buy nice things.
[SPEAKER_05]: For my family.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to have a retirement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I pay taxes like any good American.
[SPEAKER_05]: I voted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will fucking tell you one thing right
now about sub cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I pay my fucking taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: My accountant is LH Harris and I pay my
taxes and I always have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how basically we got started.
[SPEAKER_05]: We worked there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We formed a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and we sold stuff on the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't long and I built the website.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you that I hand typed every
fucking word, took every picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people want to talk about claiming
things, you know, in my organization,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's only one guy that wrote,
built that website.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only one guy that did the
pollination.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with all the breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I went out and I found jinx and OD
and all those guys, they're great people
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're great growers and everything,
but I had to teach them how to breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't breeders here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take a male, stick it in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take this much time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to stagger this male seven days.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to stagger this male nine days
and taking nothing away from these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the most talented people in the
world I have worked with, with giant egos,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I took their seeds and I sent them
overseas and I put them on catalogs and I
[SPEAKER_05]: put them on posters and I put them on high
times magazines and we developed these
[SPEAKER_05]: strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when people talk about, Oh,
so did make it well bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I shipped it to fucking Amsterdam and I
set up a store and I sold it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're one of my breeders that are
out there talking shit about me that don't
[SPEAKER_05]: work for me anymore, there's a reason your
shit is in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason your shit's in Israel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because I sent it there and I
wanted to make that very clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to maybe clarify, why do you think
OD and jinx, for example, because I think
[SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned those two specifically,
why do you think they've just moved on to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, doing their own thing or is
there a reason why they've moved on?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very type A.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll give you the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I used to pay these guys $2 for seeds
and sell them for four.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they got famous enough, they just
sold them for four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't need sub cool no more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody knows who we are, but it's the
ego is a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you right now, jinx is a
great guy, great breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hate it ever got like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact remains, if you work for Pepsi
Cola and you develop a product and Pepsi
[SPEAKER_05]: Cola spends $50,000 developing your
product, it's Pepsi product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's simple patent and trademark law.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only difference between now and then
is if you do business with me now,
[SPEAKER_05]: you sign a contract and we agree on
everything, including the divorce.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens if you don't pay the bills?
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens if you don't provide the
seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens if your seeds hermaphrodite?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have a contract and the only
difference I'm so sick of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only difference was two guys broke as
fuck, shook hands on a deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then later down the road, there was a
shitload of money involved and the
[SPEAKER_05]: handshake didn't meet anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if people don't understand that,
I really don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the real truth of the matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I busted my ass traveling around this
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote books and put magazines in it,
thousands of posts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did not create these strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not saying I did, I marketed them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's law.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you create something as a company,
it becomes your proprietary property.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've never done anything different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't breathe with those strains,
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I simply want somebody to give me some
simple credit and I'm gonna go hard on
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Jinx walked on stage and won fucking
the cannabis cup with a high now pound
[SPEAKER_05]: hammer and he won it, all I wanted him to
say was, thanks sub.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fuck, what was wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: But instead of that, we created a war and
I lost a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we all are this division of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even dislike each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome family, great people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was money.
[SPEAKER_05]: $2 wasn't enough, so let's sell it on the
open market for $4.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't flaw anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody should get in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you do business with me now,
you sign a contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Contracts are how we do business.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason we didn't sign contracts in the
old days is because it was against the
[SPEAKER_05]: law.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best I can say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't harm anybody, but when you take
and make a menu and you put nine strains
[SPEAKER_05]: on it and you create artwork and you ship
thousands of packs of seeds and then you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't get credit for it, you're gonna get
mad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why a lot of people think I'm a
dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I want is credit for the work I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that sound like an asshole?
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, we see a lot of the
strains that were formally released under
[SPEAKER_02]: TGA now under their respective breeders
individual line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that because you guys have kind of come
to an amicable conclusion in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: that, or is that because the contracts
ended?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to make those strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to make any of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I make my own strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not making or recreating anything
made by anybody that's ever made with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now in my new business, we process
cannabis under my like anything that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: ever processed under my label.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll process into hash or flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can go out and buy 50 pounds
of jelly bean and make hash out of it and
[SPEAKER_05]: sell jelly bean hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't you?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer to work with strains that I
worked with.
[SPEAKER_05]: If my name was on a pack, then I prefer to
sell that strain of dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of common sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think anybody would deny that
I helped develop this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as recreating it, breeding it,
that's not what I want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to make money off of
anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I want is one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man, the guy worked his ass off for
us.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's a chat room somewhere,
it's fucking melting down right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just me and you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was about to say, I think this is
going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is going to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this morning I was mad and I
wasn't going to come on, but I'm not a
[SPEAKER_05]: pussy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to dodge all these
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I went to the school of dank and
raised forty thousand dollars for jinx's
[SPEAKER_05]: organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I went back and did it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent my money on the hotel bills.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent my money on the weed, the seeds
and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm an asshole, I'm an asshole,
you know, but I'm pretty sure I was
[SPEAKER_05]: involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will take it even further.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmer John is one of my hash makers here
in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was talking to somebody the other
day, some somebody was online saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, and he said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking watched sub teach these people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched him take the fucking plant and
put it in place a by plant B and show
[SPEAKER_05]: teach.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he said it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, so I was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It made me feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he wasn't trying to start an
argument.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, so you did help these people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, thank you, John.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe a nice way to end up this
general thread would be just to say that
[SPEAKER_02]: many of the breeders who were formerly
under the label have gone on to obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve success in their own right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to make you proud seeing
as you were involved in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another thing is that a lot of the
work does have remnants of TGA lines you
[SPEAKER_02]: created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so surely it must be rewarding twofold
because, you know, you've helped them to
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve their own success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some of your own work embedded
within theirs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you something right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quantum Kush by Homegrown Natural Wonders
is the single most potent plant I've ever
[SPEAKER_05]: grown in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you should buy it from Odie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is fucking knock your dick in the
goddamn dirt pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: My time wrecked male was used to breed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was some controversy on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Dioxide grew out a 10 pack of
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is where the time wrecked plant
came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: I showed Joel how to pick the last male
plant that shows sex.
[SPEAKER_05]: I showed him the difference between a
cordage male plant and a sex plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: a excuse me, a drug recessive plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that plant went around and is still
used today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go buy Quantum Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll knock your fucking dick in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go buy Dr. Who.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: They both were created with a time wrecked
male.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to sound like a weird
question, but I heard this and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think there's any particular good spot to
slow it in, so I'm just going to slow it
[SPEAKER_02]: in right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that some bikeys came up to a TGA
booth at one of the cups and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: stop using the Hells Angels name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that is there any truth to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard that story?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any idea where it maybe comes
from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, troll rumors.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the Hells O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut doesn't belong to Hells Angels.
[SPEAKER_05]: They live right next door to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't give a shit about a cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: You break.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just to name Hells Apes name.
[SPEAKER_05]: They named it Harborside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not it's not nearly as deep
as you think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you something below your
mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: We lost the Hells O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut last year at one of our breeding
facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the eight thousand Jesus O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds that exist today, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so would you ever look to recreate it
or are you of the opinion if something
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of leaves like that, you just want to
move on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's my smart ass answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as it dies off, we'll find a new O
.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: male and we'll kill Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we make a new one,
we'll resurrect him.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: My new business is growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are now germinating one thousand Jesus
O.G.
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and finding the best two phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those phenotypes will be logged into
Phylos, Candor, testing labs be listed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trademark is our clone and protected.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that clone will be grown and sold
in dispensaries and my company name will
[SPEAKER_05]: go on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be grown under something called the
dank standard, which sets minimum for
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes, cannabinoids and sets a standard
for not having pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we test everything three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for for long, we hope that you'll
be able to go to a dispensary and buy a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis product that's in a nitrogen
filled box that was prepared by a
[SPEAKER_05]: professional that is the exact same
cannabis that you will buy in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon, Washington and California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way we can do this is we are
setting up these facilities in each state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm in Arizona now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a D.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can sell to all one hundred and thirty
one dispensaries and I can buy from one
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred and thirty one dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm setting the same thing up in Nevada
right now and also in northern California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we grow the cannabis in the facility
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The seeds are put out there, the clones
are put out there and we're not crossing
[SPEAKER_05]: state lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even change banks.
[SPEAKER_05]: The money from Colorado stays in a
Colorado bank and stays in a Colorado
[SPEAKER_05]: company.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was all formed by my partner,
T.J.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will and three lawyers who came up with
what they say is a landmark way of doing
[SPEAKER_05]: business instead of growing cannabis in
one area and shipping it to another.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to set a set of standards to
produce it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if you're watching me,
but we hit 96 percent THC today with CBD D
[SPEAKER_05]: .A.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know what the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are knocking the charts off with
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: This stuff was tested three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spent three thousand dollars testing
the cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're testing the extracts twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I'm doing this is because
Arizona specifically has no testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: no state testing and people are smoking
poo stew and avid and all kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go out and buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We test it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make sure that doesn't have mold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the cannabis we use the time of
selling cannabis with crap on it or grown
[SPEAKER_05]: and poorly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to go this medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not medicine for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people like to get really fucking
stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have an autoimmune system,
you need to make sure there's not shit on
[SPEAKER_05]: your weed and you make sure there's not
avid or SM 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a set of standards that we are
very proud to uphold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is we think is the new future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not see the seed business staying
where it was in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: The home of the five dollar grams here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many people in the world used to grow
cannabis because that's the only way to
[SPEAKER_05]: get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It ain't going to be very long at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be able to go to Wal-Mart
and buy weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be able to go into a
liquor store and buy weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Americans generally like to smoke
shitty pre rolls, not good canvas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the people who are going to grow
cannabis are the people like us that have
[SPEAKER_05]: a very serious passion for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a huge market of people who used
to grow recreational get weed will just
[SPEAKER_05]: buy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, growing weed is the hard work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of dedication.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they can go buy weed, I think the
seed business will fall off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's another thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clone business has taken off.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I started doing this, you had to buy
seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go buy a clone right now of all 40
of my strains in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can drive to Alpine Alternative and
buy the damn clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy the clone that I selected.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go get my time wreck that I grow
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why you need to buy a pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see a shift and that's why I'm
growing flowers now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, I made 12 new strains since my
house burned down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the old days, we were basically the
only seed company other than some
[SPEAKER_05]: Europeans and there was Cali Connection
and there was DNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 12 new seed companies every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The market's thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel though that part of the drive
people have to buy seeds is that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: almost a similarity between gambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very small risk, but maybe it'll be
a really big payoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that plays into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think the majority of people
know that their chances of getting
[SPEAKER_02]: something phenomenal from a pack of seeds,
obviously it improves with breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, you can get clone
onlys that will probably be better than
[SPEAKER_02]: what you get out of most packets.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's an unknown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys are going to laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to throw a number out there
and y'all can beat me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's probably 30%, 40%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up to seeds aren't ever grown out.
[SPEAKER_05]: People collect seeds like baseball cards,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some 2003 black Christian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably bad by now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my, no, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have guys that showed me their
collection on Instagram and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus, dude, you own $10,000 worth of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just gotta hope they pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with all, with all the things you were
just mentioning, it sounds very much like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of the general industry is
moving that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I wanted to mention though,
is that yourself and a few other companies
[SPEAKER_02]: do outsource some of their strain
reproduction to other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: This seems to be a growing trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that, do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel it's a growing trend and do
you feel there are any downsides of this
[SPEAKER_02]: practice?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are downsides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the wonderful things that my
track, he don't even make his own change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have 48 strains and there's not
possible to make 48 strains in one
[SPEAKER_05]: location.
[SPEAKER_05]: A, B, we operate in several different
locations, California, Arizona,
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you take the simple fact that we like
to keep one male in one location so that
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll mix it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last factor is talent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my breeder's name is Badger.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's probably one of the best growers I
ever met.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how he got that way?
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking hand trained him for three
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taught him every single thing I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now he lives in another place in a nice
building.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he does exactly what I taught him to
do with the exact same clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when he makes Jack the Ripper,
he makes it just like he did when he was
[SPEAKER_05]: in my basement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I change that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You with me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I take that incredible talent
away?
[SPEAKER_05]: He just created a strain called Queen
Anne's Revenge that has more resonance
[SPEAKER_05]: than I've ever seen in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_05]: He created it with passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a job for this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's fucking subcool's breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he happens to be my best friend and he
named his fucking son Montgomery,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is my name.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this isn't some shack in the middle of
a fucking field somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my fucking brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that makes it a little bit different
than outsourcing or genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else makes my genetics?
[SPEAKER_05]: A friend of mine named Northstar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known him for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: His house was the house I took a shower in
after my house burned down.
[SPEAKER_05]: His kids are my godchildren.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, outsource?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I talk to these people every single day
and he has 75 mother plants that no one
[SPEAKER_05]: else has.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we work with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who's seen Northstar's library or
he's in screen feed in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be able to work with Happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: To be able to call this guy up and say,
man, why don't you cross A times B?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we just go back to the storyline for a
moment, let's go back to I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: correct me if I'm wrong, I think it was
shortly after you moved to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this when you popped the packet of
Space Queen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and by the way, everybody thinks we
should stop calling it Space Bomb because
[SPEAKER_05]: nobody knows what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vic sent me a pack of Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I left the United States,
I left all my seeds at Danny's house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know where the hell I was going.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pack of Space Queen was taped
underneath the keyboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: This gets creepy.
[SPEAKER_05]: At Danny's wake, I had one of my friends
going to his office and get all the seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: and send them back to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Danny would not have wanted them to be
thrown away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cracked those seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that, we found Tiny Bomb,
which is a female Space Queen plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found C, which we call Cherry,
which we have since gotten rid of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found The Dude, which is our Space
Queen male.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call him The Dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's made over 60% of all our crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've taken he and all he does is cross
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one plant out of a billion for
real.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could cross it with a turnip and it
would get you out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we use him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also infuses a cherry flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a grape strain and you
cross out, cross sometimes this strain,
[SPEAKER_05]: it becomes a grape cherry strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we made Cuvée.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took a strain that tasted like
chocolate and crossed it with Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it tastes like cherries and chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuvée means to combine two things together
that are good to make one better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say the chocolate and cherries
are better than each one alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to try to set the record straight,
it's been alleged that the Space Queen was
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact a C99 back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the case?
[SPEAKER_05]: All I can tell you is Vic sent me a pack
of seeds that said Space Queen with an ink
[SPEAKER_05]: pen on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to ask Vic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe a different way to approach
this question and to kind of satisfy some
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to find out that it was say a
C99 back cross, would you want to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: try to rectify the information sources out
there?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never even heard that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vic sent me a pack of seeds in the mail
and he said they were Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pretty sure that's what they were.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm actually not aware of the C99.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess while we're on that general
topic, how do you feel about phylos and
[SPEAKER_02]: about the general kind of testing of
plants, finding out their origins?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a concept you're in favor of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that some people aren't in
favor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: We are mapping all of our mother plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're indicating a problem that my ex
actually talked about.
[SPEAKER_05]: During all of the testing that we sent in
to phylos, one time we actually made a
[SPEAKER_05]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we sent the stem of the same fucking
plant in each envelope.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've ever done a phylos
test kit, but you have to take a stem and
[SPEAKER_05]: you cut a piece of it off and you wash it
with alcohol three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how you get it there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy that did it for me made a mistake,
simply had six bags and he just put one in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they turned this into this huge thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, tried to destroy the
reputation of my company, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: cool being as the other person owns half
of the company, but it didn't work because
[SPEAKER_05]: we have two strains that are pretty
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love telling this story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one is called Cuvée.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's Pinot Noir time Space Queen,
which has a cherry flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's Tinto de Verano, which is
taste of summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Pinot times Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has a lemon taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those strains are easy to detect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you grow them out, they're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a friend named Eagle right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's grown out 45 of my strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking to him last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, well, what do you think of this
bullshit?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, well, I got Cuvée and it tastes
like chocolate and cherries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've won the cup here and I've got
your Tinto and it's lemon.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even funnier is everything can burn up
in the damn fire anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're logging our new mails other than
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I checked it again and it was right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've taken so much heat on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never actually told them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we made a mistake on the clipping that
was sent in, but not the resulting clone
[SPEAKER_05]: because the clone gets tested all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we test our strains that are made
with the clones, they test, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Go and file this and look, go look at Jack
the Ripper, go look at Jilly Bean,
[SPEAKER_05]: go look at all the strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people in the business wanted to turn
this into this huge thing because hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you can make stuff look like a dumb
ass, you can slow his business down and
[SPEAKER_05]: take his business.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends and my fans that grow my
genetics love them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shops here that grow Jesus and time
wreck, they laugh at this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They think it's the biggest internet joke
in the world, but it is something I had to
[SPEAKER_05]: address.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, that's the very bottom truth
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The space bomb we have, Jill's got a copy
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendo Dope just told the Corkle mail
because I Corkle mail burn up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's headed to Filo's right now to get
tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack the Ripper was pulled by 25 from
Badger.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got three males headed to Filo's
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to test three and catalog
three males and chase them to the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're rebuilding from the fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I think Filo's is a very
important mechanism, but I think the other
[SPEAKER_05]: problem with Filo's, if you actually go
right now to the Filo's galaxy as a layman
[SPEAKER_05]: and try the reader.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't understand it because I can't
understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to ask Nishan the owner and me
and Nishan are friends and he's been on
[SPEAKER_05]: the show and me and Filo's and
Subcoolzeeds are pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have all 30 of our moms and dads
cataloged by the end of the year,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they'll get a hologram certification
for our program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we take a clone into a shop or
something like that, we'll know exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: what it is because it'll carry
certification.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the stuff from the old days,
it won't be.
[SPEAKER_05]: like that anymore because we have open
source breeding like we've never had
[SPEAKER_05]: because we can look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys can go look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think everybody needs to get involved
and log their mails.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: God's pussy is logged into the Filo's
galaxy, by the way, and I can't change it
[SPEAKER_05]: because I didn't enter it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have misheard you, but I think you
said that you weren't going to get Space
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we hadn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, if so,
why was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking maybe I was going to say,
is it possible to maybe try to like
[SPEAKER_02]: propagate a clone from just a cutting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if so, I could understand why
you'd not want to send your prize mail in.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's another thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know now that we can actually take a
plant and bring it down to a cell cryo
[SPEAKER_05]: cloning, you know, and you can ship the
cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we could talk about this for
hours, but if you can take a plant down to
[SPEAKER_05]: a single cell and put it in a cryo or
shared ship it, you can ship a cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: That ain't a plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can move genetics nowadays.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you'd have to get a lawyer
involved to talk about the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as the ability, a fucking
heartbeat, you can ship a cell and a cell
[SPEAKER_05]: can be propagated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to be the new,
a new thing of cannabis is coming pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's cellulocloning.
[SPEAKER_05]: The clone is going to be able to be moved
around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see this coming in the next five
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did have another one or two questions
on Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to bash out before we move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the common sentiments I've heard is
that some people feel the repetitiveness
[SPEAKER_02]: of Space Queen across multiple different
strains can kind of just ultimately lead
[SPEAKER_02]: to, if you were to say, grow out a few
packets of TGA, you might find those more
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Queen phenos popping up
repetitively, which is obviously to be
[SPEAKER_02]: expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that is a little bit of a
detriment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the, if I were to say grow three
or four packs of TGA's, I could end up
[SPEAKER_02]: with say half of them being essentially
really similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not even close.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go in any dispenser in America and
look at all 40 strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in a Vortex is Apollo 13 times Space
Queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like baby puke and peaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a very pronounced sick,
sickly smell, but in a good way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack the Ripper smells like lemons.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pure lemons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuvée is also, these are all Space Queen
crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like chocolate with cherries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single one of them has a distinct
profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because the mother plants are
so strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can differentiate, I can take five jars
and differentiate from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, do all of my strains have a fruity,
pungent, pukey smell?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like goober's rag.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have a Kim D time Jack the
Ripper, which is brutal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like grease.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I started breeding, this is what I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grape, lemon, banana, lime, orange,
cherry, and melon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted a rainbow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I fucking did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, undeniably some very tasty weed,
which kind of brings us to another
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this one definitely depends on
kind of the lens in which you view the
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another kind of sentiment you commonly
hear from people is that TGA strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely tasty, but generally not the
most potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard this sentence?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would you respond to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would respond to the Jesus I ran today
for extract tested at 26% and dumped a
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking pile of crystalline like you've
never seen in your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I call bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I was going to, what I was
thinking was in a way though, I guess the
[SPEAKER_02]: other way to view it is even if,
even if you did kind of think,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, even if that's the case,
there's a certain niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the followup statement that people
will say is a lot of people I know really
[SPEAKER_02]: like the TGA strains because they're not
just going to like make you totally
[SPEAKER_02]: retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got a lot of flavor and you
know, it's a good, often a good,
[SPEAKER_02]: like this, this might lay me a bit of
heat, but it's like, it's good weed to
[SPEAKER_02]: like get people into maybe the more
obnoxious stuff, like the gassy stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like there is a market there
to feel like someone who's looking for the
[SPEAKER_02]: most tasty weed and you know, that's their
main criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were, you were really good at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there is a reason we have 48
strains on our menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, not everybody wants to smoke
Vortex and be scared shitless and puke on
[SPEAKER_05]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Matt rise did when he smoked a joint
with me, you can smoke a joint of chili
[SPEAKER_05]: bean and lay around and want to fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can smoke some coracle and kind of lay
around on the couch and just be mellow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all different.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, I mean, they're not just all
cannabis that we call it cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheesequake is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheesequake is in the 18 to 21% range
according to how you grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that doesn't blister your forehead or
make you scared, but it's got a nice
[SPEAKER_05]: Danish taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: It rolls around your tongue and the
Mercium in the, in the, from the coracle
[SPEAKER_05]: brings an overall calming to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so when you smoke it, you're relaxed,
but you're not scared shitless.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can focus like, like my Jack's
cleaner too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't type on Jack's cleaner too.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had to your vision blurs,
you can't see very well and you can't
[SPEAKER_05]: focus, but you take another strain of
mine, like third dimension, which is done
[SPEAKER_05]: in like 49 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a very coconut pineapple kind of
flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can smoke that shit all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't call it weak.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a different way of profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you say definitely has a lot of
truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I don't think cannabis is
all about just getting blasted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I get up in the morning,
love to smoke some of the, the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the more sativa mixed hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chili bean in the morning makes me laugh
and giggle and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, if you smoke vortex in the
morning, you wouldn't want to get in your
[SPEAKER_05]: damn car.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be going, why are they following me
and shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: So to me, cannabis is not just a medicine
and a recreation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I want to trip, then I'm going to
take something that's like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I want to listen to, you know,
Peter Frampton and lay around and make
[SPEAKER_05]: out, then I'm going to pick another kind
of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to me, cannabis is just all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, that's what we talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about the cannabis that actually
makes you smarter Apollo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never forget when I was making the
Apollo 13 BX, I'd be online typing and I'd
[SPEAKER_05]: be staring at a cursor.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you write, you know, that blinking
cursor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say, I'm going to smoke a
bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the next thing you would hear is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Typing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was literally, I was like, wow,
I can smoke one bowl of this Apollo 13 and
[SPEAKER_05]: start typing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think you can categorize any
cannabis is one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a really good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I did want to ask you is,
what do you think outside of, say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Dude and Space Queen would be a
strain that you think really nicely
[SPEAKER_02]: embodies TGA seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Quirkle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quirkle was a project.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Quirkle is, you know, somebody
called fake ass fake ass Urkel the other
[SPEAKER_05]: day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, we know it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know it's Urkel because it's just
tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same one that three of us use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Joel didn't even get his from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just happened to be the same plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I wanted when I made Quirkle was
a breeding point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted a way to a paintbrush of purple
and grape.
[SPEAKER_05]: Urkel's a female plant and I don't believe
in feminizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, well, what can I do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, what about if I out
cross or time Space Queen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then since Space Queen is cherry and
not colored and Urkel is grape and
[SPEAKER_05]: colored, as we look at the progeny,
we can see the variance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really fucking purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: In short, it's Urkel dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's really limey green and cherry and
tall, it's Space Queen dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also see the males.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not going to get into discussion
on male selection because that's another
[SPEAKER_05]: game.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see the Quirkle dominant males
and you can see the Space Queen dominant
[SPEAKER_05]: males.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to breed something and you
want to make it great, like we make,
[SPEAKER_05]: we just took him and we made great goo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we took an aft gooey and we crossed at
times a purple Quirkle male.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing actually gets purple leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a very great scent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very indica dominant and has a ton of
Mercium in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that male, we can control the flow
of the strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to take grape?
[SPEAKER_05]: Conversely, we also have a Quirkle male
that is a cherry flavor and produces more
[SPEAKER_05]: resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tends to make a strain less short.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tends to leg out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has larger trichome heads and the
trichomes themselves have a larger amount
[SPEAKER_05]: of liquid in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a grower breeder, these are traits I
can literally see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in order to make something,
I had to create Quirkle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to make a seed that would grow a
plant that was a male plant and that male
[SPEAKER_05]: plant would either give the attributes of
purple, grape, or cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how you control the breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to make Quirkle in order to make
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't make Cheesequake without making
Quirkle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Cheesequake's grown by everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's big and chunky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fun strain to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendo Dove loves growing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got 12 pounds on their outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I did was create a male plant and
then cross at times cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so using that formula, I can do it
times everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you have that you want me to turn
purple and give it a great flavor,
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can take something that's lemon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can make grape lemons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can take something that's cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can make grape cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if I want to make it more cherry,
I'd use the cherry male.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I lose you?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to take it all in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, a male plant is a paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the earliest kind of tips I
don't know if you'd call it a tip on
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, but I just I vividly remember it
from the Weednet episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you said it in a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said something to the effect of you
think that the male brings generally
[SPEAKER_02]: potency and the female brings more of a
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be getting that wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might get something wrong about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that holds generally true?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the male has the male, in my
opinion, provides cordage and structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also provides pest resistance with
nobody ever talks about the male plants
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, cannabis is depletious and the
male plant and the female plant are there
[SPEAKER_05]: for a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, when we feminize a
plant, man, I got lots of friends that do
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're presenting a slightly less quality
version.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that nature would always make a
better version or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: That hybrid vigor is what I've always
liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get it when you feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just always believe that you have to
work with the real male plant that has the
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 chrome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the mix with the other 10 on the
female.
[SPEAKER_05]: That takes a displacious training.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those genes mixed together and you get
the hardiness from the male plant with the
[SPEAKER_05]: potency of the female plant, with the pest
resistance of the male plant, with the
[SPEAKER_05]: resin production of the female plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fucking puzzle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's why it's called breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it ain't pollen chunking.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how you know what you're doing is you
make 97 strains and that's how many I've
made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think something which might jump
to mind for people who are paying
[SPEAKER_02]: attention is that the number you just
quoted is obviously a lot more than what's
[SPEAKER_02]: been at market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously you've culled some that
didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What for you is the process of deciding
whether a pack makes it to market?
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, a sentiment that I really
like was Bodhi said that he pops a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: pack, just a single 10 pack to kind of get
a feel for what the customer would
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he's not happy with that,
then he feels it's probably not good for
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sit on this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, about 12 years ago, we saw a problem
with people buying 10 packs of the shows
[SPEAKER_05]: for $120.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we created the five pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way we created the five pack is we
grew out tons of our strains of five
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to make sure we got a keeper out
of five seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the five pack theory didn't work,
my ass wouldn't be living in this house I
[SPEAKER_05]: paid for, because I'm a profitable
businessman.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the five pack sucked, we wouldn't
sell them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so yes, Bodhi's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have a customer get what he
wants out of that pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he doesn't get a representation out of
it, then he's not going to be a happy
[SPEAKER_05]: customer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And five's tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't get it, I'll usually replace
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it works all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So testing's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you don't know this, we grow a lot
of our strains ourselves, and then we send
[SPEAKER_05]: 1000 seeds into the ethernet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we watch, we watch Instagram,
and we watch Facebook, and we watch Roll
[SPEAKER_05]: It Up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they tell us that instantaneously,
you start hearing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a rumble.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you hear the opposite, yeah,
wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't look very good, which has rarely
happened in us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, they go the other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you mentioned something else,
culling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Culling happens a lot when you get busted.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been busted four times.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: We lost Danny Boy in a bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: We lose things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which leads to most of breeders nowadays
hold our clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Duke Diamond with Dominion Seed
Company, I'm sorry, just left Seoul.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has my Jax Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trichome Jungle Seeds in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has my Jax Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you talking about getting a clone
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: That took a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these clones are alive, and they'll be
there for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year, I'd like to take these clones
and get them into Fino Seed Bank,
[SPEAKER_05]: into their cryocellular thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that when I pass on, these clones or
these genetics are available for life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And me and Will are setting up a trust
that lasts 500 years, just so that this
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff will live on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, you just referenced Trichome
Jungle, a good friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more so a man near and dear to my
heart, Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually told me that you were the one
who put him in contact with Seoul,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that kind of led to the resurrection
of Brothers Grimm a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how did that all go about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just say the phone call from sub
cull carries a lot of fucking weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Scott's friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: He needs a job.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got a job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, love or hate me, if I call you on
the phone and ask you a favor,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're probably going to answer the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm probably going to have a good
reason for calling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably going to listen to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seoul.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tommy thanks me all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it certainly got them both launched
again on their own respective platforms,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is a good outcome
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I just wanted to loop back on
quickly, just as a bit of a pot question.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Space Queen was first released,
did it stand out to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it something which caught your eye?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it only really until you pop your
pack that you really kind of started to
[SPEAKER_02]: gain traction for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: To this day, the space bomb male we pulled
out of there is still Jill's favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: strain on the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That says a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, thousands of seeds we cracked that
one female.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plant is still our favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it stood out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still stands out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a quarter pound of tiny bomb grown
properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to believe it looks like pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's got so much resin on it and
smells so crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like, wow, this smells like
cherry candy and it's got sugar all over
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not even hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you stick it in super soil and you
harvest it at eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Duh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you top it, you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get two pounds of light every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess maybe what I'm kind of
getting at is do you think it had much of
[SPEAKER_02]: a following before you popularized it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so, because Vic was kind of
a cult kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Vic, you had to know Vic and Vic
was an asshole.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, Vic died last week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really sad to hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was this kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do it first a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a kid that's a kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a guy that hangs around in one of
my chats and he's pretty intelligent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I got to know him very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, he said, Vic's my uncle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, you bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me enough stuff that convinced me
that Vic was his uncle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was going to see him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he told me that he told Vic this up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Said hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he just started kicking and
that, you know, just all agitated and all
[SPEAKER_05]: pissed off.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, I don't think a lot of people know
his face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that that pack of seeds and
that mail is some magical ethos or
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I worked hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I took the strain and I made a
shitload of genetics and I ground my ass
[SPEAKER_05]: out for seven days a week for years and
years to where you actually heard about me
[SPEAKER_05]: and invited me on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think any business just like that,
it takes a person that works his ass off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why, you know, about Space
Queen, I don't think anybody else agrees
[SPEAKER_05]: with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, there's, there's 50 threads
right now on the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go sub cool gross Space Queen tiny
bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to sit and grow and write.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sit and grow and write.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as a personal question,
cause I would very much say to people that
[SPEAKER_02]: if I had to kind of attribute what my
influences are for this show, I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: out of a done show in the weed net.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got to ask what kind of inspired
you to start the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you had the passion for it,
but what made you decide to go,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to actually turn this into a
media format rather than just a written
[SPEAKER_02]: format.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've got to back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that, that thing that I talked
about, it's a little embarrassing that I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't feel like I belong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, talking to the camera made me feel
like I belong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I did the weed nerd cameras.
[SPEAKER_05]: We lived in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a little office.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't leave very often, you know,
chill dinner thing with the kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I stayed out there locked in the
garage and I didn't have anything to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I listened to music and I started the,
you know, the recorded weed nerd and I,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I had a lot of fun with it,
but the current weed nerd, which is the
[SPEAKER_05]: live show was inspired by the grow to
round table, crazy day go after my house
[SPEAKER_05]: burned down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at his house.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's let me stay at his house.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a couple of weeks and I'm Friday
night.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you do it live.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't record it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now as a problem, the old show,
I use music and a lot of the weed nerds
[SPEAKER_05]: can stick up.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's certain bands like don't ever play
food fighters, but you can play chili
[SPEAKER_05]: peppers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just learn this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play them off of YouTube and they
won't copyright it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you play food fighters off of
YouTube on a YouTube video, they will ban
[SPEAKER_05]: your account, which is what happened to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I'm going to go live
streaming, playing the new food fighters
[SPEAKER_05]: video on YouTube, off of YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they crushed the stream and they
killed my live stream for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: But having said that it, they go,
they go talk to me about the live stream
[SPEAKER_05]: and bubble man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble man's format is something that I
watched and I, I think it's stiffer than
[SPEAKER_05]: mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I yell fuck at my fans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I toss people out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the Howard Stern of my show.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's much more structured and classy,
but I will tell you for all the people
[SPEAKER_05]: that say I'm an asshole, my bands love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They pick on me and try to get me to throw
them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they try to get me to rant on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they ask me stupid questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll yell and holler at them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go, Oh, just fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a, it's a show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, I don't scream and yell fuck and
wrinkle like all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's, that's a show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've taken bubble man and crazy Dago and
Vader and Pagoli and mouse and other
[SPEAKER_05]: people like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've informed my own character and I'm
going to say it one more time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do it because I'm lonely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need human interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a self fulfilling thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I have 200 people watching me and
we're listening to music and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking, I would rather do that than watch
TV or read or just about anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of my position, it's kind of a
job too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I teach people how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I give free seats to any sick person that
needs them.
[SPEAKER_05]: No questions asked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I raise money for people who are sick and
that platform on, which is the weed nerd
[SPEAKER_05]: allows me to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think some, some of the critics and a
point, you know, brought up in the thread
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it seems to be unclear how much of
the work was done by you and how much of
[SPEAKER_02]: the work was done by miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people seem to think she doesn't
get enough share of the credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's truthful?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, is there any, do you want to
kind of give her credit for some things
[SPEAKER_02]: and like make it clear that that's what
she did or it was it all by you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not speak about Jill.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the middle of a brutal divorce
revolving around millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't speak about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I noticed myself was that
Jilly Bean, Jilly Bean has kind of got a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a cult following around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's because both the orange and
the mango of both the parents meld
[SPEAKER_02]: together well, but at the same time,
I think it's also because there's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of, you know, a shroud of mystery
around orange velvet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you willing to comment on orange
velvet at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you, do you think it is skunk and
why do you think Jilly Bean is such a
[SPEAKER_02]: successful strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not comment on Jill or Jilly Bean
in this interview.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the rumors that has been going
around was that at some point,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Jack's cleaner mail was
supposedly lost in a space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quinn took its place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, yeah, that's the phylos sample
I told you about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the current TGA setup appears to have
Jill in Oregon, you in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the plan to go forward with both of you
contributing under the same TGA banner?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't answer that question, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can, I'll make a statement if you want
to make me laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I own Subcool Seeds and Subcool.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is mine outright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Jill share ownership of TGA and I
can't, I don't know what will happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I hope is that Jill will be
incredibly successful and make Jilly Bean
[SPEAKER_05]: and make Agent Orange and make tons of
strains and help tons of people and be
[SPEAKER_05]: happy and find happiness in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just before you expressed that you
weren't particularly into the idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to imagine there's a pretty
decent demand for some FEMS from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever consider it or are you just
not looking to do it?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's, it would, it's, number one,
I don't believe in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if you know there are
companies that make $50 million a year
[SPEAKER_05]: selling seeds to Morocco, feminized seeds
to make ash.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're certainly on the table for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been offered it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly don't believe in making a
billion seeds to send over to Morocco to
[SPEAKER_05]: make ash out of them because they don't
care that they're hermaphrodite or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not my game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two things happened in my breeding career
and they would not have happened without
[SPEAKER_05]: Joel of North Star Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to make sure I give him credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we created Deadlights.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with Deadlights, it's 26, 27,
28% CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit what anybody says
about me at 56 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: I offer a strain that is above 27% CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, I didn't think I've ever
heard of CBD that high really.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of years we had to make penny
wines.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to get the ACDC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to back cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a test.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to lose a penny wise mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to refire it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A house burned down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to, I mean, it's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I told you before, work is work.
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now I have Deadlights and
Deadlights test over and over above 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can literally go Google the shit
or Instagram or whatever you surf it and
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll find a right now lab reports above
27%.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one on my phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that is success.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that prison terms and trolls
and hates and divorce and everything
[SPEAKER_05]: that's gone on, I created a strain that
helps people heal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing we haven't talked
about is charity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I give away so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, I have a nice car.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nice things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work really hard, seven days a week,
18 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last night I was up till 2.30 and I got up
at six this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't accuse me of not working.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you ask me for something,
I will give it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need something, I will give it to
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you ask me kindly, I would give any
human being anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kids, poor people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're turning the pool room into
RSO.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you didn't know, my giant pool full of
weed, we're going to turn it into RSO and
[SPEAKER_05]: give it the fuck away here in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really nice sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of people will benefit from
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to ask though, what's with the
pool?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, beyond the obvious,
like, is it just to prove a point at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm having a blast, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a pool in my house with like 30
pounds of weed in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a stereo.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go hang out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get our beach chairs and we smoke bowls
and we look at the weed and we teach
[SPEAKER_05]: people how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a dab bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come over and get high at my dab
bar and we can talk about the bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the story is true.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I moved in here, I have Alpha 1,
which is a progressive fatal lung disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the lungs of a 105 year old man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't breathe at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't walk upstairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't carry bags of concrete.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't do a lot but talk and yell at
people and point my finger at things
[SPEAKER_05]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's just something I have to
deal with, you know, of having Alpha.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that has formed almost everything I do
in life.
[SPEAKER_05]: The not being able to get around and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of how I ended up where I'm
at now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just something you deal with on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, anyone who follows your stream
would see, you know, you post regularly of
[SPEAKER_02]: the infusions you have to have to keep on
top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that that's helping you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember, and maybe you can
clarify this for me, it was probably two
[SPEAKER_02]: or three years ago now, maybe a little
less even.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that you were saying that just
even generally smoking, it was really
[SPEAKER_02]: quite irritating for the lungs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, you know, forgive me if I'm
mistaken, I think I see you puffing every
[SPEAKER_02]: now and again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think things are a little better
than what they were a while ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like any, is that due to the medication
or?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a great story and leads me into,
I wanted to tell a story here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I was diagnosed, they told me I
should never smoke again because I had
[SPEAKER_05]: lung disease and I quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And within a couple of weeks, I'm a very
nervous person.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bought some wine and I drank it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had me a glass and a corkscrew and I
bought wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought cheap wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought expensive wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking hated it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bought some beer one day and I liked
beer and I drank beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I drank alcohol, Ciroc,
specifically a couple of fifths a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I turned my life into a toilet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one day, I decided, I said,
well, fuck man, I'm killing myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should smoke weed again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I started smoking weed,
even though the doctors told me not to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I smoke only hash, generally teeny,
teeny hits and a little bitty pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't dab overheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a specific way of smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost a vaporizing method I do with
my pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: But within a couple of weeks of doing
that, I was able to quit drinking and quit
[SPEAKER_05]: doing drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I became my old self.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt normal again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I smoke hash in spite of the fact that
I'm not supposed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody with a lung disease should smoke
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am a miserable fuck when I don't
smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a hateful, mean asshole.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I smoke cannabis and that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, that's been a year in my life
off of cannabis and my, when I was sick
[SPEAKER_05]: and it sucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the reason I can do better now is I
moved out of Northern California.
[SPEAKER_05]: The weather in Northern California was
crushing me on the humidity, all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dry here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got lost cause I'm a little high.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I drained the pool because alpha one
sucks and the moisture was making it hard
[SPEAKER_05]: for me to breathe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I drained the pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was standing around the pool one day
and somebody on Instagram said,
[SPEAKER_05]: remember Cheech and Chong?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course I remember Cheech and
Chong.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Iguana gun, I can recite the movie.
[SPEAKER_05]: So somebody said, you should grow weed in
the pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said, yeah, we should.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we built a floor and we started and
somebody said, 300 people comment,
[SPEAKER_05]: either I was a genius or I was the dumbest
redneck in history.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I took that as a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't grow weed in the pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're growing weed in a pool and we're
sponsored by Smart Pots and Hortilux and
[SPEAKER_05]: Solitech and Method Seven and Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody on the fucking planet knows
Subcool's got a pool full of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's another part of what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole craziness like, like I'm going
to tell you something about your thread
[SPEAKER_05]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That little thing you put up at your
avatar.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was there?
[SPEAKER_05]: 170 comments, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking about me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't matter what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All publicity is good publicity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys want to keep it up,
when you log on to a thread and 160 times
[SPEAKER_05]: type my name, I probably sold a whole
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Loaded stuff today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of on that topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it like to have the TGA brand
extending into the European market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find the demands are different or
the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the thing that I've seemed to
notice from my very limited interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: with the European market is they tend to
be more focused on the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with that being said, I would
imagine TGA does fairly well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say that, and God, I got out of
habit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Subcool seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually changed the name of the company
and I own Subcool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Subcool strains are, yeah,
there's, there's a reason your buddy with
[SPEAKER_05]: Tricone Jumble seeds grows some of my
gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he likes the turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason that some of the hash
makers use my stuff because they like the
[SPEAKER_05]: weird comical cherrygasm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know about cherrygasm?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes white rosin that crystallizes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes out and it'll turn in those
little THCA crystals.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you press it, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like cherry sap.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this side of having an orgasm to take
a hit of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we call it cherrygasm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have friends that come in my house and
they're just like, as a matter of fact,
[SPEAKER_05]: when I moved here, there was a guy that
was making sugar wax.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought all he had at full retail.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, can I taste that?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I said, Jesus Christ,
man, it tastes like smoking candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I have more?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just one strain cherrygasm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, we lost cherrygasm in the
fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scotty016 was nice enough to bring the
cherry pie OG back to Joel.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has the space dude mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just released cherrygasm again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you, fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't no fire going to take me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the claims I've seen raised by
critics is that, I mean, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: let me put it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've made it clear that certain strains
were discontinued because the mothers were
[SPEAKER_02]: gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the case that pretty much all the
discontinued strains fall under that
[SPEAKER_02]: umbrella?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or were some of them pulled from the
market because there were issues that
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't realized until after release?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've never had an issue with a strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had strains that were better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like Pandora's box, we took Pandora's
box off the menu because it's a back cross
[SPEAKER_05]: of JTR.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to JTR.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'm going to bullshit you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you grew JTR and you grew Pandora's
box, you'd be like, yeah, these things are
[SPEAKER_05]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That Pandora's box right there is a lot
like that Jack the Ripper female.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all it is is a more stabilized
version.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we took it off the menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: We just brought it back on the menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to know why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because 10 times a week, somebody goes,
bring that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack's Cleaner Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried for five years to make a blueberry
flavored strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I grow blueberry in super soil,
it pushes it in hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to think that blueberry was a
hermaphrodite strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've taken heat on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a low feeding strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you put it in super soil, you push it
all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only know that now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kept working with it and I kept
trying to create something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought I was creating herms because
fucking males kept messing up and the
[SPEAKER_05]: females kept messing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I spent five years trying to do one
thing and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took the Space Queen male, crossed it
times Jack's Cleaner and we made Jack the
[SPEAKER_05]: Ripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can say what you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Jack the Ripper tested 6% for THCV
and you can't go in and shop here and not
[SPEAKER_05]: buy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say it was a successful cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I'm always interested in is
deeply embedded within that cross is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pluton genetics, which I remember you told
the story and I think you said that your
[SPEAKER_02]: friend sent you some of the working parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think you actually work
specifically with the Pluton.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think that that comes through
it all in the cross or do you think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a structural like, you know,
like it's embedded in there, but you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: see it particularly?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jack's Cleaner is heavy on
Northern Lights so that the story is,
[SPEAKER_04]: my friend Scoosh, who passed away two
years ago, by the way, all my friends are
[SPEAKER_05]: dying because we're all old, but Scoosh,
excuse me, Scoosh sent me a 100 Scoosh
[SPEAKER_05]: scoosh scoosh scoosh seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Northern Lights times Pluton.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that thing you see me type.
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern Lights time Pluton time Hayes
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's what he sent me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he told me it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I grew them out and I got this
amazing female plant call cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was the best female out of a
hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the females out of that pack were
shite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they were just were, they weren't
any good.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time I had a major fascination
for Jack hair and I had grown out a pack
[SPEAKER_05]: of Jack hair from Sensei seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked the last female to excuse me,
the last male to show sex and I pollinate
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made Jack's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time I was heavy into drugs,
steroids, fast cars, women, cocaine,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I lost the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea where they were,
but that Jack's cleaner female was giving
[SPEAKER_05]: us a couple of friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I got my shit back together,
it stayed around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I passed it out to everybody that could
get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Soul passes out his A13 so
people don't lose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who do you think some of the breeders
who still around now, but maybe just
[SPEAKER_02]: largely go unnoticed by the masses?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there is such a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're all players now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kyle Cushman has a giant contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke has a giant contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul has a giant contract with Cinderella.
[SPEAKER_05]: He grows cannabis and sells it across the
nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a little statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was only one Snoop Dogg and there
was only one Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of pot growers and that's
what you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to see people aligning
themselves with someone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have four felonies and everybody knows
who I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really easy for these guys to
come and pick me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And trust me, they know all this drama
that revolves around me and the divorce
[SPEAKER_05]: and Jill and all the things that happened
to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they fucking laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go, I must've heard Subcool's name 35
times today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why they picked me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul has the same power.
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke, I mean, tell me you wouldn't want
Duke Diamond breeding for you and putting
[SPEAKER_05]: his name on some strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's what you're going to
see moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone that has done anything of fame is
going to align themselves with a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, Kyle just got a massive contract
with Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's going to be the Hydrofarm
spokesman.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fuck does that have to do with growing
pot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He likes Hydrofarm lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's going to tell people they're good
lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do the same thing every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a big sign hanging in my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a new, the branding thing,
the aligning thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The outlaws, those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just are.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a time of paying taxes and
businesses and working with other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We work with a greenhouse here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We buy their cannabis and we sell our
products at their store.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've collaborated together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're putting all their bud tenders in our
uniforms and some of our people in their
[SPEAKER_05]: uniforms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the only way you can move forward
in this industry is to work with people
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can get along with and pump it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Saturday.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to drop our sauce for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: 96% THC isolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: With CBDA, whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got nine pound hammer, Jesus,
and girl time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've pre-sold a couple of hundred units
and we're going to show up at 11 o'clock
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm going to sign books.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pass out things and we'll be
friendly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is working.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a form of work that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have like a Willy Wonka thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody gets a box and whoever gets the
special box gets a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dink books are almost gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I have 12 left and that's the
only ones left.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, give some pipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you just give some cool stuff away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give a fan the experience because for as
much hard-ass questions as you have asked
[SPEAKER_05]: me today, when I go in public,
people still walk up to me and treat me
[SPEAKER_05]: with massive respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: People shake my hand and they thank me for
teaching them how to grow and teaching
[SPEAKER_05]: them how to maybe buy a house or pay their
taxes or do something right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I enjoy what I do very, very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very rewarding to have so many
people, you know, look up to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you how many people say,
Hey man, you told me how to make Supersoul
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you taught me how to clone and I
own a seed company now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so many people and I'm not trying to
take extra credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you catch me right now tonight after
the show in my stream and you ask me a
[SPEAKER_05]: question about growing, I won't answer it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I noticed in the past you had done
some kind of seminar things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You even referenced it in regards to the
Jinx charity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you plan to do any more of these going
forward?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, my health really, I really shouldn't
go around a ton of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I get a cold, like if I get a cold or
flu because I got on a plane or travel,
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_05]: So alpha is not a joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody wants to Google alpha one,
it's the progressive fatal lung disease
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's brutal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, getting a cold is not good for
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people that have what I have die
because they get a virus or a flu.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't fly all over the place and I
don't generally, I didn't go to Cush Talk
[SPEAKER_05]: this weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope there are people listening that
know about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, sub said he was going to
Cush Talk and he fucking let us down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I wanted to go so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really did.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fucking smoky ass building seven hours
away, fucking hot as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been detrimental to my
health.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way I can stand in a hot ass
dusty building, breathing smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so at the last minute I bailed and
people think I'm being wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, I was like, Oh God, I want to go
be sub cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I please go stand in public and pass
out seeds and have people shake my hand
[SPEAKER_05]: and pat me on the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I made the choice not to high times in
San Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been invited to be a judge there
and I've been invited to be a judge at
[SPEAKER_05]: Chalice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been invited to speak at both
places and we may do Chalice, but on the
[SPEAKER_05]: 20th, me and we'll have a grand opening.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're dropping sauce and 12 dispensaries
here in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't really have time to go talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can watch me talk 40 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: A week.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to watch, turn the phone on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just if we look back on that point you
made about how you guys market and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you would be a good person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask this question too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not referring to anyone specific,
but do you think it's possible for a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder in today's age to produce quality
work, but not be particularly present on
[SPEAKER_02]: social media?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's going to work or it just
won't be viable in this current scene?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's a really interesting
question because there are certainly
[SPEAKER_05]: breeders around that don't, you know,
rip up social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, like my favorite,
one of my favorite breeders right now is
[SPEAKER_05]: Bodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen his camera work on
Instagram?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all the tobacco and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: The resin heads and stuff he does,
he's just out of control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you, how do you sell your strains
if you don't tell people about them?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you sell the donuts if you don't
tell people you got good donuts?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think there are people working
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one Badger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Badger is probably one of the best
breeders in America today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you even know who he is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely know who he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he on social media?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of have to almost if that makes
any sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, just most notably having had
a chat with Gooey Breeder, I kind of think
[SPEAKER_02]: of him in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he maybe limits himself a bit by
being so absent, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he doesn't make any money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not dogging to Gooey.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got money.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a very successful, wealthy person.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounded wrong the way I said it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But does he have 45 strains on the market
selling them in every dispensary and every
[SPEAKER_05]: shop?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does he have a strains and attitude?
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, it's because nobody knows about
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know about him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and you know about him because you know
Joel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know his stuff is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's an eclectic kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only met him twice in hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I live down the street from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Closer than you would have thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good reference, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gooey is a hell of a breeder that people
don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I wanted to quickly bring up,
this one you may or may not have heard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I remember you first talking about
Super Soil, I'm pretty sure the cook time
[SPEAKER_02]: has always been about three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I swear it's like a competition
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hear people saying, you know,
like six weeks, eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just feel like it's going to be
somewhat detrimental to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that reducing that cook time
is detrimental to the plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so eight weeks is really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six, eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, if it doesn't, if you don't break
down, especially if they're using if
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not, if they're using glacial rock
dust, which some of the recipes people
[SPEAKER_05]: still use that that does not break down.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're using Leonardo, it's a little
slower.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple of things in the mix that
takes a little longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have something we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's completely different here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We keep six cans made.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we drop three cans, we keep six.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you that I happen to know that
that Jill runs nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we keep them full all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say most of our Super Soil is
approaching two months of age.
[SPEAKER_05]: People think it goes bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil is not going to go bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember the gnat thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you leave it outside for too long and
it gets moist, you can make a breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: sanctuary for gnats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two inches of neem crake across the top
will prevent that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good advice, good advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I saw in that thread
today, someone wanted to know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how come you were banned from Breed Bay?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't actually know any of the context
to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just going to be totally all new
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, Pistols was my friend and we
sold stuff and he had kind of a beef with
[SPEAKER_05]: my ex.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never really got along.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the end, he owed me $90,000 and he
basically, you know, he's overseas paying
[SPEAKER_05]: me drafts and he let it get up and I was
hitting him on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one more order and it got too
high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I basically, he said, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not paying you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he banned me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, is that a common thing dealing
with seed banks nowadays or is that a
[SPEAKER_02]: thing in the past?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Logic, what is Logic on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one is Logic on?
[SPEAKER_05]: God, it's one of these forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: He at 420 something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, he, he, he tried to get me,
but I tricked him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tricked him into paying me by telling
him I was going to send him another order
[SPEAKER_05]: and didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got two other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody left his site.
[SPEAKER_05]: His site still runs and he still does
business with new people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess he doesn't rip people off anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, when you're dealing with an email,
what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck off.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to scream and you're going to
holler and you're going to start a war on
[SPEAKER_05]: the internet that turns into some big
drama and nobody knows the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what do you do if me and you
establish business and I just tell you to
[SPEAKER_05]: fuck off?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, your name's Red Baron and my
name's Subcool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean Logic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How the hell am I supposed to collect from
some guy named Logic?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's part of the business, which is why
some of the people that we work with,
[SPEAKER_05]: like Ed Borg of Delta 9, a 22 year
relationship, Hemp Depot, 19 year
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship attitude, 14 year
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work with people you're going to trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other criticisms I've heard
from people is that I think it's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: true that at one point you were definitely
one of the main breeders on attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like you've done very well on it
historically.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I heard was that you had a lot of
influence over attitude and who got to
[SPEAKER_02]: vend on that site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any truth to that or do you want
to comment on that at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there when there was only a few
breeders and so I made a ton of fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the guy going to the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't anybody else really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had like a couple of people and then
they start picking people up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to realize I was there before Big
Buddha.
[SPEAKER_05]: My first high times cup, I stood ass cheek
to ass cheek with Big Buddha at a three by
[SPEAKER_05]: three table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Him behind me, he's selling his cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was selling Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean we all kind of started from the
same roots, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it like to deal with these
international banks now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still have these issues like what
you mentioned with Logic or is it a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more business like nowadays?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we actually have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a business in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I own a business in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a bank account there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a facility there and so I own a
business in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not the same thing as it used to
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean Will can go there and visit Ed's
office.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not smoke and mirrors anymore if that
makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's a business, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: You open up a business, you do business,
you run the money through the banks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this man's name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Name, address, tax ID number.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a, oh by the way there's another
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're lucky I didn't make you sign an
NDA and I'm laughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But me and Will have a stack of
non-disclosure agreements sitting next to
[SPEAKER_05]: us.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you come in my house and we're going to
talk business, you're going to sign that
[SPEAKER_05]: shit because if you talk shit down the
road, I'm going to bust your ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another part of this business is
people can't keep their fucking mouth
[SPEAKER_05]: shut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can totally understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And nowadays the people that we're talking
to come with NDAs and now we're having an
[SPEAKER_05]: NDA dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to sign my NDA and Will,
Will by the way, one of the smartest
[SPEAKER_05]: contract people I've met in the likes of
the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: He read this one guy's thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, why aren't you signing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause his contract says if we have a
dispute, we have to go to fucking New
[SPEAKER_05]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not signing that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the guy bought it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, why won't you sign mine?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, cause we're not going to dispute
the shit where you live.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he signed ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a better NDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to give a little bit of credit to
my friend who I have actually forgotten
[SPEAKER_02]: his name, but he helped me with this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically in one of the old weed nerd
episode, weed nerd episodes, apologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You asked the fan for suggestions of a
strain name and eventually the suggestion
[SPEAKER_02]: of electric watermelon hash plant came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in then kind of the next episode,
you said, oh, we can't use that because
[SPEAKER_02]: that one's already in use.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, a lot of people will point out
that there's a few strains from the TGA
[SPEAKER_02]: stables, which have taken names of already
existing strains like deep purple from
[SPEAKER_02]: Jordan of the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as strawberry daiquiri from sure
fire seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that, you know, like you do
try to avoid this overlapping of the names
[SPEAKER_02]: being taken?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it something you're aware of?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the old days, it was easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the old days you made up a name and it
wasn't taken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I started doing this, there was no
such thing as the name of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can name anything we want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can name it dump truck motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now the other day, this is a great
example.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Joel just released a strain to me
called great goo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I typed the fucking thing into Google
and it comes up all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I changed the name of this tester to Af
Groovy and Joel calls me goes,
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's fucking it's great goo.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I said, well, no great goo is he
goes, no great goo is just names and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no verified genetic heritage and
we're keeping the name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, I would rather not.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other part of it's kind of,
I'm pretty sure my deep purple was before
[SPEAKER_05]: Jordan's.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was aware of the strawberry daiquiri.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I grew the strawberry daiquiri out,
uh, the plant out and it has to be
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberry daiquiri.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it has to be it's Kyle Cushman's
strawberry cough times the THC Jack the
[SPEAKER_05]: Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it tastes like a fucking strawberry
daiquiri.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, wasn't aware of it until I had
already tested it under those names.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I looked it up, I said, well,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are only so many names to go around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one's going to be somebody else's
strawberry daiquiri.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one's going to be sub cool
strawberry daiquiri.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a decision because there are just
only so many names left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every stoner on the planet has sat around
smoking weed and put cheese times,
[SPEAKER_05]: but whole times Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just nothing left.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a strain called
thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a strain called dog shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's 12 strains with the watermelon
name in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, at first really tried now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I definitely wanted to ask
you before I forgot was I noticed in one
[SPEAKER_02]: of your posts, you said that the,
I can't pronounce it, but you did it
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the pinot noir or something along
those lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you said, yeah, it's your favorite
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's from aficionado or at
least this is what the post said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us some information on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I couldn't find much at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a clone only strain that Leo and
Frenchie work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have lost theirs.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only copy of it was at my house two
nights before the fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Frenchie was at my house, the night making
hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, Frenchie take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Oh, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to meet the doves house to meet
smash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, okay, Leo there was next day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey bro, what's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, man, take this clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, man, I'm going to the bay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, we'll swing back by and get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he didn't burn up in the fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Leo says he has a line on it,
but right now we do not have a line on it,
[SPEAKER_05]: which means we can't make coupé and we
can't make team tow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're my two favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to call Leo as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all also understand when I call Leo,
he's busy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got 300 acres and he's growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while he loves me and cares about me
and wants to help me, he's busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hadn't heard from him in four weeks,
three days ago, he sent me a text that
[SPEAKER_05]: said, sub, I have a line on the clone and
I'll be contacting you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I texted him back and he never even
responded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Busy is busy, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting when we speak about
aficionado because in the, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the infamous thread we reference,
one of the very obscure points brought up
[SPEAKER_02]: was that someone felt that TGA genetics
were overpriced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget that for just one moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to consider that in contrast to
aficionado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you think that that statement
holds any weight when you've got people
[SPEAKER_02]: admittedly?
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean a $300 wooden box?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think my proceeds are
overpriced.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love Leo to death, but I sell seeds
for $40 and that's a very reasonable
[SPEAKER_05]: price.
[SPEAKER_05]: We pay $2 to manufacture them and we,
what happens is, the attitude turns around
[SPEAKER_05]: and sells them for $160.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever consider trying to impose
some type of ceiling on your prices where
[SPEAKER_02]: you say, look, I just don't ever want it
going above this level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel it's a bit excessive at that
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the industry did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crockett was standing at a Kush talk this
weekend, his self selling 13 seeds for
[SPEAKER_05]: $50.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're about to see the price of seeds
take a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that's just going to drive
out the small time producers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you got to keep up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh, I mean, that shot shocked me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually came over to my book,
to our booth and talked to our people and
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Crockett.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, I mean, all I'm saying was it's
tough out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This man was standing there selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 13 seeds for $50.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's a really good deal for
Crockett seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the old days we'd go to an event and
we'd make $200 thousand dollars at Kush
[SPEAKER_05]: talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: We made $2,200.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think I'm going back?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus you can buy a pack of seeds on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the fucking Domino's pizza guy bring
you a pack of seeds nowadays.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is become silly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can Uber fucking weed to your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't really have to do the other
things we used to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can have somebody bring a
pizza and a bag of pot to your house here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can probably swing by and get your
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had heard rumors that Agent Orange was
possibly used in the creation of Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had you heard anything along those lines?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, I'll comment on that for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Eric 77 brought us California orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: California orange is used by me to create
things in the old days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's used by DNA to create things and
orange velvet is California orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the same cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our cut came from some people and it was
called Melvin and we thought Melvin was a
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking stupid name and it smelled like
oranges.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's orange velvet, but they're all
California orange and they came from Eric
[SPEAKER_05]: 77 in Gainesville in 1979.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard that a lot of it is very
much just Calio dominant expressions,
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that we'll see the orange
trend come back or do you think it's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of peaked and we'll, you know,
we won't see it again for a while?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so over orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never smoke it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you won't see me making it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what type of flavor profiles are you
looking to move on to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Chocolate, cherry, banana, and watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some pretty unique ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking kind of individually or
more blending them all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just those who remember that rainbow
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm still on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got cherry and now we lost Pino,
but we had chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I made chocolate weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made chocolate weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask any of my fans what Kuve tastes like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tastes like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just, it's a flavor thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I, I tasted some Brandon with
third gen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought a gram of something from Morgana
can last year called melons with a Z
[SPEAKER_05]: melons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Jesus was licking the lick in the
jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so some of the best tasting turp I
have ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was real.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm chasing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where the turp is the cherry turp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is the cherrygasm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A new one we have is a Nepali queen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Nepali has this really hashy,
grapey, old school, like old dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you went and bought a bag
of dank, when you were a kid, that old
[SPEAKER_05]: funky incense smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the Nepali and that's one of
Joel's man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's old clone that we brought out a new
and lemon Stilton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: He took a JTR and he crossed it with a
cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get the.
[SPEAKER_05]: T H C V pain killing effect with the pain
killing effect of cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you know this,
but people who have rheumatoid arthritis
[SPEAKER_05]: swear by cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't tell you why.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scientifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know much old vets that are beat
the shit in back and they love cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you mix it with that JTR,
you get an additional pain killing effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: T H C V acts on the CB2 receptor and CB2
receptor is responsible for your
[SPEAKER_05]: autoimmune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can stimulate the autoimmune
system, you can help heal yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why T H C is so important and
it's very rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since we discovered it in 5% in the
Jack the Ripper, you see a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: running Jack the Ripper looking for a male
in the hundreds of seeds, trying to find
[SPEAKER_05]: that, that rare JTR male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can definitely agree on the
stimulating the immune system idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big believer of that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am interested to know, do you have
any theories?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you may have said you do on where
those watermelon turps lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they seem to be the most kind of the
most, you know, they're just being exposed
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm sure they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't yet been able to try them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think they come from
genetically?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but there's a strain called
Goji and it tastes like watermelons and I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't even know where it's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just, this is a internet research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gotta go try to find Goji.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I don't even know what it is or
anything about it, but I understand it has
[SPEAKER_05]: a watermelon turpentine, but I will have
to say something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to stagger you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not currently breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a very unique program here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now I'm at 24 Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get a piece of card.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get 36 on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to 48 and eventually we'll have 60
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we moved in, I can only had 12
plants, which is why I have fucking eight
[SPEAKER_05]: giant plants in my pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't grow the number of plants that
I would grow in the pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we grew big fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine unless the pool project is
the most successful experiment in life,
[SPEAKER_05]: those things will get torn down and we'll
go back to the standard four, 10 gallon
[SPEAKER_05]: pots under a 1000, where we get almost
three pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've seen the pool, we've
employed these special cages called grow
[SPEAKER_05]: efficient cages, steel frames,
five by five.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this gentleman says strain specific,
we can get five pounds a piece and that
[SPEAKER_05]: would be 40 units.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm skeptical, but if we get that,
we may just continue growing the big trees
[SPEAKER_05]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's fucking fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of our viewers love to get the
kind of growers tips from our guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our viewers also organic,
which is going to work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, you're, you're speaking to
the choir.
[SPEAKER_02]: What type of things do you like to
supplement your super soil plants with?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you mentioned teas earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some general tips you might have
for us?
[SPEAKER_05]: So last year we started making our own
teas, um, which we got great results for
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of what we call a low till.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have a super soil with lasagna
tech, lasagna tech is crab meal and then
[SPEAKER_05]: alfalfa and different things in between
with a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have teamed up with the dragon fly
earth nutrient company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I have to tell the whole story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the old days, they sent me some and
I didn't, I didn't take it serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I joked around at all, hippie crap,
and I didn't take it serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually burned my plants cause I
didn't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we, we had them on the show and
they were such nice people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, well, these people are really
nice people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to pay attention and stop being an
ass hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I paid attention and I got to know
their company and they sent us,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, a large amount of products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're feeding the super soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we've been in veg for 14 weeks now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, and this is not your standard
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been using the luscious green and
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also use the, we did fuller last night,
um, which leads me to a crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to get back to the tips,
but check this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that if you use fuller spray,
that your micros testing in a lab are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to test above 10,000 and based on
new regulations in Washington,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon, and Colorado, that would fail the
test for natural, by the way, cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: cannot be organic because organic is a
word of the FDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a federal term.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is no such thing as organic
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's natural cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a real definition in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really like the idea of using
beneficials, but if you spray stuff on
[SPEAKER_05]: your plants in certain areas, you may not
pass the lab test because they can't
[SPEAKER_05]: differentiate between bad micros,
which would be shit and good micros,
[SPEAKER_05]: which would be like bacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that's a really important point.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people in those areas may not be
aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess maybe a question which immediately
jumps to mind is, do you know if there
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a rough cutoff time if you used
it in veg?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't use it in flour or by a certain
week of flour, stop using, or do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just a bit unknown at this point?
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we just learned this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sounding awful smart because a lab
scientist stood there and talked to me for
[SPEAKER_05]: about 40 minutes just three days ago,
or I wouldn't sound nearly as smart.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we found out is some really good
cannabis that we looked at testing at
[SPEAKER_05]: 90,000 joules or jazz or whatever the hell
it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CFUs, thank you CFUs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were smarter than me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, but it was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at 90,000 under these new regulations,
it would immediately be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't understand the difference
between good beneficials and bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's one of the things that
the weed nerd is, you know, I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing shows on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been teaching the growers and one of
the things I can use my platform is to
[SPEAKER_05]: send information out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've already been teaching the world
that they're trying to ban organic growing
[SPEAKER_05]: because the simple solution to not testing
above 10,000 is to grow with salts and
[SPEAKER_05]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not the kind of cannabis I
smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer not to smoke salts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, you know, hugely passionate about
organics, but a debate I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: is if you got the absolute highest quality
produce salt grown and the highest quality
[SPEAKER_02]: organic, do you think they're on par or do
you think there's still a better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I struggle with this personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my personal experience, I think the
absolute best salt grown, it can be close
[SPEAKER_02]: if not on par, you know, and that,
but it's, I never see it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it like once a year at the Emerald
Cup from one person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil growing is not easy and not everybody
does it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you that long ago, me and,
um, me and Jill did a side by side.
[SPEAKER_04]: She did hydro and soil and she crushed me
on the yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we both agreed that the soil grown pot
tasted better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was not, it was like,
she got like eight ounces and I got like
[SPEAKER_05]: three ounces cause they're playing
oversize mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this really fun, cool experiment,
a wonderful memory.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the end, I mean, her pot even
looked better and had more resin on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the end, when you smoked a bong hit
the shit in the dirt, smoke better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It turned white and disappeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why a lot of people grow soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now having said that scientifically,
there's no difference, but we both know
[SPEAKER_05]: there's something symbiotic going on down
there in the soil and the roots and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's some kind of harmony and some kind
of hippie shit going on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why so many people grow in
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, um, I don't get into a lot of
hippie shit, but I get into a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: hippie shit around soil and the benefits
of like just even interacting with it and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the last things I wanted to ask you
about was the Chernobyl line.
[SPEAKER_02]: This and especially the Slimer clone has
gained a lot of popularity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you consider ever working with it
more?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I actually have Slimer here and
not only do I have Slimer here,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we talked about earlier, I have the
genetic rights to sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was marketed under my own strength,
but the story of Slimer is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: A guy named Coma found the clone and
started yelling, Slimer, Slimer,
[SPEAKER_05]: Slimer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never even had the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started showing up in clubs and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And somebody gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the golden ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, these are just phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot buy into this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's one phenotype that runs
around called Slimer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guarantee if you caught a 10 pack,
you'd find another one, another 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd find another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it happens to make a lot of resin,
but all Chernobyl strains make a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a strain called blood wreck
and it just, it piles it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm happy to report that Badger has
the blood wreck cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Jack the Ripper and he's making
Chernobyl right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So something that we really enjoy making
is still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I would suggest is if you are a
grower to grow out a 10 pack and find your
[SPEAKER_05]: own Slimer versus something that somebody
else selected, because we all have our own
[SPEAKER_05]: taste and what someone likes, you may not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've always been the grow it and select
it guy to the point to where even around
[SPEAKER_05]: here, the shops that the people around
here will not crack a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll come to Sub's house and take some
cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Sub, will you take a cut for us?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we have one of your cuts?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like crack a pack of seeds and I can
crack up a 10 pack and find the best
[SPEAKER_05]: female in 50 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just laziness that people don't do
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having said that, I'll keep cracking seeds
and finding those winners and putting them
[SPEAKER_05]: out on the street, which is what Coma did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why you hear about these
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the watermelon fino of nine pound
hammer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the marmalade fino of jelly beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the rubber tire fino of agent
orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the God's pussy fino of vortex.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the purple quirkle.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, the internet tends to put
labels on things and then people latch
[SPEAKER_05]: onto them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly can echo that sentiment of,
you know, popping more seeds and finding
[SPEAKER_02]: your own one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I can attest, you know, I found my
own Slimer and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically brings us to the last part of
the interview where we do the quick fire
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, what's your favorite
strain right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: God, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got, it's gotta be the Jesus,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just, it dumps so many
crystals and it does it so well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a great inspiring hobby.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an unfair question.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite strain today is pineapple
express.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause John gave me three grams of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crystals.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, my favorite strain is cannabis,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me change that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
what do you think is the worst strain in
[SPEAKER_02]: your opinion that got traction with the
masses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm going to take a lot of heat
for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the hardest time finding a good
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown five packs of the damn stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, every time I say it, but you know,
DJ son, Ty tax me and I ain't like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I read DJ's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love DJ's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to grow a 10 pack and get me
a bomb ass blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you believe me?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, it hasn't happened in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that would be the one that,
you know, I see it everywhere and I see
[SPEAKER_05]: people with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for me, four packs, nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could only smoke one land race
for the rest of your life, what would it
[SPEAKER_02]: be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Apollo 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be a land race.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it a little harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not really my thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I definitely like Joel's.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mess this up every time I say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Hawkin, you know, O A X.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's how you say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's well Hawkin, but it's ox a can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a strain called Pina Rita that
he made with that old school Colombian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Hamard guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the flavors and the turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was never a Thai guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was never a Jamaican guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was never a Lamb's bread guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Designer weed may be my thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lucky last, if you could go back to any
point in history, you know, whether it be
[SPEAKER_02]: just within your life or within any point
in all of history and select any seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: what would you get?
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I any, I had, there's nothing I
haven't worked with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a cheeky answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing that I haven't asked for
or gotten to work with in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The G 13 Cali miss a 13 to C 99,
the killer queen AK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm, I would like to have the Pino
Norbach really fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anybody has a line on it,
I would really, really, really like to
[SPEAKER_05]: have it, but I pretty much have access to
anything I want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, maybe the original Northern lights,
you know, before it was adulterated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could actually maybe see what it was
like before it became five or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even that one, but I mean,
I smoked it and worked with it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I'm saying I'm really happy
with my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that probably just about brings
us to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for stopping by and for
dropping all the knowledge and for all the
[SPEAKER_02]: history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got a couple of shout outs to
make.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to give a shout out to all the
people in my current crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, Victoria, I don't know what
I would do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: These people will save my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Came to my house and my house burnt down
and physically put me in his car and
[SPEAKER_05]: brought me to his house and put me on his
couch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have nothing without that,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jen and Joel, my North Shire genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost every fucking thing I own,
every seed, every roach clip, everything I
[SPEAKER_05]: own.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went to Jen and Joel's after the
fire and I acquired the genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thanks so much for coming and
spending some time with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for letting me address directly
just, you know, so much stuff that swirls
[SPEAKER_05]: around my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last thing I say, I make many
mistakes in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: My biggest one is I open my mouth when I
shouldn't, but I'm a passionate person.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, folks.
