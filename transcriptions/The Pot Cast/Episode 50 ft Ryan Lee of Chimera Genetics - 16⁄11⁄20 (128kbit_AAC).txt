[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about all things cannabis,
science and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're ready for a big one,

[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a three part of the first
one ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome
to the genetic maestro himself,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan of Chimera Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for taking the time to
chat with us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my pleasure, heavenly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question we like to ask
guests these days is, what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: currently been smoking on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm not really smoking a lot of
flour these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last couple of years, I've really been
focused on vaping concentrates,
[SPEAKER_04]: not even really dabbing them on a hot
nail, either just with a torch or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just a lower temp kind of vape
device.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it's a lot easier on my lungs and,
you know, as we start getting up on an
[SPEAKER_04]: age, you know, I kind of, when I hang out
with friends at conferences and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: we used to do that back in the day with
Emerald Cup or whatever we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of really, really heavy
smoking that goes on and I just find that
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't really go well too well with my
lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather do a smaller inhalation of
something much, much stronger and more
[SPEAKER_04]: flavorful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've kind of been staying away from the
flour to be perfectly frank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just really smoking on fresh live rosin
and really nice fresh dabs that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: are popping around in the community these
days here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can certainly relate to that
sentiment having recently put down the
[SPEAKER_01]: bong and picked up the vape myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my question is, do you feel like
there are any specific cultivars which
[SPEAKER_01]: really lend themselves to being smoked
through a vape in concentrate form?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they all do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a really good live rosin or a
live resin kind of extract is really just
[SPEAKER_04]: the essence of the plant and the THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're removing all that, you know,
that leaf material that really is not
[SPEAKER_04]: adding anything of health to your lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's certainly not adding anything to
the experience of the smoke or of the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really think that that kind of
direction, whether it's a high quality CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever the extraction method is,
as long as you remove all the solvents and
[SPEAKER_04]: even better if you're using solvent less
techniques, you're really just getting the
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the plant that, you know,
is really is what we want, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just an evolution from,
you know, started off as hashed each and
[SPEAKER_04]: then we all kind of got into the bubble
hash and the dry cysts, but these extracts
[SPEAKER_04]: they use, as you know, probably they use
heat and pressure to pull the essential
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds out of that kind of more natural
matrix of the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're, you know, if it's processed
and cared for carefully, you end up with a
[SPEAKER_04]: product that in my opinion is a lot
healthier to smoke than, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: sucking on half gram joints all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the amount of tar consumed is
astronomically different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that reason alone, I'm on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: In past episodes, we've had breeders talk
about this idea of breeding for the end
[SPEAKER_01]: goal of making concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they would reference,
you know, big gland heads, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you ever consider something like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just think like a good strain
will translate to good concentrates and
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need to specifically set out to
do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good cultivar should definitely,
I mean, if it's grown well, that's what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're trying to do is bring out that peak
essential oil expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that any kind of variety is
really good for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely something going on with
the size of the resin gland and either the
[SPEAKER_04]: ratio of the thickness of the gland to the
internal diameter, you know, the internal
[SPEAKER_04]: diameter, essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So think of it like a, we call it a waxy
pillow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the pillow case is made of
something that is somewhat fibrous or waxy
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got, you know, there's actually no
drug content in the structure of the
[SPEAKER_04]: trichome itself, but the inside of that
pillow is where all the the essential oils
[SPEAKER_04]: are produced in the plant and certainly
where the cannabinoids are produced as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so really being able to like
take those compounds out or the oil that
[SPEAKER_04]: is in those compounds, which is really
what I call what I consider the essence of
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not so sure that we've really do
understand whether it's there's a specific
[SPEAKER_04]: gland size or maybe when the gland gets to
a certain size that the membrane that
[SPEAKER_04]: surrounds that waxy pillow gets thicker so
it can hold in the contents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, that's made for material
that is not really what we're after as
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of in the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think really a good extract is
about removing the things that we want
[SPEAKER_04]: from the things that we don't want without
changing the chemical profile of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way, any extract really will let
or any good quality extract will let the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant shine in its in its best form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we like them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's expensive to do with a with a
tire, you know, a haze or something like
[SPEAKER_04]: the lemon pine that I was using for a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make incredible extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the ratio, the return is
not very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a breeding goal, really,
it's just about producing biomass with
[SPEAKER_04]: enough what we call oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Content, you know, so that you they can
shine in extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, a great point you just touched
on there about, you know, haze and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these smaller yielding sativa varieties,
you know, making it a hard sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: argument for the return on investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember in an episode with DJ Short,
he discussed how some of these varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: have like a higher proportion of the
systolic trichomes that don't have that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pillowcase that we've been
referencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you think that there is still a lot
of room to make concentrates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think DJ said that, you know,
they tend to secrete the oils onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that you could still get a
good return from that, given that the oils
[SPEAKER_01]: there somewhere, it's just maybe not in
the trichrome head?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think the trichrome head is
really fundamentally necessary to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: good concentrate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I don't like creating drama
with people, but he's actually not correct
[SPEAKER_04]: to say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's systolic hairs are non glandular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they actually don't really produce an
oil that's extractable or that is secreted
[SPEAKER_04]: by the structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really like a thought long thin kind
of pointy thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at a resin gland under,
you know, some kind of microscopic
[SPEAKER_04]: picture, there's all sorts of them on the
net.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, bubble man has got a lot of
great ones if you follow him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can kind of see that the actual
structure, it's really about what's inside
[SPEAKER_04]: that glandular head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's shorter, you know,
gland.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also there's a few different types
of glands on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's these non, you know, non cap it at
glands and there's the bulbous glands that
[SPEAKER_04]: sit on on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you were saying, they're kind of more
down towards they don't really have a kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of think of it like a golf ball on a tee
that sticks into the into the leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't really have the tea part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like kind of a little gland on
the on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not sure that those are really too
important in the overall processing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in the overall space.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some definite differences in
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think with our current extraction
methods, unless you're actually physically
[SPEAKER_04]: separating those gland heads by size,
we're really just going in with either
[SPEAKER_04]: heat or pressure or a solvent to pull
those things out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to for the most part,
you're going to get it all anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a question I'm very interested in,
but one that's kind of hard to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: people without a scientific background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been waiting for you to come on so
you could give me your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember in that same chat with DJ,
we were talking about like the biochemical
[SPEAKER_01]: nature of like what makes you feel a
strain as a sativa versus an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's obviously still a bit of a cloudy
area where we don't really have it down
[SPEAKER_01]: pat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something which always comes to my
mind is that even if you take a really
[SPEAKER_01]: racy sativa and make a concentrate,
it doesn't tend to have that same racy
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you might still perceive it as a bit
sativary, but it's certainly mellowed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think that it may be indicates
that there's something in the plant matter
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't being extracted, which
contributes to the perceptual feel of a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so a few things that we should
probably touch on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's come back to the indica sativa thing
and just talk about the chemical chemistry
[SPEAKER_04]: thing for a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually we can use Dan as a great
example.
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ, he had all these great varieties,
but his whole thing has always been... He
[SPEAKER_04]: came from a time period where we weren't
breeding using a lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were always selecting plants based on
how they make you feel, not how much THC
[SPEAKER_04]: there is in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I was doing some work down in
the States and I collected a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of Dan's stuff, both in clone and from
seed, and we grew a fair amount of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one thing that I noticed in
general was that the plants were actually
[SPEAKER_04]: relatively low THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were in most of them, not all of
them, but the vast majority of them fell
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of in the 8 to 12 to 13% range,
which is pretty low for the market average
[SPEAKER_04]: these days, at least in North America and
California specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've also noticed this with other...
If you listen to experiences of people
[SPEAKER_04]: that take the sesamate, which is a
synthetic THC, it's actually not THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a synthetic THC in a peanut oil
matrix, kind of a jelly type pill capsule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you take those things or you ask
the patients that are using them what they
[SPEAKER_04]: feel, and they always say that they get
really tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've kind of noticed after having
access to the lab, and playing with a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of these different varieties, and smoking
them, and also having the ability to run
[SPEAKER_04]: them through to understand their
cannabinoid profile, is that when you
[SPEAKER_04]: start turning the THC way up, you really
do get that lethargic property.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that what a lot of people
sometimes confuse for the effects of
[SPEAKER_04]: mircine is actually a result of a high THC
concentration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas Dan was always selecting for
plants based on their, again, how they
[SPEAKER_04]: made him feel, not on the basis of a lab
report.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that there's something to
that ceilingless high, that really clarity
[SPEAKER_04]: that you get from smoking what you're
referring to as the sativas, I call them
[SPEAKER_04]: equatorials, those more equatorial plants,
that they were not really bred for high
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really in that lighter,
what I would call the lighter class of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm mid-40s, so I'm gonna say younger
generation, but obviously we're now not
[SPEAKER_04]: the younger generation anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think in regards to the folks that
were smoking a lot during the 60s and 70s
[SPEAKER_04]: and early 80s, and working back then,
those types of headspace, you hear it all
[SPEAKER_04]: the time, where these older hippie elders
from our community say, today's cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: is too strong and we don't have those
units of unique headspaces that you used
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to get from the Acapulco Golds
and the Hawaiians and the Thais.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a theory, and I haven't
confirmed this 100% obviously,
[SPEAKER_04]: but my theory is that a lot of those
headspaces that you could get back then
[SPEAKER_04]: were because the cannabis actually wasn't
stronger than even 15% cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Canada, I'm in Canada and now we have
this legal, this national legalization
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the provincial distributors that buy
the cannabis from the growers,
[SPEAKER_04]: they really don't want to even look at
anything less than 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is crazy, because if you transfer
that analogy over to the alcohol industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would wipe out most of the wines and
all of the beers and the ciders and all
[SPEAKER_04]: that kind of stuff and really push into
the spirit world, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The whiskeys and the gins and the vodkas,
all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that having a regulatory
system that encourages us to just start
[SPEAKER_04]: chasing high THC numbers is actually not a
great way to be producing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, we're not considering the
way that these plants make people feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: The younger generation, that's all they've
grown up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these kids start with dabs and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get a lot more THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a larger dose of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, again, like I said, that's my
personal belief that that's actually one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the things that's leading to this,
what I call THC lethargy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the community, we try to say,
oh, terpenaline or limonene or pinene,
[SPEAKER_04]: they make you up, they give you an up
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then myrcine brings you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the truth is, is that we actually
haven't done those type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's studies yet to be able to say that
conclusively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And legally, in most countries,
you can't do that kind of study.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in Canada, the licensed
producers here, they need a special
[SPEAKER_04]: license to consume the cannabis they're
producing on site, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If a grower wants to smoke his own weed
and they don't have that license,
[SPEAKER_04]: they have to sell it to the liquor
distribution board and it goes out to the
[SPEAKER_04]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they have to go and buy their
cannabis retail before they can even try
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of bizarre, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like imagine you're a vinter or a master
brewer and you couldn't taste your wine or
[SPEAKER_04]: your beer during the production process.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of insane, but that's what we've
ended up with in the regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So being in this legal system has really
forced people to start saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, we can't smoke the plants,
so what we're going to do is send them all
[SPEAKER_04]: to a laboratory and then pick the one with
the highest THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, imagine you did that for whiskey or
wine, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't go into the wine store and say,
okay, I need a nice straw with the highest
[SPEAKER_04]: alcohol content.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not the way that we consume
those products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's kind of weird that that has
been the way that we're now marketing and
[SPEAKER_04]: advertising cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a phenomenal explanation right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You raise such a brilliant analogy in
regards to, you know, like the high
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol content and something which has
been brought up in prior episodes is this
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of should cannabis be treated just
like tomatoes, should it be treated like
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it is a bit of a sort of complex
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think should be the general
regulatory framework around cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: does it need its own new one?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have to take pieces of all the
different regulatory systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm of the opinion that cannabis is a
drug, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a psychoactive substance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that doesn't mean that it's dangerous,
but it does mean that we don't want to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I was in high school and I was
smoking cannabis, but I think if I was
[SPEAKER_04]: designing a regulatory system as an adult,
that I would probably say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: like kids under, well, I don't know,
set the age because it would probably be
[SPEAKER_04]: younger than most.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that there's probably enough
scientific data to say, hey, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: we actually, we shouldn't provide high THC
cannabis to kids under 18.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, not that I necessarily
agree with that as a personal ethic,
[SPEAKER_04]: but because I don't believe that it's as
dangerous as it's made to seem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But part of using psychoactive substances
in any culture is a taught experience,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cultural information that's passed
down from the elders to the younger
[SPEAKER_04]: generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, people need to
be of a certain age to really appreciate
[SPEAKER_04]: how to truly start using these substances
properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I was like 13 and 14 and
sitting around the table at Christmas
[SPEAKER_04]: dinner, you know, the kids in my family,
my brother and I, we were allowed to have
[SPEAKER_04]: a very small glass of wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all the parents were having it
and it's just kind of one of those things
[SPEAKER_04]: as kids is like, why don't we get to have
a little taste too?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think there's anything
dangerous of letting children have,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's not say children, but young teens
have a small taste of wine in the context
[SPEAKER_04]: of a family celebration at the dinner
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I want that child then going and taking
a bottle of wine and hanging out with his
[SPEAKER_04]: friends?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though, you know, obviously most
teens do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They try to get beer or alcohol for the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think again, as an adult, if I were
designing a system for that, I probably
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't create a situation where it was
easy for them to get access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I wholeheartedly agree with you and
nothing new here being said, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: studies pretty conclusively show that a
lot of European countries that follow the
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of style of introducing small amounts
of alcohol in family settings,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's shown to be beneficial because
you're kind of normalizing it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can't, I mean, if you want young
adults to make responsible choices,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to respect them and treat them as
intelligent enough to make their own
[SPEAKER_04]: choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of that is giving them the tools
so that when they do encounter these
[SPEAKER_04]: substances on their own later in life,
that they know how to interact with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, reasonably, and that's kind
of what I think my, my mom's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: her idea was, was behind letting us have
small things about it is again,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's cultural knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of teaching people how to
interact with these substances,
[SPEAKER_04]: substances in a responsible way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is don't, you know,
this just say, no, all drugs are bad
[SPEAKER_04]: approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it obviously doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it sets up children for to
believe, you know, because again,
[SPEAKER_04]: you hear drugs are bad, drug is bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't touch cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bad too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when people try cannabis,
they realize that it's not what the elders
[SPEAKER_04]: told them it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now you've created a situation
where the younger generation doesn't trust
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that are trying to teach them
life lessons on how to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: how to go about interacting with these
substances through life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my personal opinion is to just be
responsible and educated and arm the kids
[SPEAKER_04]: with as much information so that they can
then go on and make responsible choices.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am one of the biggest advocates you'll
find of like harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's totally in line with
that sort of philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question, which kind of stems off that a
little bit, which I have been pondering
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, especially since picking up the
vape as my preferred ingestion method is
[SPEAKER_01]: that I do wonder if, as you referenced,
you know, a lot of the younger generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they might've started out on dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the question needs to be
asked if that sort of excessive saturation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the THC receptors could have some
deleterious effect, just in terms of maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even just your own ability to enjoy the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that at periods of time when I've
been smoking particularly heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can kind of notice like you're not
getting as high.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that like some amount of
self-restraint actually could lead to a
[SPEAKER_01]: more long-term enjoyment of the plant and
the concentrates in general?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, you know, we know this with opioid
receptors and it's showing true as well
[SPEAKER_04]: with cannabinoid receptors is that when
you drive one of these neurochemical
[SPEAKER_04]: systems with an excess of the ligand or
the molecule that is binding to these
[SPEAKER_04]: receptors, that the receptors do something
called, they undergo a process called down
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation where they actually become
fewer receptors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of like a way to balance
for the, you know, you're, they,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cells want to maintain that level of
signal that is being passed from the
[SPEAKER_04]: postsynaptic presynaptic nerves.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the postsynaptic nerve where the
receptor is located, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially we have a natural or
endogenous signal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can assign it any kind of
value you want, call it a hundred that
[SPEAKER_04]: goes from the presynaptic nerve to the
postsynaptic nerve terminal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we, when that, you know,
your body has a natural level of
[SPEAKER_04]: endogenous opioids that exists and work in
that system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we smoke cannabis,
what we're doing is we're driving that
[SPEAKER_04]: system harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, we're putting in a model of a
molecule that mimics the endogenous ligand
[SPEAKER_04]: and that essentially overdrives the
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're, we're now we're giving the
receptors a much greater signal than
[SPEAKER_04]: they're used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for them to compensate,
what they do is they, they down regulate
[SPEAKER_04]: the number of receptors and it kind of
brings the, the nut, the amount of signal
[SPEAKER_04]: going from the previous nerve to the post
nerve down into the similar type of line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we, when we then pull away that
exogenous signal, we, we stop smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, your body is now compensated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're actually now getting too little
signal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a case of, um, you know,
that's what we call withdrawal really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, I think that it's probably,
it's probably, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of using cannabis and being a
cannabis user, tolerance breaks are really
[SPEAKER_04]: good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, people obviously need these compounds
for using for medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think any of these,
you know, I'm going to call them quote
[SPEAKER_04]: sacred plants, um, or, or medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a great idea to be
using them all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's something to be said for
taking breaks and having moments of
[SPEAKER_04]: clarity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if you do that,
you take a couple of weeks off of
[SPEAKER_04]: consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will find just like you said,
that when you go back to it, the same
[SPEAKER_04]: amount that you were using two weeks ago
has a much greater effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's one thing on that topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that's kind of interesting
on the topic that I don't think any,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, any markets have really truly embraced
yet is the type two cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis that has a balance of CBD and
THC of, you know, most people know the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the variety can a tonic from,
from resin seeds in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that's, that's a type two plant
and the thing that makes type two plants
[SPEAKER_04]: no different from the high THC plants is
that they produce about 50% of their,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, total cannabinoid fraction as CBD
rather than THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's just the beginnings of,
uh, scientific research that are being
[SPEAKER_04]: done in kind of the neuroscience community
and the health community that show that
[SPEAKER_04]: having that little bit of a CBD buffer in
your experience actually might provide
[SPEAKER_04]: some, um, some safety against the things
that you were talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: over, over driving your system with
massive amounts of dabs all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so there might even be a safety aspect
to having CBD and in the context again of
[SPEAKER_04]: what we were talking about before with
children or kids under 20, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe the solution is to have them only
have access to type two cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't get access to have access of
the really truly potent stuff until they
[SPEAKER_04]: turn 18 or 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know how you would go about
enforcing that, but it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that whole area of the CBD
buffer is something that, um, really
[SPEAKER_04]: hasn't been explored very much by the
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it has a potential for use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a topic in general,
which we're kind of skirting around slash
[SPEAKER_01]: touching on a little bit is something
which a lot of people really don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledge is that there can be like sort
of downsides or excessive use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people are really
just so invested in this idea of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is a hundred percent safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's non harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always have a bit of a problem with
that because it's like, there's many cases
[SPEAKER_01]: of like people smoking cannabis and then
unfortunately running in front of a car,
[SPEAKER_01]: like not on purpose, but like,
I just find it hard to stomach when people
[SPEAKER_01]: just raise it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no possible downside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to a kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started smoking 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you've said, like it is worth
considering if that's actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: realistically true statement because
you're a kind of experience as a child
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't represent everyone's and it's,
it is worth considering what's best for a
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 year old, a 15 year old, an 18 year
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I really like that sentiment
you'd express right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it just like there's different types
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people need to be aware that,
you know, human are our individual
[SPEAKER_04]: neurochemical makeup is different from
person to person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not only necessarily about the
chemistry of the plant, there's
[SPEAKER_04]: variability in the chemistry, in the
neurochemistry of the population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we really don't know, you know,
I have a lot of friends and they're just
[SPEAKER_04]: like, cannabis isn't for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I had friends that were in,
you know, I was in high school with,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I used to smoke with them and then
they got a little bit older and they,
[SPEAKER_04]: they tell me, you know, I just,
I just realized it wasn't good for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't making me feel healthy,
mentally stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew another lovely little, not a lovely
little girl, but a lovely girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was in her early thirties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I met her, she was smoking fair
bit of cannabis and she got right into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watched her go through a mental
spiral.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've never seen on anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, to the point that she
thought that there was people in the,
[SPEAKER_04]: in, in the light switches in the,
you know, the electrical outlets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, she was putting like
tin foil on top of light fixtures and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really bizarre behavior,
but she definitely wasn't using any other
[SPEAKER_04]: drug and the cannabis wasn't helping her.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to have this, and I actually
substituted her cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took all our cannabis away from her,
gave her a bunch of CBD cannabis that had
[SPEAKER_04]: no THC in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seemed to help a little bit,
but at that point in time, I think,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, she had, she had overdriven her
endocannabinoid system so hard that just
[SPEAKER_04]: with her particular neurochemistry,
it didn't work for her.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anybody that says, you know,
all cannabis is medicine and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's no matter how you use it,
it's medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: That to me is just not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've seen it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it happen and it's well
documented in the scientific literature
[SPEAKER_04]: and the medical literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a small subset of people and we
don't know whether it's their genetics or
[SPEAKER_04]: their neuro chemistry, but whatever it is,
cannabis doesn't interact well with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're looking at creating a
regulated market or a system as a
[SPEAKER_04]: government official, you have to be
thinking about the lowest common
[SPEAKER_04]: denominator, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to make your safety barriers safe
for everybody, not just the top 90%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just if 10% people suffer from using the
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, being aware of the different
types of cannabis, I think is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also this idea that all cannabis use
is harmless is probably not, I don't think
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a really responsible way to think
about it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to jump back to the concentrates
topic we were discussing a moment ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: something which has always been an
interest to me is that someone,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember who it was unfortunately,
but they pointed out to me that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the technology and especially the
techniques used in extraction processing
[SPEAKER_01]: these days are actually very old school
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's patents going back to the
1920s and 30s, which outline a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: methods currently being used and sort of
presented as like the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured you'd be better to ask than
anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen any genuine new advances in
extraction or do you feel like it's true
[SPEAKER_01]: to what I said where it is all kind of
rehashed old technology?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, although, you know, we've had a
lot of really great chemists in the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: phytochemists in the world for 150 years
at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of one of those stories
where there's nothing new under the sun,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe people are modifying old techniques,
but yeah, this is all like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: even distillation for THC or fractional
distillation or for example, the butane
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts, those type of alkane
carbohydrate or those alkane extractions,
[SPEAKER_04]: they all really have their roots in other
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other industries and maybe people are
changing things a little bit, temperature,
[SPEAKER_04]: all that kind of stuff to optimize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think for the most part,
it's not, most of it's not that new.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just new to cannabis because cannabis
is, because of prohibition, it's been left
[SPEAKER_04]: out of so many different systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people just couldn't touch the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 30 years ago you had to be
pretty rebellious to actually be braving
[SPEAKER_04]: the penalties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just, it kept a lot of people that
can teach the cannabis community different
[SPEAKER_04]: techniques or sets of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kept them away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least in Canada, now we're starting
to integrate all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're able to collaborate with
people in existing industries and tap into
[SPEAKER_04]: all that, that knowledge base that they
have, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, cannabis is just another
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different plant, but you know,
we can use all the same kind of science
[SPEAKER_04]: that we use on all the other plants in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, in line with that idea,
I think I was reading an article written
[SPEAKER_01]: by a CBD extractor who was trying to
figure out why they were getting such high
[SPEAKER_01]: returns on their CBD extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they hypothesize was that some of
the terpenes you find in CBD cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: the type two cultivars may actually be
acting as kind of like almost an
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial solvent in the process and
helping to extract more things through
[SPEAKER_01]: that solvent being present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard anything about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that were to be true, do you think
that might indicate that breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain terpene predominance could be like
a good idea if your main goal is
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they would aid in
extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can definitely optimize cultivars
through breeding for extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the things that we did
when I was down in California is we were
[SPEAKER_04]: not only looking at the terpene profiles
of plants, but actually measuring their
[SPEAKER_04]: overall terpene output.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were kind of one of the first groups to
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we were finding plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a, we called the, you know,
our friends at SC Labs called it the
[SPEAKER_04]: schwag flag, but we typically would
eliminate any plant that was under one
[SPEAKER_04]: percent total terpene content.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it didn't have, you know, 10 milligrams
of terpenes per gram that was out,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just didn't make the list unless it had
some other characteristic that was so
[SPEAKER_04]: unique about the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for example, we came across a
THCV plant that we kept because that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: really rare cannabinoid, but the terpene
profile on the plant sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smelled like hemp and it wasn't,
it wasn't oily.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just not really tasty to consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that became one of our lower
limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, through time, we would raise that
number, you know, one and a half,
[SPEAKER_04]: two percent of terpene content and
anything below that we wouldn't keep
[SPEAKER_04]: because the idea was to be making these
plants produce as much, not only the right
[SPEAKER_04]: complement of terpene, the right set of
terpenes, but also we wanted to have them
[SPEAKER_04]: produce more terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's definitely a whole lot of
world there where we can be taking,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, because it might be,
for example, we're talking about making
[SPEAKER_04]: dabs and you want to have a full,
I'm going to call, I hate the word,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm going to use it anyway,
these full terpene extract plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you might want to have,
end up with a dab or with a, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: your concentrate that is really high in
terpenes, but say it only has 40% total
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: As opposed to a lot of terpenes and 80%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure most of the community is probably
listening to me say those things right now
[SPEAKER_04]: and thinking, well, that's not what I
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, getting back to this discussion
where we were talking about how things
[SPEAKER_04]: make you feel, there definitely is going
to be a whole subset of the population
[SPEAKER_04]: that for them, you know, they don't want
to drink whiskey, they want to drink wine,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to vape on a pen all night,
not have one puff and be comatose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something that I hear from a
lot of, you know, the older hippies that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in touch with in the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of funny when you say
it that way, but it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, oh, you kids today,
your music is too loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, you kids today,
your weed is just too strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's true for them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I bring over an OG Kush to a
party at like, you know, an older family
[SPEAKER_04]: member's house and pass it around the
campfire and they're out, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're staring at the wall for the next
three hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't just, they don't want that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rick, why would you want that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not fun, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for, you know, for every
occasional kind of thing, but that's just
[SPEAKER_04]: to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what cannabis was, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis was something that they could sit
around the campfire and smoke all night
[SPEAKER_04]: and enjoy the flavor of their,
of their dupe, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's something to be said about,
about breeding plants that have lots of
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor and they don't punch you in the
face when you smoke them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not be for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not be for everybody, but I think
that we have to start thinking about
[SPEAKER_04]: making cannabis more accessible to other
people and how can we do that,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the things we need to do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it using these type two varieties with
a little bit of CBD in them?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe even, even in Switzerland,
you know, I don't know if you've heard
[SPEAKER_04]: about the CBD markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're now selling CBD cigarettes and
grocery stores in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're type three plants which have,
you know, lots of CBD and almost no THC in
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, they're, they're effectively
hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you can make hemp taste like an OG
Kush or you can make it taste like a
[SPEAKER_04]: really flavorful haze or something really
nice that's, it's nice for people to
[SPEAKER_04]: consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it might not be what most of the
people listening to this podcast want,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if we can create a whole nother
segment of the population that are
[SPEAKER_04]: embracing cannabis and benefiting from
cannabis, I think that that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't need to be high,
you know, it's, it's, I think it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: great that we can have more people having
a relationship with this fantastic plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it is one of those things
where when you are an everyday smoker,
[SPEAKER_01]: just puffing away on your OG Kush,
it does seem like a very foreign idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am a little bit guilty of falling
into that trap you mentioned of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, old people wanting the,
the less strong weed and just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: being a bit perplexed at the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nowadays I find myself in that same
position and I've got this new found
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation for the orange strains,
which maybe classically aren't considered
[SPEAKER_01]: as strong, but boy is the flavor nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the truth is we can bring,
breed those things to, to be high THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can breed them to be a mixed ratio of
CBT to THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can also breed those same flavors
to be in the CBD plants, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a matter of, of making the
right crosses and selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I, one of the things I love about
cannabis is the diversity that it brings
[SPEAKER_04]: as a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, who am I to say now only
these ones are the ones that we're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I kind of see my job as a breeder is to
make all the different types available.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the doctors and the stoners and
the, and you know, everybody's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out what works for them,
the patients, but at least they have the
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to do that when we can provide
this broad selection of chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not everybody needs the THC
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like the THC stuff, I like the
THC stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of where it's kind of
my go-to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying don't use high THC
cannabis, but I'm just saying if,
[SPEAKER_04]: if we can have more people have a
relationship with cannabis because we make
[SPEAKER_04]: them tasty, tasty cultivars of high CBD,
low THC, you know, flower that's to me,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to jump back to kind of some
terpene talk for just a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether
you feel that it's becoming a more common
[SPEAKER_01]: trend that people are adding terpenes
either to concentrates, maybe even trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to infuse flower that is maybe a bit less
than ideal in its terpene content with
[SPEAKER_01]: external terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like this is deleterious,
advantageous and do you feel like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: any benefit because there's a lot of
discussion around, oh, it's non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: derived terpenes and that's inferior to
cannabis derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, the inner chemist in me thinks
myosin is myosin, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will bring it back to water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can make, you know,
you can make water in a lab by combining
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrogen and oxygen, or you can take sewer
water and distill out pure water,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one would you rather drink?
[SPEAKER_04]: The truth is, if you purify them both,
they're both just water, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing, no matter what the
source is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, water is water is water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what's, what's it contaminated with?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: A, is it contaminated?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're getting myosin from a different
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we co-extracting anything else with
the myosin?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so what are the contaminants in
that, that bottle of myosin that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: buying to dump on your flowers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, or to your concentrates?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the contaminant?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the levels of those contaminants?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's the health consequences of
those, of those contaminants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because plants make compounds that are
poisonous to humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They try to defend themselves from us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from, you know, any, any plant that's
a herbivorous, someone that's a test,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, plant that are an animal that's
attacking a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these defense compounds can actually be
bad for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we're going into some,
you know, call it some weird lemongrass or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that to try and find some
terpenes to put into our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The potential is there that if there were
a secondary metabolite produced by the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant that was poisonous to humans,
that we co-extract it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that's in with the myosin,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that myosin enters the,
or that met, that contaminated myosin
[SPEAKER_04]: enters the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that could be a problem is
when we, when we consume cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's natural physiological levels of
these chemicals that the plant can
[SPEAKER_04]: produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last 30, 40 years of science seems
to show that there's no deleterious effect
[SPEAKER_04]: on human health by using those.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it could be, if we start making,
you know, it might, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: these, these limonene, limonene,
terpenelene, pineene, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes, as you were saying earlier,
they're solvents, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They, they, they can dissolve
cannabinoids, but they can actually also
[SPEAKER_04]: dissolve like certain types of plastic or
rubber.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Sam Skunkman was telling me a
story about they had this haze plant that
[SPEAKER_04]: they used to harvest in California,
I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they had these rubber rings that
sat on the top of the jars and they would
[SPEAKER_04]: close off and the rubber would seal in the
jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you, you left the, them in there
for three or four months, the terps would
[SPEAKER_04]: actually dissolve away the, the rubber.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there's a potential issue with all
these plastics that we're using to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, to hold cannabis, especially the
cheaper stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, in a non-regulated market,
nobody's paying attention to these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they could have potential health
consequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if you, if you're making high
terp dabs and you're putting them in these
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic containers, you can actually see
sometimes when you, when you clean out the
[SPEAKER_04]: container that the plastic has started to
melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And did that, did that plastic then melt
into the dabs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you now consuming these things?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there's a lot of health issues that I
think we have to really keep at the
[SPEAKER_04]: forefront of our planning as we go about
creating regulated markets all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't mean that we shouldn't do
it, but it just means that we should have
[SPEAKER_04]: some kind of thought and really careful
due diligence before just doing whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: As if, you know, as if the way that we
have done things in the black market have,
[SPEAKER_04]: have been the right way to do things,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done them out of necessity,
typically for the past 50 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it, we might learn and we are learning
with some of the chemicals that we spray
[SPEAKER_04]: on the plant that these things stick
around, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The story used to be, if you're veg,
if you're in veg, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can spray on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to end up in the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: But shit, we started doing the testing and
it's like, you know what, it all ends up
[SPEAKER_04]: in the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the practices that we've had
in black markets, they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: the practices that we use in regulated
markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about advancing our understanding
and creating a safe industry where people
[SPEAKER_04]: can use cannabis in, as you know,
like you said, from a harm reduction point
[SPEAKER_04]: of view, it's as safe as it's safe as it
can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Words of wisdom right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, you touch on a
brilliant point that we've come a long way
[SPEAKER_01]: since the days of Mycobutrenel and butane
soup, but I guess a topic which stems from
[SPEAKER_01]: that and what you just discussed is
there's a lot of current discussion and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even a bit of necessary discussion
around vape pens, particularly the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that come from say China or other areas of
the world where the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: standards are maybe a little less than
what they are in other Western countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that because of this issue
and the necessity for there to be high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality assurance of quality that
basically we will see the falling off of
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think that, you know,
China and maybe even African produced
[SPEAKER_01]: products will eventually creep into the
market over time and become the new
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant force at play?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think China is the dominant force
at play in all the vape technology that we
[SPEAKER_04]: have, at least in North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of that stuff's not produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I actually don't know any of
it that's actually produced in North
[SPEAKER_04]: America.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all comes from China.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I've got friends and
relationships with people in some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: large Canadian multibillion dollar
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know, you know, through speaking
with them about the issues that they've
[SPEAKER_04]: had in doing the due diligence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're going to if you're a
big, massive company and you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: put vape pens onto the market,
you know, we've got call it 35 million
[SPEAKER_04]: people here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little more but call out a market
of, you know, call it five to 10 million
[SPEAKER_04]: users.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of that's a lot of hardware
that you need to ensure that you're not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to run out that you have a supply
and being able to do the due diligence on
[SPEAKER_04]: the safety of those products coming from
China.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, if you're ordering five
hundred thousand vape pens or a million
[SPEAKER_04]: vape pens, you buy them from one company
and then they're like they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can't actually produce those all
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go and they outsource them to
another company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be doing all this batch
testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, again, if you're putting a
product onto the market, it's your ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make sure that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it comes back and it's not safe,
it's your shareholders that are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: suffer, not China.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have to do these really deep dives
into the, you know, upstream to the
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go over there, they check their
metals, they check the solders that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're putting they're using to fuse the
parts together to wire the, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the pens and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, all these things, cannabis has been
left out of all these systems for so long
[SPEAKER_04]: because the black market and people could
just do whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I remember being,
you know, in my younger years and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like if you couldn't score and finally you
got something, you were stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you got something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were able to you're able to to find
your weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't a beer drinker or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I was in high school and
university, I didn't really consume
[SPEAKER_04]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis was my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if I ever didn't have cannabis and
you had to go and buy, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're on the street looking for something
and it was just supplying bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was what was available.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you could find something,
then you were satisfied.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's probably not a very good way to
go about doing things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're if you're looking for
steak, you're not just going to pick up
[SPEAKER_04]: any old meat that's lying on the on the
supermarket floor or on the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be buying high quality
products where you know where they come
[SPEAKER_04]: from and you know that they've been made
with respect and treated with respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants have not been sprayed with
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to consume all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And inevitably, in a black market,
you do see a ton of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in California, we did some studies
and vast, vast amounts of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: that's on the market is like you said,
it's got Michael butanil in it or it's got
[SPEAKER_04]: mold on it or it's got a bacteria growing
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in the legal food production
systems, when there's you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we had one couple of weeks ago,
the onions were coming up from the states,
[SPEAKER_04]: red onions, and they had salmonella on
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a legal market, we have recall systems
to recall all that product and make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that it doesn't get into the hands of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it does get in the hands of
people, it's on the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody knows, hey, don't eat your
onions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take them off the menu because people are
going to get sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And black market cannabis systems don't
have those safeguards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of growers are, you know,
they get week five, week four,
[SPEAKER_04]: even all of a sudden, they get a big
spider mite infestation that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: kill the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they got two choices to kill the crop
and start again, or you spray it with
[SPEAKER_04]: someone got the chemical and cross your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way you can pay your mortgage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, you know, paying the
mortgage is it's one of the major excuses
[SPEAKER_04]: for for many, many evils in the world
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are just doing it because they're
trying to get by.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can understand why it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of honor in putting
those products in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, when people are desperate for
money or just paying the bill or they're
[SPEAKER_04]: just trying to get by or feed their
families, they often make choices that
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't in the best interests of the people
that are going to be consuming their
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, and again, in black market
systems, they don't know the people that
[SPEAKER_04]: are consuming their weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell it to a guy and it gets shipped
or it gets, you know, sold to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: people they don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there are a certain amount of
people that will they'll just spray it and
[SPEAKER_04]: not care about the consequences
downstream.
[SPEAKER_04]: So regulated systems, there are a lot of
good things about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pain in the ass to work in them,
but it's kind of the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of the frustration
that comes from the growers and in
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging in these systems is an idea you
touched on earlier in that because
[SPEAKER_01]: historically they've never had to really
pay attention to quality control,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It now seems like this big boogeyman when
in reality it's a part of every
[SPEAKER_01]: established industry in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if we do want to end up
being like a wine industry or some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: terroir based industry, then there has to
be a certain acceptance that these are
[SPEAKER_01]: just the necessary scaffolds that need to
be put in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it's about pride in your
product, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's people that just make
products because they just want to sell
[SPEAKER_04]: them and make some money.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those aren't the products that I want
to consume, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like products that are made by artisans
or that are, you know, are grown by a
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer with pride for what he's making.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with wine, you know, but same with
vegetables too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and meats, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people, they understand the art and
the science of their, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: their chosen field, they take pride in the
work that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how you could be proud of
putting cannabis on the market that you
[SPEAKER_04]: knew had a pesticide or a fungicide
sprayed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So onto a little bit of a somewhat
controversial topic, but it's one I do
[SPEAKER_01]: feel really personally invested in tobacco
and cannabis, given we've discussed how we
[SPEAKER_01]: should be doing everything we think we can
to kind of minimise the potential harmful
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that are within cannabis,
pesticides, heavy metals from vape cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like there should be somewhat
of an active effort to discourage the use
[SPEAKER_01]: of tobacco in conjunction with cannabis,
like what we see around general tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it's just an each to their
own sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that we should actively tell
people not to put tobacco in their
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, tobacco is a bronchial
constrictor, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you smoke tobacco, your lungs close on
you automatically.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you smoke cannabis, your lungs open
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bronchial dilator.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you mix the two, the health
minister in Canada, I think it was like
[SPEAKER_04]: about 20 years ago, it might even have
been 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember her coming out and saying,
we're really not too, too concerned about
[SPEAKER_04]: people consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're concerned about is the mixing
the two together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, the cannabis opens up your
lungs and it allows all those really bad
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are put on into its back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and that just that those chemicals
that result of tobacco combustion,
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't need to be breathing that in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't add to the experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's again, it's a cultural thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you know, I think it's it ties back
to the use of tobacco and hookahs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It became the norm in in Spain before the
cannabis culture really got going in Spain
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of in the late 90s, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a hash consuming country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that they would get hash from
Morocco and they'd mix it with tobacco and
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd smoke it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that became the norm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both countries are really quite accepting
of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a cultural norm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even in Holland, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know if you've ever been to
Amsterdam, but if you go to a coffee shop
[SPEAKER_04]: in Amsterdam, you'll see a Dutch guy come
in from the end of his workday and he'll
[SPEAKER_04]: sit down and ask for a half gram or a gram
of hash from the dealer and they'll take
[SPEAKER_04]: out a full cigarette and have one of these
long jumbo size papers and they break the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire cigarette out and they might take,
you know, a tenth of a gram or two tenths
[SPEAKER_04]: of a gram and break up the hash into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they roll that in their entire
cigarette and smoke the whole thing to
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the taste of that alone would be
enough for me to say just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from a health perspective,
I think that it really makes the worst
[SPEAKER_04]: things about the tobacco more harmful.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So from a harm reduction perspective,
don't smoke tobacco with your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: From a taste perspective, Jesus,
please don't smoke tobacco with your
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And listen, I grew up in Ottawa,
which is very close to Montreal,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a port city kind of on the
eastern side of Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we would have a lot of hashish that
would come in through the Montreal port,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, being like two or two and a half
hours away.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the predominant form of cannabis
that was available when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't until I was a little bit
older that we started seeing some cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then, whether it was the police or
the genetics that were available to be
[SPEAKER_04]: grown outside or the availability,
you know, the lack of supply, all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: things together created the situation
where we just didn't have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were hash smokers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I lived right on the border of Quebec,
which is the French speaking part of
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a lot of ties back to
France, of course, culturally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, in France, you know,
it's in between Spain and Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also hash smokers and great
tobacco smokers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe as our, you know,
I came to a point where I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try and stop not smoking with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was buying cigarettes just to have
tobacco to mix in with my joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I got to the point where I
was like, forget this, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_04]: start smoking with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember I was a music band at the
time and some of my friends that were in
[SPEAKER_04]: the band, they were like, oh, we can't,
it's too harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you smoke it without, it's too harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it feels that way for about the first
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after you get accustomed to smoking
without cannabis, you actually change the
[SPEAKER_04]: way that you smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: You draw the air differently in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you, rather than taking these long
draws on the joint, you take smaller draws
[SPEAKER_04]: with larger breaths of air at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're kind of titrating down the smoke
and you get to the point where,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you just, it tastes so much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't go back if you had to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when someone passes you a joint,
like if I'm, you know, if I'm out at a
[SPEAKER_04]: party, say I'm on the East side of Canada,
again, smoking with tobacco is a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: prominent than it is on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're at a party, someone
passes you a joint and you have a taste of
[SPEAKER_04]: it, or you get, you know, you get it
halfway down your throat and your lungs
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately slam shut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they just don't want that tobacco
smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I, I'm really against it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really against tobacco as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I think it's, I've seen the
damage it does to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just don't think it's a good thing
to be consuming if you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you certainly don't need to be
consuming it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like putting orange juice
in a fine wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many things you just said, which I just
so heavily relate to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just agree with everything you
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as someone who's never smoked a
cigarette in my life, but at one point was
[SPEAKER_01]: addicted to tobacco purely through smoking
it with weed, I think that I can agree
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That after you get through that first two
weeks, you're like, wow, this is such a
[SPEAKER_01]: better world to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd love to just quickly jump back to
something you touched on because we did
[SPEAKER_01]: have one of the friends of the show,
Dire Wolf submit a question, which relates
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly to the hash sort of comment you
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was wondering, what's your thoughts
on the old school Moroccan imported hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you love it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you stand?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like everything in the
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I love it for what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to Morocco a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I've traveled there a little bit on my
own and I actually went with Rob Clark and
[SPEAKER_04]: we had a little trip and went and saw some
growers that we knew down there and really
[SPEAKER_04]: got to see all about the culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great thing to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think from, you know, when I went the
last time, I had already been working in
[SPEAKER_04]: these regulated models.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I started going back and seeing
the way that things were done on such a
[SPEAKER_04]: massive scale, there's a lot of gross
things that are, you know, there's no real
[SPEAKER_04]: high, just no real sense of hygiene in the
process or in the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not really thought of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen through some of the studies
that have been done even in like Dutch
[SPEAKER_04]: coffee shops that, you know, for example,
like if you're trimming your weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: someone goes off to the washroom,
doesn't wash their hands after they use
[SPEAKER_04]: the washroom, you can get like E.
[SPEAKER_04]: coli on the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty gross.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not it's it's completely
avoidable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these systems, they don't they
don't they don't have any of these safety
[SPEAKER_04]: protocols.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have standard operating
procedures.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have protocols for maintaining
the quality of the flower from a consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: safety perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing about it is it's the
market has changed so even even the first
[SPEAKER_04]: time I went, which is I think it was 2011.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might even have been a little before
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But around that time, it was they were
going through a transition where the
[SPEAKER_04]: Moroccans had started adopting advanced
agricultural techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, they were growing
feminized seeds from Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: But rather than just scatter seed,
I mean, the way they used to do it,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd they'd harvest all the seeds at the
end of the year when you when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: harvesting acres of cannabis and seeded
like Moroccan is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You separate the the the resins from the
plants, right, through screening or this
[SPEAKER_04]: this batter beating technique,
which I don't know if you've seen online,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, you know, people can Google it and
you can look on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: They essentially put it in a bag and then
they beat the bag with sticks and the
[SPEAKER_04]: sticks, knock the resin glands off the
flower and then they collect the resin
[SPEAKER_04]: glands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no real there's no real safety
consideration in doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for them, they all know that it's
black market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the truth is, if you're up in Morocco,
up in the in the rift mountains and you
[SPEAKER_04]: have land like you're paying for your
house and your way of life and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: by with cannabis, I mean, if you go up
there and you drive around, you'll see
[SPEAKER_04]: driving through the rift.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest houses, they're all surrounded
by cannabis fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is what the point was,
is that they're they're bringing in these
[SPEAKER_04]: feminized seeds and now they lay drip
emitters down and they plant the feminized
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds on drip lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas what they used to do is harvest
all the seeds after they beat the resin
[SPEAKER_04]: glands off the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd collect the seeds and then the next
year they would actually just walk around
[SPEAKER_04]: the property with bags of seeds and
scatter seed them by just tossing out
[SPEAKER_04]: handfuls of seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get a lot of it's kind of grown a
little bit more like hemp than they do
[SPEAKER_04]: drug cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a lot more plants per square foot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow very tall and thin.
[SPEAKER_04]: With top colas and not a lot of side
branching.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of the traditional
method of of production for farmers in
[SPEAKER_04]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you go down and you go up into the
rift, you'll see they've got these like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they've dug into the side of
these mountains like pretty much Olympic
[SPEAKER_04]: swimming pool size pools to hold the
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it rains in the winter,
they collect all that water and they line
[SPEAKER_04]: them with with big plastics, big plastic
or rubber mats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that holds all the water in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have these huge reservoirs for
which to feed their plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they take that water and they pump it
out and they inject chemical nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: from a lot of it comes from Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's that is that same kind
of chemical fertilizers that everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: else in the blue crystals kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the the the places that they're
growing in Morocco, it's not even really
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more rock and dust than anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any kind of organic material in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they really just turn it into a
massive hydroponic hydroponic bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the drippers providing all the
nutrients that the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, growing feminized seeds by the
10, 20, 30 acre plot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not a lot of love given to the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about bulk.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand the concept of,
you know, you know, Howard Marks,
[SPEAKER_04]: funnily enough, went through the same
thing in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he was there, he was asking for,
you know, I don't want as much hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want better quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just didn't understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, we'll just we'll just make
more.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, no, we don't want more.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually want less of the stuff that we
don't want in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do I think that those things will be
available as they are in the new market?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably not the best way of doing
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you take those production practices
and make them applicable or safe to do in
[SPEAKER_04]: a regulated market?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make products like the Moroccan
hashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people will love those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, just transferring over the way
that it's always been done into the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see it happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: In line with what you just mentioned is
what's your opinion on people going to
[SPEAKER_01]: these sort of land race or indigenous
areas and trading modern feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics for the cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like notably strain hunters and Aryan have
done that a lot and they cop a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: flack for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's deserved or do you
think it's not as harmful as people might
[SPEAKER_01]: make out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think there's two things to
realize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, Morocco, cannabis
wasn't grown in Morocco until like 1300
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were brought those populations
were brought there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really what they were growing even till a
couple of hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe 150 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it wasn't even that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been less.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were it was actually really a hemp
variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't they weren't really potent
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why they made it into hashish
because it concentrated enough that you'd
[SPEAKER_04]: get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Moroccans, that's not how that
they would consume their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to this day, they still don't consume
the resin glands.
[SPEAKER_04]: They mix flour tops with little bits of
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how they smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not it's not used the way we smoke it
to consume the same concentration of the
[SPEAKER_04]: drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of again, like maybe like DJ's
ways that they were they were they were
[SPEAKER_04]: using a less amount of the drug and just
to get a slight effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the that was the really the
purpose for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truthfully, the DEA has gone around the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they've spent the last maybe not
the last 20 years, but certainly the 20
[SPEAKER_04]: years before that going around the world
and paying the Thai government and paying
[SPEAKER_04]: the Indian government and paying the
Afghanistan government to go out and
[SPEAKER_04]: conduct anti cannabis raids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go go and have these programs to go and
cut the fields down.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, at one point in time,
it was the UN the the UN Office of Drug
[SPEAKER_04]: Control.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was their policy to actually make
cannabis extinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that was one of the UN's world goals
was to make cannabis extinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like imagine the UN's having one of their
mandates to make a species go and say it's
[SPEAKER_04]: extinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just bizarre.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was all ideologically driven.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the truth is, is that most of
the cannabis that's been grown in those
[SPEAKER_04]: land, what people call land race
populations and the cultures that grew
[SPEAKER_04]: those land races, for example,
the Thai culture that grew the the really
[SPEAKER_04]: fine Thai sticks, that's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like those things just don't really exist
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might have like little dots of them
around the country in very small spots,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's not a cultural phenomenon like it
used to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a way of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the lessons that they had to teach,
the cultural practice they had to teach,
[SPEAKER_04]: those ways are probably gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: The genetics, at least the diversity is
mostly gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from a farming point of view,
I mean, if you're a farmer in Thailand or
[SPEAKER_04]: India or the Congo, you know, you're
talking about the strain hunters.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a farmer in those places,
you want the best product that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if somebody has a variety of corn
that yields 10 times as much, and that
[SPEAKER_04]: means that you can have 10 times as much,
you know, profit or return from your crop
[SPEAKER_04]: or 10 times as much food to feed your
family, you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these folks probably don't
understand the the the intricacies of
[SPEAKER_04]: protecting the global diversity of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of the way we are in most
of these species with most species now is
[SPEAKER_04]: that these centers of origin, as we call
them, or centers of diversity of most crop
[SPEAKER_04]: species are gone or they're threatened all
around all around the world just because
[SPEAKER_04]: of human activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at this point in time, we really
rely on what we call ex situ or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, collections that are taken and
kept out of the place where they were
[SPEAKER_04]: produced because the environment's
changing and these these ecosystems are
[SPEAKER_04]: threatened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, the point that we have to
do that now is that we just have to
[SPEAKER_04]: collect these things as they are and try
to preserve the diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that if we're trying to blame
Arian or blame anybody for going and
[SPEAKER_04]: polluting the polluting these germplasm,
these genetic pools, the truth is those
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic pools are mostly depleted anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those farmers have have, you know,
I think it's kind of hard to argue that
[SPEAKER_04]: those farmers don't have every right that
all the local cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: all our domestic cannabis growers to to to
produce the newest, most commercially
[SPEAKER_04]: viable plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they that's what farmers want
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to stay competitive.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, when if you if
you look at it on a human level,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can totally relate to the point you
made about, you know, people are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: feed their families.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not it's not all this like
grand oversight driven sort of actions
[SPEAKER_01]: taking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: An idea that one of our past guests,
Erisun, brought up, and he's a lovely guy
[SPEAKER_01]: from India who's done some land race
expeditions and preservation efforts of
[SPEAKER_01]: his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: He raised this interesting idea,
which I think makes a lot of sense to me
[SPEAKER_01]: in that he said, as you pointed out,
these these cultivars are disappearing on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like strain hunters is the sole
reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he raised this idea of like,
if you do have these seeds, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: your due diligence to try to get them out
there and not just sit on the stock
[SPEAKER_01]: forever and like sort of hoard it in a
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like that's an idea you can
get down with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I mean, and that's kind of,
you know, it's it's it's interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: because, again, we have systems in the
world for regulating the use of plants or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, for example, you have kind of
overseas the naming and describing of what
[SPEAKER_04]: is a different plant type.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they award, you know, rights to the
plant breeders for, you know, you breed a
[SPEAKER_04]: new apple, for example, you get the
commercial rights to produce that apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the things that comes up with
that is that, yeah, you get the 20 years
[SPEAKER_04]: of commercial rights to grow that apple
and profit from it exclusively.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the trade off is that you have to make
that apple tree available to other plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea behind that is that plant
genetic resources are really a global,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I'm going to call them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say it's a human right to use
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that humans kind of we put
ourselves first on the planet a little too
[SPEAKER_04]: much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the truth is, is that everybody on the
planet has the right to access different
[SPEAKER_04]: types of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you protect if you invent a new plant
and you want to you want to get
[SPEAKER_04]: intellectual property rights on it,
that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, that's fine to get the
commercial rights to benefit from that
[SPEAKER_04]: exclusively.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also do have the duty to maintain
these plants and plant species and plant
[SPEAKER_04]: populations in a way where they're more
accessible to everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, call it an echo of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it echoes of prohibition being the
things that we believe that we're still
[SPEAKER_04]: doing wrong because we learn to do them
through prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the echoes of prohibition is,
oh, if you want that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want the seed that I have,
then you have to pay me for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of just the way it is,
you know, and so I have all these
[SPEAKER_04]: populations and I, you know, the idea is
to eventually get them all out and share
[SPEAKER_04]: them all in some regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it took a lot of work to create to
collect these things, and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: pass them on to someone that doesn't know
how to preserve them properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the idea, again, is that we're
we're really custodians of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not ours.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't like no plant breeder owns all
the cannabis that they have.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that you're a custodian for it
for the future generations of people that
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's a really important
attitude to have when when going about
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis preservation work is that,
no, it's not your alcohol gold or your
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexican variety or your Indian variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like these, you know, these seeds
have cultural heritage attached to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's there's history and people
that preserve them.
[SPEAKER_04]: For us, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, there's, you know, there's
something called the CBD, which is funnily
[SPEAKER_04]: enough, the CBD is the.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it again?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having a mind mind moment here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not recognizing what it is,
but essentially it's like a a program of
[SPEAKER_04]: biological diversity, an agreement of
biological diversity between all these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants or all these countries to protect
the diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what's typically happened is
Western countries have gone to these poor
[SPEAKER_04]: third world countries looking for plants
to collect and take back and turn them
[SPEAKER_04]: into a pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the culture that maintain that plant
or discovered that plant, they don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: any benefit from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't they don't earn any benefit
from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's something called the Nagoya
Protocol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people can, again, do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Nagoya Protocol essentially says
for all the signatory countries that if
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if you're a Spanish company or
you're a Dutch company, they're both
[SPEAKER_04]: signatories.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just go down to Africa and start
pilfering seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then taking them back and profiting
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that sense, you know, it could well
be that Ariane is actually violating that
[SPEAKER_04]: protocol, that protocol, that agreement
that his government has signed to where if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to go down and exploit that
genetic diversity or that cultural
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity, that genetic diversity that's
produced by the culture, that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: entitled to some of the profits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just stops the more advanced
countries of the world or the more
[SPEAKER_04]: developed countries of the world from
going around and exploiting the the folks
[SPEAKER_04]: that aren't quite as developed yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think history has shown that a lot
of the less developed countries have sadly
[SPEAKER_01]: copped the short end of the stick without
these sort of regulations in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully our buddy Ariane hasn't
violated any laws in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question I'd just love to run by before
we jump back to the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, is on the topic of indigenous
land races, one of the really good
[SPEAKER_01]: questions we got from one of our listeners
was they were interested in knowing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in line with Iris and a former
guest of ours having done some land race
[SPEAKER_01]: expeditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did hint that there are still some
indigenous stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously just near and far when you
come across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any indigenous cultivars or land
race strengths or grains that in your mind
[SPEAKER_01]: you would really love to work with if you
had the chance?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it would be really nice to
be able to go back to those varieties of
[SPEAKER_04]: yesterday with the technologies of today
and start doing some real exploring using
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got little collections of relatively
exotic things in the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some ties and some Mexicans,
the Highland Mexican, and some other,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, all different Colombians and all
these different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The truth is, when you start exploring
land race population, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: dogs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of plants that are way
substandard in there for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so honestly, it's kind of a hassle to
be working with land race populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're breeding modern-day corn,
you don't go back to the varieties that
[SPEAKER_04]: were collected out of the wilds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Teosantes of the world,
because you're losing all that genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: progress that you've created, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The breeders of the world that have
ushered cannabis to us in the state that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's in today, yeah, they've made a lot of
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, they're typically not
professionally trained scientific plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders like the rest of the world's
crops, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis world is kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like plant breeders are celebrities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know any celebrity wheat
breeders or corn breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of bred by like big-time
nerds, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is great, but it's just kind of the
way it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we try to work with, you know,
we go back to those what you call land
[SPEAKER_04]: race populations or those more wild
populations, typically in a plant breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: project, when you're looking for a trait
that has been lost over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, corn in the United States
went through this vast bottlenecking
[SPEAKER_04]: process because they were trying to make
these high-yielding sweet corn varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They created these incredibly bulletproof
sweet corn varieties that were
[SPEAKER_04]: high-yielding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you'd produce 50 times the
amount of corn per acre as you would if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're using a variety, say, from 20,
30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the things that they realized
is that the plants became susceptible to
[SPEAKER_04]: pests in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the roots would be attacked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the roots, essentially, they had lost
these compounds that would protect them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of those compounds was
beta-karyophylline, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: major sesquiterpines that's produced by
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in all the Kush varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG, Baba, all that kind of stuff is high
in beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_04]: And beta-karyophylline makes the roots
unpalatable to certain aphids,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they accidentally bred it out
because they were so focused on the big
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet corn that the other traits that they
weren't really paying attention to,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of them got lost along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they had to actually, when they
realized, hey, all the modern corn doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: produce beta-karyophylline in the roots,
they now had to go way back in time in
[SPEAKER_04]: their breeding programs to find plants
that had those to try and re-introgress
[SPEAKER_04]: that trait back into the population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think, for me, that that's really
where the major benefits are going to come
[SPEAKER_04]: from those land-race lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're probably getting some
interesting head spaces, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: because the plants are in the 8% to 10%
THC range, not the 20-plus THC range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe some of them have unique or
interesting terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: But funnily enough, most of that stuff has
actually been preserved pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because growers and smokers have always
liked the interesting-smelling plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's always been one grower that's,
you know, he was like, I really like this
[SPEAKER_04]: type of smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that pursuit, he's managed to breed
for the predominance of one terpene over
[SPEAKER_04]: another, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so right now, we actually have an
incredible amount of genetic diversity and
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor, whereas the plant is probably most
going to be able to be improved in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of things like disease resistance and pest
resistance, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Resistance to powdery mildew, botrytis,
yada, yada, yada, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's many subjects we'll touch on
in the near future of this chat,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially preserving old-school skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I want to talk about with
you for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do that, let's go back to
the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone had brought some hash to a party
and it was, you know, it was rolled in a
[SPEAKER_04]: joint with some tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I felt a little high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we smoked it and we went
outside for a walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember feeling weird on this walk
as we went from one party to another.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it wasn't really that of a profound
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of came away from the whole thing
thinking, well, that wasn't really a big
[SPEAKER_04]: deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it became something that we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'd go over to my friend Costa's
house on weekends and his older brother,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, would get us the hash and we
would sit around and listen to Led
[SPEAKER_04]: Zeppelin and smoke hash joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wasn't really about the diversity
and the flavors for me then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember then, you know, I had met
another girl in school, just a friend of
[SPEAKER_04]: mine, and her older brother was a dealer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, you know, you smoke
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should introduce you to my brother
because he's got really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this kid became my connection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had all this like exotic stuff that
I'd never seen before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he had the purple weed that I'd never
seen for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Manali finger sticks and
these like kind of surfboard looking flat
[SPEAKER_04]: plate hash joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the kind of brushes that were
imported.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever reason through his connections,
he just happened to have all this kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: First time I saw really nice indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I saw like a cherry oil,
you know, all these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I met this guy, he really
opened my eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was actually quite instrumental in
my future cannabis use because a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: years in knowing him, he had a couple of
guys breaking into his house in the middle
[SPEAKER_04]: of the night with a shotgun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they took all of his weed and all of
his money and they kidnapped his roommate
[SPEAKER_04]: and left his roommate, you know,
100 kilometers outside of town on the side
[SPEAKER_04]: of a road and across streets in his
underwear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was enough for my my my friend's
older brother to be like, I want nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: to do with this business anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out, which really sucked because I had
learned to have this appreciation for all
[SPEAKER_04]: the diversity that he had and showed me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was forced to go back on the
street to try and find things of
[SPEAKER_04]: significant quality like he had.
[SPEAKER_04]: He always had the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I learned within about eight months or
12 months that most other dealers didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: care about buying them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got to imagine like for any
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a wholesale market, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the wholesale market has a variation
in price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can pay for the really expensive
stuff, but a lot of the dealers are at
[SPEAKER_04]: least the ones that I need.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all want to buy the lower price stuff
because they could make a higher margin on
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really contrary to my goals,
right, which was to have the really nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: the really nice flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of right before I
entered university and and was getting out
[SPEAKER_04]: on my own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that point in time, it was like,
well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that these things exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to be that you can clearly
produce them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The channels that I have are clearly not
interested in bringing those things to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to start growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I went out and I bought every grow
book that I could find and some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I read them all cover to cover,
like, you know, way too many times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the beginning of this what's
become an obsessive, insane pursuit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, for over the past 30
years, I think the first 15 or 20 of them,
[SPEAKER_04]: most of the people that I knew thought
that I was insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, why are you spending all of
your time focusing on all this weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, you know, I could have done a
lot of different things, I think,
[SPEAKER_04]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for a lot of people to see me
focusing all that attention on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they thought was a waste of my
potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, funnily enough, the world turned
around and they all realized that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just ahead of my time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, you know, that we have a legal
industry, I'm able to you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: positively influence the industry through
this massive gene collection that I've
got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which has always been what I've been
interested in doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, I got when this system
developed in Canada, all the pubco is when
[SPEAKER_04]: I was offered millions of dollars for my
seed collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, when someone offers you
multiple millions of dollars, you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: seriously think about, you know,
why you're doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do you take the big payout and
then just go and live a comfortable life?
[SPEAKER_04]: But the truth was is that that's never why
I collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do all the work collecting all
these seeds because I had hoped that one
[SPEAKER_04]: day that there would be a payout.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it because I loved it and I enjoyed
what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I turned all these offers down
because it became about, no, I don't I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not looking for a buyout.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for a home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a place where I can actually get a
farm and some nice greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_04]: actually take all this hard work that I've
put into collecting all these things and
[SPEAKER_04]: start bringing them back to the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you get these things out and share
them with the world?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the new world is really about
dealing with the regulatory challenges to
[SPEAKER_04]: make that happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you how do you sell seeds
internationally legally?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you do all the stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have to when you start working
in a regulated system, you can't live in
[SPEAKER_04]: both worlds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be one foot in the black market
and one foot in the legal world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's really about about the work
and not the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good it was a good lesson to
learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good thing to kind of be faced
with and come to the realization that,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do this for the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it because I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I so so much vibe with that message
because so often a lot of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions that get made that lead to
deleterious outcomes in cannabis are done
[SPEAKER_01]: because people are looking to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as kind of as much as it might
irritate some people, I always kind of say
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's worth considering having a day
job so that you don't have to grow a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain cultivar because you need to pay
the rent with the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it gives you that freedom to be able
to pursue your passions and not like the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it becomes about the again,
the artistry or the artisanal aspect of
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever your art is, whether it's playing
and making guitars or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: raising and curing pork or vegetables or
cheese or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all, you know, there's some people
that are doing it for money and the
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial aspect for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some people doing it just
to make the finest product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what they enjoy doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like having the finest cheese in the
world or the finest wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that there's, you know,
a lot of people say, oh, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, you're a scientist.
[SPEAKER_04]: You breed weed from a scientific
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, well, true enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm also an artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you can if you're an artist,
you can use science as a tool in your
[SPEAKER_04]: toolbox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like just like a specific type of
type of paint or a specific paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you're using science,
it doesn't mean that you can't do the art.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aspect of it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, it's a it's a fusion of those
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The science is just a set of tools that
help you execute your art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we kind of touch on that same theme,
what was your first grow like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I find the viewers are always extremely
interested in hearing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, do you remember the first strain you
ever grew and the sort of technology was
[SPEAKER_01]: it like sort of all MacGyvered together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a little rundown if you can
remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wasn't it wasn't a known or a named
seed lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was you're probably noticing I don't
use the word strain and we can touch on
[SPEAKER_04]: that after.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it wasn't a known variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a labeled variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was seeds that I got out of some bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was young.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like too young to be growing weed
that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd heard stories of family members that
had grown weed in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just kind of grabbed some seeds and
I was like, I started them and I told my
[SPEAKER_04]: parents and they're, you know,
one of my parents were separate at that
[SPEAKER_04]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't live together any longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I said to my mom,
I said, yeah, I'm going to grow some
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that really what happened is
she was like, yeah, OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking that I would completely fail,
of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was I was still in high
school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was, you know, I think I was 14 or
15 at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom was going to be rolling or rolling
or upset if she hears me tell this
[SPEAKER_04]: publicly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, that's another conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so I said, I started growing these
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the hydra store and they set me
up with a, you know, I told them,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we're growing some tomatoes at
our house and I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, OK, well, they sold me
a one foot by four foot kind of like a
[SPEAKER_04]: window box tray and and a slab of rock
wall that fit perfectly into that one foot
[SPEAKER_04]: by four foot tray.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a bucket and a pump and and a short
piece of hose that became the drip dripper
[SPEAKER_04]: line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just, you know, we designed it into
the what I later came to learn was a
[SPEAKER_04]: recirculating drip system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Took it home, put it in the window,
planted a couple of seeds right into the
[SPEAKER_04]: medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the next year and a half,
I had these stupid unhealthy plants in my
[SPEAKER_04]: basement beside my guitars and all my
friends coming over to smoked up on the
[SPEAKER_04]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would turn the lights off when I
would go to bed and I'd turn them on when
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd get up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these plants, of course,
never flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't getting any kind of
consistent light cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, I think it must have been
like it must have been like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: 13, 14 months or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, my mom was sad enough and
she's like, those have to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I moved him down to my dad's house
and put him in a window that happened to
[SPEAKER_04]: be west facing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just coincidentally, it happened to be
fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plants flowered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we cut them down and it was terrible
smoke because the genetics were crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but but it was a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, huh, you can actually get
these things through to the cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put it away for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even really think about it again,
because it didn't again, it didn't turn
[SPEAKER_04]: out well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was living at my parents,
my folks house.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I moved out on my own,
I was like, I'm going to figure this thing
[SPEAKER_04]: out and learn how to do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second time I started growing,
I went and bought a little 400 watt light
[SPEAKER_04]: from the grow store.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think I was growing in 20
liter buckets, reading the old Mel Frank
[SPEAKER_04]: books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ed Rosenthal's all books.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, obviously marijuana botany
was my Bible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just went from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started screening and I remember going
down to the hydro store and I was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: friends with the guy and I subtly said to
him, I was like, hey, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you think I can get some clones?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, and he gave me the stock answer
was, you know, he's like, no, we don't do
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of growing cannabis is cutting
your teeth on seeds and finding some good
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and working with those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went and went insane with buying seeds
and started growing all these different
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about a year later, he was asking me
for cuttings because I had better,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I'd found better plants than
what they were growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized that I really liked that,
that part of the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was, you know, I was in university
and started, I think I had a genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that point on, I just got right
into it and was almost immediately
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing, you know, I brought,
I brought the, the flowers that I had
[SPEAKER_04]: produced back to the store front that was
selling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, wow, your flowers are
really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can I get some seeds from these?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I made a couple of crosses and I
donated them to one of the early medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis challenges that were going on in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sold them through this head shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the feedback was really good,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had found excellent plants for,
for the parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just having a little bit of knowledge
from, you know, my plant breeding courses
[SPEAKER_04]: or my genetics course, I was able to make
better choices for what constitutes a good
[SPEAKER_04]: parent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the seeds turned out well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, when I went in one day and
the guy was like, man, your seeds are
[SPEAKER_04]: getting great reviews from all these
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want you to start making more seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of just fit in really good
with what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of from the start, like I didn't
really grow cannabis to have largest
[SPEAKER_04]: amount to sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always just became the guy that was
growing lots of plants from seed and
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping clones and finding interesting
plants and, and working for them that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it, it, I found it really enjoyable,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I, that's kind of what I love about
cannabis is there's such a diversity in
[SPEAKER_04]: the morphological and chemical profiles,
the scent, as you know, the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: everything like it's, it really is a
remarkable plant in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlike many types of plants, which are
much more uniform and less diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so cannabis has got so much that we
can do with it, that it's really kind of a
[SPEAKER_04]: fun plant to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing which jumps to mind for me when
I hear that amazing story is obviously a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people talk about having looked at
Rob Clark's books and people of that early
[SPEAKER_01]: generation who really laid a lot of the,
the paving for future breeders and for
[SPEAKER_01]: future growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing about Rob was he wasn't like
as notable of a breeder as he was sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a guru and an instructor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there specific particularly any
breeders who you looked at when you
[SPEAKER_01]: started your projects and thought this
person has a good feel for what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were kind of like a, like,
you know, a figure you looked up to in a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I met Sam pretty early on,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he kind of, we, we kind of connected
over the internet because he, I think he
[SPEAKER_04]: recognized, he was like, wow, this person
knows what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I went over to Canada, the cannabis
cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what year it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty early on and I met,
I met Sam and when he found out who I was,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he was kind of taken back that I
was much younger than he had thought that
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and he kind of like brushed me off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he was a little bit like
dismissive of me and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I don't know this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got, I remember leaving,
you know, completing my trip and coming
[SPEAKER_04]: back home and I went home and found an
email waiting from Dave, from,
[SPEAKER_04]: from Dave saying, Sam David, and he,
and he essentially apologized to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm sorry, I was kind of rude
to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, next time you come back
to Amsterdam, you come over to my house
[SPEAKER_04]: for dinner and I got a bunch of stuff to
show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't know most,
a lot of people might not realize,
[SPEAKER_04]: but he was also the president or founder
of the international hemp association.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was a pretty central figure in the
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his connections are just so deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I honestly don't know if I've ever met
anybody more than, than David that is more
[SPEAKER_04]: passionate about cannabis than David.
[SPEAKER_04]: He really is like, you know, a lot of
people slag him on the internet and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's all these stupid, just totally
wrong rumors about him working for the DEA
[SPEAKER_04]: and the CIA that get passed around about
him online.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I got to tell you,
it's just not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all that stuff is just, it's all got
like tiny little bases in reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, for example, like he did
when he started, he was licensed to work
[SPEAKER_04]: in Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the university of Mississippi,
which was the only licensed DEA grow at
[SPEAKER_04]: the time, they wanted to get genetics to
improve their, their work.
[SPEAKER_04]: They reached out to David and said,
Hey, we're doing science over here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Mississippi and university in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you send us some seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're, you're legally allowed to grow
them in Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you export some to the States?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they went and got it, you know,
they're a DEA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Licensed producer in the States.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're one of the only ones, or I think
they're the only one now, but there used
[SPEAKER_04]: to be two and the DEA granted them an
import permit to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so David was able to export seeds from
Horta farm, his company into the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States completely legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But somehow the community thought,
Oh, well, David's working with the DEA.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got these abilities to do these
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the truth was, is that he,
of course he wasn't working with the DEA.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nobody that would work with the
DEA less than David, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's completely on board for the
cause.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's not helping out the CIA or the
DEA.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just stoner nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but there was a lot of animosity
towards David because he had figured out
[SPEAKER_04]: how to do legally what everybody else
couldn't do, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They were, everybody else was playing in
the, in the black market world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had learned how he'd figured it
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: How to get a grow licensed, how to do
research on plants, how to start looking
[SPEAKER_04]: into the different chemical profiles in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The truth is, is he was like one of the
very, very first people in the Western
[SPEAKER_04]: world that was promoting medical cannabis
or the medical use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he firmly believed that you could,
you could take all these plants and create
[SPEAKER_04]: all these different chemical profiles from
them when nobody else even was even close
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just, he's just a great guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a weirdo for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll tell you that straight out of
his own mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he's really quite eccentric,
but he is super smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is super focused on cannabis and
collecting as many different types as he
[SPEAKER_04]: can from all over the world and learning
about the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, he's in his seventies and he
sucks up information, all the new
[SPEAKER_04]: information, like a vacuum cleaner.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, you know, as a role model from
people to look, to look at from,
[SPEAKER_04]: as I was kind of starting my career,
he and Rob, I mean, there was no better,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was no better people to know,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I got to learn through him to the
truth behind the Dutch seed company at the
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, these stories of these
massive breeding houses in Holland doing
[SPEAKER_04]: work on seeds is that's nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, it's a fable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not, it's not what happens,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these guys produce seeds in
closets and it's no different than the
[SPEAKER_04]: work than anybody else is doing anywhere
else in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that they can legally sell the
seeds and create a marketing, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective that makes it look like
they're doing the work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the truth is they're not doing the
work, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So David was really one of the only people
that were, you know, he built a lab
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: He started looking for THC and CBD and all
these other cannabinoids and they even
[SPEAKER_04]: started looking at terpenes like way
before their time, way before anybody else
[SPEAKER_04]: was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, I think you're asking who my,
the people I looked up to, it would be
[SPEAKER_04]: those guys, you know, other people in the
Canadian space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just collect everybody's seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would buy seeds and sell seeds and it
was all about just getting everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't any ego attached to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first person that I was kind of really
excited to work with was DJ, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that was kind of fun because he was
just, you know, his stuff was just so
[SPEAKER_04]: different than everybody else's.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from a genetic diversity point of
view, I thought that it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was a good addition to your,
your pool of what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a whole new little subset of
genetics to create hybrids with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but by that point in time,
I was starting to be really
[SPEAKER_04]: disenfranchised with the rest of the seed
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think for most people, I don't,
you know, there's a few people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: doing it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Simon, serious seed Simon,
he's, um, he's not a trained plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder, but he really understands what
he's doing and he, he understands trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to create a uniform product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, uh, you know, I think his work
is really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, some of the younger guys, there's a
lot of younger guys that are know what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Caleb from, uh, CSI seeds,
he does some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's a whole bunch of people that
are doing it right now and that are
[SPEAKER_04]: starting to do, I think we're kind of in a
bit of a Renaissance for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people that are just
hacking plants together and creating an
[SPEAKER_04]: image and you know, being really popular
on Instagram and that that's all fine and
[SPEAKER_04]: dandy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think for the most of those people,
it's about making money, not really about
[SPEAKER_04]: improving the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I'd like to see more of these
people invest in a couple of plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: plant breeding textbooks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And put some effort into trying to learn
about, you know, the biological basis for,
[SPEAKER_04]: for plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you understand all that
stuff, you can just, you're really more
[SPEAKER_04]: effective in your work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I think that the people that
really care about the plant and improving
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant, they do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the people that are more
concerned about the money and the
[SPEAKER_04]: celebrity don't really do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a plethora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of avenues we could go down in terms of
the discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we jump onto some of the other
breeders you mentioned, I'd love to just
[SPEAKER_01]: chat about David a little more,
if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically, I think the question,
which I most commonly hear around that
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of DEA mystery sort of thing is that
I think a lot of people have a hard time
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how that story about how the
warehouse got raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like he was him or his colleagues
were able to like get the plants out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any reflections or insight
into that story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you think he just got lucky or
what do you think the situation was with
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: The story's not even true.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the funny thing is that David was
involved with, I think he technically
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't even involved in the bust.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had moved to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he went over to start work in
Amsterdam, um, was kind of exploring it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, if you were in the drug
scene and you heard that cannabis that
[SPEAKER_04]: Holland was popping off and you can go
there, grow weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was a pretty exciting thing
for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he went over there and started doing
some work and you know, realized,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, this is the place for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to go back to California and close
up my life there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm moving over to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he went back and you know,
got all their stuff dealt with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he moved to Holland and his wife
at the time got busted and it wasn't the
[SPEAKER_04]: wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was their roommate had a male plant in
the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the, oh, and so David,
but David wasn't even there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only California like cannabis
bus that even has any remotely closeness
[SPEAKER_04]: to David.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so all these stories about like the
sacred seed collective and all the,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is just, these are nonsense stories
that people just make up on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I've done, you know, I've,
I, I'm a pretty untrusting person when it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to things like this of history.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've done a little bit of looking into
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tell you, man, he's not like that
didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know about the story and the
warehouse and the plants and saving the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to me, it sounds like internet
fantasy, but there's no basis in reality
[SPEAKER_04]: to it as far as I'm aware.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've asked him all these questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I've asked David all the hard
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, cause I wanted to get to the basis of
it and the answers are always very like
[SPEAKER_04]: it's, you know, you know, the concept of
Occam's razor or parsimony, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the simplest explanation is
usually the true one.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that with it, listen,
I've had people do it with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably get to that later in the
episode, but there's a lot of fantastical
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that's written about me on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just has no basis in reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I, you know, no getting to know
David as I have over the last 20 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe any of this, that stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talk to other, you know,
I've been able to go back and meet like
[SPEAKER_04]: other people that he worked with in
California and you know, he knew Rob back
[SPEAKER_04]: in the day and I've talked to Rob about
all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, I think that a lot of it
spurred from the fact that he was able to
[SPEAKER_04]: get these licenses that nobody else was
able to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, when GW pharmaceuticals got the go
ahead from, um, the home office in the
[SPEAKER_04]: United States to set up a grow and start
working there, obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause they understood that there,
there was pharmaceutical potential in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they started doing everything that
you would do to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You set up a grow, you start doing some
science, you make some extractions,
[SPEAKER_04]: you figure out what molecules are in the
plant and you start testing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they needed a genetic supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: They needed to turn to somebody in the
world and say, Hey, do you have these rare
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties with all these different
chemistries?
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, they found Horta farm
because Horta farm was the only company in
[SPEAKER_04]: the world that was doing that work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, David had David kept Horta
farm alive with his own.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't, he didn't have a bunch of
people giving him money, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there was no public markets for
raising funds to support that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: business.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was doing it with his own work and
paying for that kind of work with his,
[SPEAKER_04]: his legal seed sales, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seed sales were always legal in,
in Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he was able to sell some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pay for, you know, pay to do his work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when GW really approached him,
Horta farm was struggling, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's really, it's really
expensive, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you start doing science on cannabis,
I mean, you're spending like 50,
[SPEAKER_04]: a hundred dollars for a lab test.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're running, you know,
thousands or even tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, that gets really, really expensive
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're legal, your compliance
costs are huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have security.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have, you know, record
keeping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, it's not, it's not done the way
that people in the black market do without
[SPEAKER_04]: having all these different reporting
duties and regulatory duties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when, when GW came along,
they offered Horta farm a lifeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was really a lifeline at that
point in time so that David could keep
[SPEAKER_04]: doing the work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he had staffing costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had, they had, it was running a
business when you're not making an income
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're doing research is a really
really difficult thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think people really understand
that if you haven't done it, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's kind of what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because he was doing that and because,
you know, the communities always thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, big pharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the evil people.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guys that run GW, they like helping
patients just like anybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a few of the scientists work for
that company and they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear them tell stories that bring you
probably know some people that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they produce weed and they give
it away to a medical patient of one type
[SPEAKER_04]: or another child that's got epilepsy or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get a lot of pride from doing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's really kind of no better
feeling than, than helping someone with
[SPEAKER_04]: your work with a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you can grow a plant and take that
plant and extract the flowers or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: you do, make an extract, that's not the
important part.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you can like bring a plant to life,
and, and harvest it and take that medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: and give it to somebody and it really
changes their life, there's nothing that
[SPEAKER_04]: feels better than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, it really is just a
completely satisfying altruistic thing to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that a lot of the research
scientists that work in at GW,
[SPEAKER_04]: they kind of feel the same way as the
growers up in California that are growing
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine for, for children with an
epilepsy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's really altruistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the community as a whole, not
everybody, but as a whole has this bias
[SPEAKER_04]: against big pharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they look at anything related to do
with big pharma as, oh, you're selling out
[SPEAKER_04]: or you're taking our plant and giving it
away, you know, to the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said earlier, to me,
these plant genetics are a human resource
[SPEAKER_04]: that should be accessible to everybody,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're with a big company or
you're a little guy, like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: matter, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the big guys should be
stealing from the little guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think having access to the tools is
kind of fair game across the board,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're certainly not going to keep wheat
seeds or corn seeds or potato seeds out of
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody's hands, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you want to work with a plant as a
human, I think that you've got the right
[SPEAKER_04]: to go and collect some seeds from wherever
you can find them and start working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I certainly agree with the
sentiment that there is a lot of like anti
[SPEAKER_01]: big pharma sentiment in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I can understand why in some
respects, you know, like the, the opioid
[SPEAKER_01]: crisis in America is an obvious thing you
could point out and be quite skeptical of
[SPEAKER_01]: their motives in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand what you mean where it's
like, I've met a lot of people who work in
[SPEAKER_01]: big pharma and a lot of them want the best
for their patients and they're not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it for financially driven reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I always love how people are like
super critical of big pharma, but no one
[SPEAKER_01]: ever has a problem with antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we, you know, it's,
you know, it's like, we just agree that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually being done for the good of
people, but like it does cost money to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're getting to the point though,
where we have this whole anti like anti
[SPEAKER_04]: vaccine movement now, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like there's, we used to take pride
in, in having knowledge and now there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: large segment of certain countries made
for my nameless that they really take
[SPEAKER_04]: pride in the ignorance.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, if you're, if you're an
educated person, person, they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're up in your ivory tower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not in contact with the regular,
the regular man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's gotten to the point where they
think that, you know, Bill, Bill Gates is
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to chip people.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's trying to like, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I saw a sign the other day
since it was a picture of Bill Gates or a,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd put his head on, on someone at a
gates and it said, um, you're not worth
[SPEAKER_04]: micro chipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Change my mind.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, why would you think that like
the guy has just given away like most of
[SPEAKER_04]: his wealth and somehow the conspiracy
folks in the world have turned around to
[SPEAKER_04]: go, no, he's actually just trying to use
it to get more money.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think if you have any
understanding of science and virology and
[SPEAKER_04]: vaccines that, you know, especially in a
COVID world, how you could be anti
[SPEAKER_04]: vaccine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you have it friends.
