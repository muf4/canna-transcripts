[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: A cannabis podcast for budding
enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have it folks, the second part
of the Bode interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, this episode was brought to us
by Organic Gardening Solutions,
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 Australia, and All Things Bode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're ready to jump back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this next one's a little bit of a
two-parter.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about the idea of certain
gear or cuts, so to speak, having kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: bad vibes associated with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an idea I've heard a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the most notable example would be,
you know, and I could be wrong here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think I'm pretty correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fairly confident that Indian guy's
specific instructions were that he didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want anyone to like kind of F to the G13
hash plan, but that seems to have kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I know that you broke it,
but you didn't F to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, we're not talking about you,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that like in that such
situation where someone has made it fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: clear their intentions and then some other
party has kind of done the opposite of
[SPEAKER_02]: that, do you feel there is such a thing as
kind of bad vibes associated with that
[SPEAKER_02]: gear or not necessarily?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a shame that that person's
intentions were respected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of a shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it applies in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think for NDN it's a special kind
of thing because he's kind of like a deep
[SPEAKER_00]: grandfather of a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's an old timer and he was a big
seed collector and he has a lot of amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and he's very altruistic and he's in
giving and he gives, he'll give,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the most rare seeds ever to like
some new guy that, you know, maybe that
[SPEAKER_00]: just started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's kind of like this unique Santa
Claus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for someone that does that,
I mean, I've heard him getting in trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: too of giving out stuff that he's not
supposed to, but for him, I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, with elders especially, I think we
should kind of respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his whole thing was he wanted that
strain to be kind of like, he wanted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted people to enjoy it and he wanted
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his big thing was, yeah, you can make
hybrids, but you can't, you can't F to it
[SPEAKER_00]: for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty sure you can give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I talked to him for a
while, but there does seem to be a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of strange cuts and it's mostly
people just kind of, I understand if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really rare and if people spend a
tremendous amount of time or it's enough
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's a family strain that goes back
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's where communication
comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, you know, if people are open and they
communicate about what they want to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: what things are, there doesn't need to be
bad blood or things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sad when a strain gets that kind
of energetic kind of gunk on it because it
[SPEAKER_00]: holds that, you know, just like every seed
is kind of a prayer that's just waiting to
[SPEAKER_00]: be popped open and through epigenetics,
it holds not only its history going back
[SPEAKER_00]: through time, but all the cultures that
utilized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a seed is this, I mean, people don't
realize how amazing it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this kind of dusky jewel that,
that, that transforms time into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, into a tangible way to interact
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost, yeah, it's, it's basically
like a bejeweled time machine that holds
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, these seeds and
clones and everything are very sacred and
[SPEAKER_00]: very special and they don't need to have
this thing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, there are instances
where, like I said, with families that
[SPEAKER_00]: hold that, but I don't know, it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it comes down to really the
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people have something that you want
to, that you want to keep to yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably shouldn't give it out because
things get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are human and it's like,
if you give it out, it's probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it from all different things,
all different viewpoints, but really it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down to communication, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there any cuts which you don't like
to work with from maybe say the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: the more modern elite clones, maybe not
necessarily due to what we were just
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, but maybe just in general,
you don't particularly like working with
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any, you know, kind of popular
modern elite clones that fall into that
[SPEAKER_02]: category for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I veer away from work of certain
breeders that I don't jive with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would step back to everybody,
but sometimes I won't usually breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from someone that I don't,
our lines are jive with so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for clones, you know, and I don't know
if there's a, if it's a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if it has a lot of drama around it,
I kind of stay away with it from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless, unless I know who it came from and
I can kind of communicate with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: like GG4, like, you know, I know that I
can communicate and I could offer up what
[SPEAKER_00]: I, what I want to do and they could
respect that and I could respect them and
[SPEAKER_00]: that could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, with Josie and people that
have special things, like if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: communication there, I think it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but there are a lot of clones that
just get out into the wild and people go
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and people get uptight and I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's another of those kind of
communication things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a strange thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish people would kind of stop chasing
these clones and really just start popping
[SPEAKER_00]: their seed collections, you know,
and also, you know, I see kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: new, interesting trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like before it would just be these,
these amazing clones that people would
[SPEAKER_00]: have that pop up like the cams and the OGs
and now, but now you're seeing people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have, that have kind of like a good vibe
and a good internet presence, like
[SPEAKER_00]: Capitulator or Stunt Master Flex who have
like the GMO cookies and Cap's got the Mac
[SPEAKER_00]: and just from their good vibes and them
hyping it on their, up their strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: they really liked that they've created,
they've kind of created their own elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, so not, we're not just
finding anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of creating them and I think
that is going to show people that anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: can find these special elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, Hey, if people have a problem,
it's like, then you have your own special
[SPEAKER_00]: elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I think people should stop
chasing and start creating, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people, we have so much to uncover
that it's kind of, we don't want to just
[SPEAKER_00]: be chasing our tails anymore, even though
it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the strains are pretty cool these
days, but I think there's a lot more to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to really explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, how important do you
feel it is that new seeds are constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: being popped?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for example, in Australia,
I find people aren't, don't really pop
[SPEAKER_02]: that many seeds, so to speak, at least on
average.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to tell them in my opinion,
at least it seems like that's what drives
[SPEAKER_02]: the progression of the scene in a way,
you know, like the new things coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: that people can enjoy, you know,
how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And does that play into your philosophy of
making F1s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's almost a way of facilitating
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, in California, it's kind of
different as it is, it is a clone culture
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's kind of changing now,
especially with outdoor and people
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing that seeds are just so much more
vibrant and the root system is so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more amazing and they don't have all the
STDs that all the clones do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, California is a,
is a clone culture and it's a hype
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's driven by music, it's driven by
coolness, it's driven by, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if a strain maybe isn't the ultimate
strain, if you get rappers smoking and
[SPEAKER_00]: rapping about it, you know, Cookie's a
good example, Cookie's an amazing strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really cool, but there's a lot of
drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All around and there's a lot of people
saying, you know, this and that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes cool hybrids, it's neat,
but it's people are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: things are people just, people will latch
onto something and just take it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just hammer it to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and it's like kind of sad for
the strain itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I would love to see people
popping seeds and I think it's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: more and I think people are getting more
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just worry about the future and the way
things are going, you know, maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually as she can, as big as really
cheaper and there's lots of brands and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's lots of people pumping it out that
people won't really have the impetus to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people just do it ornamentally or
just for craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think that, yeah,
everything comes from a seed and it,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our best stuff is always,
it's just where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's its origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going to find it and
that's where we should be looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we kind of tap into the mindset of
the people who are kind of promoting that,
[SPEAKER_02]: clone community, at least subconsciously,
a lot of what I hear from these types of
[SPEAKER_02]: folk is that, you know, the elite clones
are just so far superior to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: most things you'd get out of seeds that
it's almost not worth bothering with
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that in mind, do you find there's a
big variation between the elites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you find that there are some cuts
that are definitely considered elite?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're just phenomenal in every
way, but then there are others which are
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe considered elite by the masses,
but they just really kind of don't stand
[SPEAKER_02]: up compared to the other one, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think too, there's also sometimes
in the clone world, you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm sure that, you know,
there's at least two Blue Dream clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really good Blue Dream clone
that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Blue Dream is awesome,
but Blue Dream gets a lot of flak and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's because people grow the really
bland, quicker, more indica version of
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's clones that are elites
because they have a history.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've performed for, you know,
10, 20 years and they have a really
[SPEAKER_00]: special uniqueness to them and they always
kind of hit home just where you want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of the,
especially in the new hyper turpy kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it kind of a pop art breeding,
kind of like a derivative breeding where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, people are, everybody's kind of,
everything's derivative of itself and
[SPEAKER_00]: people are smashing everything together
and it's kind of like the Andy Warhol
[SPEAKER_00]: style of breeding where it's very neon,
it's very flashy, it's bright,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really hitting all the boxes with
flavor and smell and it's more for the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, like recreational kind of dab
culture that loves the more, they love the
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyment of the flavors and the taste
more than maybe so the effects or the
[SPEAKER_00]: origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's kind of comes down
to it is like, if an elite's been an elite
[SPEAKER_00]: for more than five years, I think it,
you know, like, oh gee, no one's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: dispute that that's not an awesome plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim is, no one's gonna dispute that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's new stuff that comes online
and people chase every day that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's hard for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to, I find it fascinating and I
love to try all these new things and I try
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep abreast, you know, like all the
new stuff like the purple punches and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday drivers and the orange trees and
the lemons this and the, I love checking
[SPEAKER_00]: all those out and I love seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, a lot of times those don't
last more than a year or two, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and same with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies is a great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's held itself up and, you know,
people love it and it's probably lasted
[SPEAKER_00]: the test of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of derivative kind of
one-offs that pop in and out, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles, they pop on the surface,
people get really into it and when enough
[SPEAKER_00]: people try it, they're kind of like,
hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's more of elites is what
passes the test of time, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you ever have any intentions of
ever delving back into some of the really
[SPEAKER_02]: old school stock like, you know,
SSSC, for example, we've got the temple,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, which is a good example of where
you've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever be interested in doing it
more?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not, is that because, you know,
the future excites you so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, I love vintage lines and that's
kind of my, one of my things for
[SPEAKER_00]: Supernatural Selections is like,
I really get to get deeper into those and
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a lot of stuff going on
right now that, you know, some of my old
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I've, you know, like Beatrice Trois
and NL2 and, you know, like all these
[SPEAKER_00]: really unique old vintage ones I have,
you know, from older seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a really nice friend who was
instrumental in some of the early Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: work and Sensi work and he sends me some
really cool stuff and I love getting stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: from him and sometimes it's total junk and
it turns out funny but I just love seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: it because it's like a snapshot to a
bygone era, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you really get to see and it's
neat to see what people remember and then
[SPEAKER_00]: what really the reality is, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, over time people have
granularized their memories and they
[SPEAKER_00]: change and but I love vintage stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite things to pop and
then whenever I can I do, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have a quite a good collection of
vintage seeds but I can only do so much
[SPEAKER_00]: and since I do kind of have to work on a
couple different levels, I kind of have to
[SPEAKER_00]: partition myself so let's say like 50%
goes to Bodhi seeds and then 10% goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: vintage and 10, 15% goes to Norica and now
I think maybe like 30% will go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Supernatural Selections so I just,
I have to find that kind of pie chart that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes everything move forward so I can pay
the rent and also explore everything I can
[SPEAKER_00]: and also, you know, follow my own passion
and also create things so people can
[SPEAKER_00]: follow their own passion but yeah,
I would love to see more vintage stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: come out and I really get excited and I
love all the stuff that Mean Gene pulls
[SPEAKER_00]: out of his hat while he has a lot of cool
vintage stuff and yeah, people are just
[SPEAKER_00]: popping out of the woodwork with all these
unique lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, whoa, that still exists,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, someone has that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, speaking on one
specifically, Talk of Kabul has always
[SPEAKER_02]: been one that's been quite interesting to
me and I think it's probably because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the elusivity of it, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that strain like and do you have
a plan to use it again or have you maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: lost it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like Talk of Kabul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like all those rough old Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little, you know, it depends on
what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Talk of Kabul was unique in that,
you know, it's from Mark's castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark is like, he's an amazing old
character guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he kind of hyped it up a little
bit because I don't totally agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: what he said about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I didn't grow it to its full
potential or even outdoors but to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a really nice commercial like modern
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's kind of that bland but dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the raw power of Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got good strength but as a breeding
plant, it's kind of bland and kind of blah
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way but for where it is, you know,
I'm not growing it in the arid high desert
[SPEAKER_00]: of Afghanistan and I'm not really making,
I'm sure making hash with it is phenomenal
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's kind of what I used it in is in
one of my deep line alchemy crosses which
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of focusing on the kind of like
traditional plants that were used for hash
[SPEAKER_00]: making and kind of hybridizing those with
the G13 hash plant or other Indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also, he also had another one called
Warlord that came from the same thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole deal with that was, I guess
there was a, what was it, like 2002 or 96,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was way back when somewhere the Special
Forces went in and raided a Warlord and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was growing a lot of really amazing
cannabis for hash and it was the Big Talk
[SPEAKER_00]: in Kabul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loved that hash and the Special
Forces went in and raided it and someone
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbed the seeds and brought them back
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was one of those cool, kind of like
all those old really cool Afghanis have
[SPEAKER_00]: that backstory, kind of like alien
technology has its backstory and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone, I like those old kind of things
and this actually, if we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy old Afghani style stuff,
Stray Fox got some seeds from,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was from his brother who served
over in Iraq in Ranya and those seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is like a dead ringer for like if
you could take pure Kush and Kush cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them together like this spicy,
bready, like Persian bakery smell and like
[SPEAKER_00]: this really beautiful, heady body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it reminds me kind of like the
Hollywood pure Kush, the one or the LA
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Kush, not the OG like one,
but the more like feminine, cushy kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: baby power-esque one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's some amazing, yeah,
kind of like the LA Pure, but kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: on the kind of the Bubba realm,
but with, but yeah, there's, some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: old Afghanis are amazing and that's kind
of what I'm excited this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a lot of really old,
weird Afghanis outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing like my artifact one,
which is kind of like the Afghani that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody remembers, but no one's been
able to procure like that super accurate,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost roadkill, like cabbagey,
kind of like a deep chunky, but not as
[SPEAKER_00]: bland as deep chunk, kind of this really
raw kind of like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it smells like a prison basketball game or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I just like exploring
all the, the weirdest things, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the talk of Kabul, cool line, cool
breeder, but on its own, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because you just touched
on about four or five questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we'll get to soon enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: First question though, I'm a huge deep
chunk fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a huge Tom Hill fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all of his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we even mentioned about this at
the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never found a deep chunk,
which I was satisfied with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like how you described the talk
of Kabul.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always a bit lackluster in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you found the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, I've found good use for it
as a breeding tool because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still a lot of desirable
characteristics around it, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: have you ever found a female where you
were like, damn, you know, this has got a
[SPEAKER_02]: good taste as well as all those other deep
chunk traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a long time ago, I found one
deep chunk and I was like, I call it like
[SPEAKER_00]: the sativa phenol or something,
but which it's not, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just a little bit more stretchy and
a little bit more flavorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of a, it seemed like a
throwback.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, other than that, they all,
they're so inbred and they're so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, that plant is like full
on dinosaur Jurassic park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it must've been inbred through some
families in Afghanistan for hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is like basically it's also the
ultimate like fun learning Afghani to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my first Afghani that I really got
into and kind of bred with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even I did some of my early lines,
I were deep chunk crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns everything into deep chunk,
which is amazing, but you get to slight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it is like terminator of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a really cool effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, my sister really loves deep chunk,
like just makes her laugh and it makes her
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really, it has that classic,
just take you home, huggy kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it doesn't always behave indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, all of Tom's stuff is more
for outdoors anyways, and that's where it
[SPEAKER_00]: was bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But deep chunk, you know, it's like,
if we were teaching a course, like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the textbook Afghani, like you can't get
any more like textbook Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, that's kind of like,
if you ever saw that picture of Richard
[SPEAKER_00]: Evans Schultes and wherever he was in
Afghanistan, he's standing by those really
[SPEAKER_00]: squat old plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was in the forties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it looks, it basically looks like
deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think deep chunk is pretty cool,
even though I don't really enjoy breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with it because it just turns everything
into deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have found that myself a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found one male where kind of isn't so
dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it turns everything phenotypically
into deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found this one male where a lot of
the mothers kind of the high and the taste
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to shine through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm enjoying playing with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, Jesus, that flavor has got some
serious issues with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on another little interesting side
note, I found a female that had just this
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear it must have had a really
significant percentage CBD in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I called it the face melter because it
was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like having like a warm
water poured over your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a massage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I missed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, like a body massage,
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, just dipping back on a thing
you mentioned a few questions ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think there is, you know,
a certain amount of romanticism around
[SPEAKER_02]: strains from years gone by?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the typical ones being,
you know, haze, tie, roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've never experienced the
roadkill skunk myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm still a bit on the fence,
especially because a lot of the people who
[SPEAKER_02]: I really trust their opinions,
they speak so highly of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I hear stories about,
you know, people will say like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you know, you'd smell it in a guy's
pocket before he'd even walked in the
[SPEAKER_02]: house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, is that really true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I've never had anything close to
that happen to me with modern cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it really that strong?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there was a lot of
really special old strains back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, what they always
say is like, if you remember the 60s,
[SPEAKER_00]: you weren't there kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of there's a lot of
old stoners that have a lot of fond
[SPEAKER_00]: memories of their youth and they kind of
believe in things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was some strains that really
stood out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially, I think a lot of the
import from these point of origin places
[SPEAKER_00]: where they had all the terroir and they
had all that and they brought it through,
[SPEAKER_00]: those things would really they would
really ring some bells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the roadkill skunk thing,
I mean, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I've been kind of
playing with for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've done so many different hybrids
and so many outcrosses and I can get like
[SPEAKER_00]: it get almost right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it won't cure out skunky or,
you know, or it'll be too pissy or it
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be strong enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that with the roadkill
skunk, yeah, I think it was probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: really hideous old Afghani, one of those
Afghanis that was bred forever to be
[SPEAKER_00]: super, super strong for their hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it really kicked people's ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it also got people busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that that terpene,
I think it must have some kind of lower
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular weight or something,
because I think it vaporizes pretty quick
[SPEAKER_00]: because outside it'll smell for blocks
like people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of course, people are going to
get busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the whole neighborhood smells like a
dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the line for two weeks,
it'll smell like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But week three, all of a sudden,
the terpenes vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they something or it changes and it
doesn't it doesn't hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, you know, people reminisce about
that light green golf ball super kill you
[SPEAKER_00]: a smell through your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those strains do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm hoping to have something
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm not on a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just more of a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's difficult, you know,
but cannabis puts out every imaginable
[SPEAKER_00]: smell you can think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow you can get it to create that from
onions to passionflower to like fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there and you can bring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's just I think really it's
a combination of maybe some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian Afghani or maybe even like some
kind of really oil candy like motor oil
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of Afghani sativa mixed with a with a
kind of some kind of grueling,
[SPEAKER_00]: acrid, low, low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people, whether they create it
or someone digs it out of their trunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's still out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just it just was kind of
selected against in in the 80s and 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, mid 90s is when all the
fruity stuff came in, all the bubblegums
[SPEAKER_00]: and blueberries and all that funny,
gross stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of went by the wayside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wanted the kind of, you know,
all the the groovy, fruity, bubbly stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that even put the nail and coffin even
deeper for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your favorite flavor of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really like effects,
but if I had to have a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do like that really bright
lemon, pine, solid, OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the stuff you can taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if I had to really pin it
down, I like the really like deep roasted
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bubba spice kind of baked goods
and sweets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like the really feminine like
she must like the stuff that's just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of really engages your neurons,
like makes you like stuff that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sexy smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are like the I'm also trying to like,
you know, I make a lot of weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a lot of onion and I make a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like pirate sweat and a lot of I try to
make really weird smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like a garlic pickle like I'm
making all these really weird lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: no one I'm sure will ever want to smell or
smoke in this kind of roadkill projects
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I just like extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a Hawaiian that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like gardenias and it has a
really unique effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think spice spice is my favorite
spice and really bright fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what's the most medicinal strain
you've ever had for yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel that, you know,
the quote the most medicinal strain is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to vary from person to person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think that much like we do have
strains that, you know, broadly treat
[SPEAKER_02]: certain conditions, it's very likely that,
you know, maybe the strain you personally
[SPEAKER_02]: like the most I might as well,
because if it speaks to you, it possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: speaks to me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it comes down to,
you know, definitely certain strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: For certain things, but it comes down,
I think, to body chemistry and and and
[SPEAKER_00]: your own endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I thought I've even heard like I
was a Raphael Moshulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was saying that he even believes that
the endocannabinoid system is in part
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for our own personalities,
like how we are as humans and how we are
[SPEAKER_00]: as people, because our you know,
it's like a fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's endocannabinoid system is
slightly different in the way it interacts
[SPEAKER_00]: with itself and then interacts with
cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can almost lend to make us who we
are as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, you know, it's kind of
like those people, I know people that
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke like a super racy sativa and they go
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the people that smoke an
indica and they want to do like a
[SPEAKER_00]: triathlon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when it comes to CBD rich
stuff and stuff, you know, it's pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're pretty, you know,
what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know, I think it's really
comes down to personal chemistry and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding what really works for you,
you know, and also what find people really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there should be, I don't know why
there's not a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there is where people are logging
that have serious illnesses and
[SPEAKER_00]: degenerative illnesses, logging down what
strains work for them for certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: like lupus or MS or like really,
I would love to see a strain directory for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have honestly have things that
are going on and really be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: correlate those too.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some people it's, you know,
necessary just due to the sheer amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of cannabinoids they need to ingest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think the idea of making
concentrates, I guess specifically in the
[SPEAKER_02]: context of say dabs or, you know,
those types of solventless or solvent
[SPEAKER_02]: extractions, which are going to be ideally
theoretically used through like a dab rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not talking about like,
you know, RSO caps or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that you, while maybe some
people gain a certain sense of medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: value out of it, you're also losing a
certain amount of ability to use the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: in a spiritual way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the way, the reason why I say
this is because I'm not an overly
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual person, but I mean, there's
certainly times when I've had cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: felt those types of effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I've never had such an experience
with dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Admittedly I'm not a huge dabber,
but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel it's the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're almost losing your link to the
plant in a way when you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I used to, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always like getting reeducated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I used to kind of look down on
concentrates and dab like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just like a bunch of crackheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, it's like plant of
the apes, but monkeys always trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: push it further, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, and then I saw people
like in Colorado as it started to catch on
[SPEAKER_00]: and people like Green Dot and all these
people like really like honing their art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was realized, oh my God,
this is like, this is people basically
[SPEAKER_00]: doing an alchemical process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like a modern cannabis
alchemy of taking the vital essence and
[SPEAKER_00]: spirits and terpenes and volatiles and
concentrating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's, you know, for people
that have serious illness, a dab is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the only thing that's going to
really get enough active constituents into
[SPEAKER_00]: their system to really find the relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find, I don't know, I find the whole
dab culture like fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how it goes hand in hand with glass
and art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really unique like genre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it baffles me, you know, I don't do
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably like explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm so hypersensitive, I think I
would just lose it on a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I smoke hash here and there
and that's pretty good, but maybe I should
[SPEAKER_00]: try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it's really for my
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for people that enjoy it and people
that have, you know, maybe smoke so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's the next logical step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that people are being creative and
at least if they have to go that far to
[SPEAKER_00]: really make it unique and special and
really push each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like how people are always
trying to come up with the most terpy and
[SPEAKER_00]: most this and most that and try and
capture all the volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also, you know, I like, I don't
know, I think it's just, it's a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: thing unto itself and I don't judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like how passionate people
are about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, personally, I don't think it's
kind of the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the majority of people and I think it
probably people that don't understand it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of look down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the people, some of the people I
respect the most love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is so cool and I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a cool thing, but not my thing,
but it is unique and it does have medical
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even the recreational applications,
even though they can seem excessive and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, you know, I've seen people at
the cups take a dab and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fall backwards, land on their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I think it comes down to being
responsible and people having the
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence to utilize these really
potent cannabis concentrations in amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, you could probably
have a pretty, I think it would be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bungee jump into the void.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could probably have a kind of
a spiritual experience with a dab if you,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you're like, I don't know enough
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the effects, I've never taken a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a dork for saying that,
but I just know what would happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've never done a little sneaky red hot
knife in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody makes fun of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, we're taking a dab
and everyone's trying to give me a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, it's usually at a
cup or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like the last place I would
ever want down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a mass TD while you're at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have given me amazing concentrates
and people do incredible jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love how, you know, and,
you know, the highest grade bam,
[SPEAKER_00]: he lives, he's in the area and he gives me
his pen sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are so flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so fun and they're so awesome and
they have a good spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken them traveling and that's,
you know, that's kind of about as far as I
[SPEAKER_00]: go with concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a little hash, but yeah,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would have just a dab,
but I would need to be in a meditative
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would need to be in my dome,
like ready there, getting there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Lotus position and ready to just shoot
into the void.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's way too much cannabinoids for
my system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost a boring DMT for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a cannabis DMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gung ho, I honor all the people that
can do dabs with intelligence and passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like space commandos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're passionate and you do a good job
and you make a quality product,
[SPEAKER_00]: then more power to you and more power to
everybody that's into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the glass artists and all the
festivals like Chalice, that's like a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: How crazy is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this, yeah, cannabis and the whole,
community constantly blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just try and, I try and not judge and
just sit back and enjoy the ride that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it sure is wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certainly used to be a lot more
anti-dabs than I am now, but I think the
[SPEAKER_02]: thing which I see about it, which I think
is going to be really hard to make it not
[SPEAKER_02]: problematic is I, you know, the visual act
of watching someone take a dab is quite
[SPEAKER_02]: akin to some other harder drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's always going to be a hilt over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come, but the other thing is I find a lot
of people just blow their tolerance out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the water and then they really struggle to
enjoy flowers afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's something you got to be
super mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, it's like that with,
at that point it'd be kind of comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it really can becomes a drug
because yeah, you're, you're pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself so far and bludgeoning your
cannabinoid system so hard that yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're creating a pretty, uh, pretty
intense tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well to get onto something maybe a
little more lighthearted, um, what was the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest disappointment you've ever had in
regards to popping seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And was it popping some land raised seeds
that you had high hopes for and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: turned out to be duds or was it in fact a
line you made and likewise, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: turned out to be a dud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I've made some deadlines for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some, yeah, I wonder what's the
worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to kind of remember, I used to kind
of, I had some lines from other,
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to pop a lot more seeds from other
people, like some of the big companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been let down a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to like, I don't want to say
any names or anything, but there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: while where it seemed like people weren't
putting out that quality of stuff or
[SPEAKER_00]: people were just pushing stuff out too
fast or, you know, or I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but something that's disappointed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I, I try and respect every
plant I take into my lungs, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll even weird stuff like my
philosophy is usually it's the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: lurking bud that has the best effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's usually the scraggly piece
of weird thing that barely, and I always
[SPEAKER_00]: find it funny because on Instagram I'll
post some of the sativa pictures and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be like, learn how to grow or what
is that swag or what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like people and like,
they don't get like, this is like such a,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a rare, like special Rajasthani plant
that I got from a Baba who's like had it
[SPEAKER_00]: in his like Sangha crew of sadhus for like
eons and that's their special string.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't really realize that like
some of these things that look funny,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they are, they have the most amazing
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, these days I try,
I give everything a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my most, I guess, disappointments
would be smoking something that someone
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me that, that obviously was,
wasn't grown correctly or had,
[SPEAKER_00]: had lots of problems or really gross stuff
on it or, or grown with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's just, it's,
I think it's the, my most sad time is when
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't respect the plant and still
produce the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have you ever had any seeds confiscated
on the way back or maybe the alternative
[SPEAKER_02]: question is, do you send seeds back by
mail or you take it a little more L risky?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do it always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have been busted at,
at the airport and it was kind of funny
[SPEAKER_00]: and synchronous thing stuff, but it scared
the hell out of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife was waiting outside with our
kids, like for hours while they had me in
[SPEAKER_00]: the like strip search room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my, one of my Nepali Himalayan
kind of like when I was collecting seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: there, they had collected like 15 lines
and I had them all marked and I had them
[SPEAKER_00]: all in bags and I couldn't find this one
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, I hit them
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't figure out where the hell I
put it and didn't know where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I have secret ways of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, of course they pull me into
the secondary and they're digging through
[SPEAKER_00]: all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in my toiletries, they find this
bag of seeds and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, it's a snack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, it looks like a,
you know, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, it's probably it's hemp
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat those in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, and they're like,
so they call the guy over, brings a little
[SPEAKER_00]: kit and they put a little season and they
shake it and it turns purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden it was like all hell
breaks loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy freaks out and grabs everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He locks down, he hits a button and
they're like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you know, and everybody's
scurrying, screaming like, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just, you see like, I guess it came
up positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first guy comes through and he's
like, stand there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you know, he starts going
through all my stuff and he goes through,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's going through, he's going through,
he almost gets to my stash of all my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that I brought over, you know,
and then the next higher up guy comes up
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's like, let me look through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he starts over and he does,
he does, he does, he almost gets there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the next guy comes up the
higher up and now they've, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've all these guys around me and they're
really freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally he is looking through
everything and he's just about to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the head honcho comes up and he's
like, did you search, did you search all
[SPEAKER_00]: those bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, they're like sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they put my bag down and
they sent me and they did the strip search
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of, you know, they were
saying they're going to send me to
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, you know, threatening me
and doing all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was pretty sad, but this
craziest thing is they never got to those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lost one pack, but I brought it back
like 15 and it scared the hell out of
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have more stealthy ways I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not going to say if I
bring them on my person or send them or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, just in case those special
humans that want to bust me are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have seeds on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do anything crazy like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just magically get back to America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's a very real danger and
people, you know, I say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say send them, get some of that
corrugated plastic they use for signs for
[SPEAKER_00]: when the local, like city council,
they put those signs up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually printed on this corrugated
plastic that make a great seed shipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just put that in an envelope and
send it back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually do two, send them from different
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you definitely get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I sent my seeds back from
Morocco, I sent them in two different post
[SPEAKER_00]: offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got one, but at least I got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I put the same seeds in each
one, knowing that one would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether there's a will, there's a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you just have to be
stealthy and tricky and just cover all
[SPEAKER_00]: your bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I have experienced that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, too, did the two packages and I lost
the seeds you gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm sure you can figure out a way to
magically get them somewhere near where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So follow up question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was maybe a bit of a hairy situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You found yourself in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about even worse in the other
countries?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's the hairiest moment
you've been in a foreign country?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a lot of like life threatening
things, but for like actual like getting
[SPEAKER_00]: busted kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just whatever you rank to be the most kind
of intense or, you know, scariest,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let me think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is probably the scariest is
when I was collecting seeds in Nepal
[SPEAKER_00]: during still during their civil war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Maoist against the,
you know, the ruling powers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was taking a bus to Pokhara and we
had a convoy because there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they still had a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would send a military convoy with
the bus and the convoy in front of us got
[SPEAKER_00]: blown up by the Maoists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they blew up the car in front of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about this maybe the craziest
thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I've always been in
dangerous situations, be it like you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost drowned once in this crazy boat in
Belize on the way over to Livingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think what else,
you know, even just being in Belize in in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early 90s was super sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco is not my favorite place.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really just the mountain people are
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems whenever I was in like towns,
I was always getting swindled or mugged or
[SPEAKER_00]: people just weren't, I don't know,
I'm not a big fan of Morocco, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, you know, maybe for actually busting
cannabis type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in China and I had my pen with me
and they sent me through the x-ray and it
[SPEAKER_00]: kept on popping up in the x-ray like
what's this metal thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh my God, if you know
China is like you're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's death sentence,
but you go to jail forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's all about the synchronicity
and the magic, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went pushed it through twice,
pushed it through twice and then it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason they couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally when it came through again,
I kind of like when they weren't looking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of pulled it out and they went
through it one more time and like it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't show up and like, oh, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sent me through, but I was like,
oh my God, what's gonna happen to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, you know, I'm like,
oh, it's like a e-cig or something and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, knowing in China, they don't want to
try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, okay, I have five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the effects to kick in to get all the
way across the airport and into my next
[SPEAKER_00]: plane by the time they figure out kind of
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But magically I made it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's always things,
but hopefully, you know, hopefully that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a thing in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want cannabis to be part of the
world again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was basically our most
utilized plant source from time immemorial
[SPEAKER_00]: was our very first cultivated plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been with us for hundreds of
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like our, it's so, it boggles my mind
that it's not part of our heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, we used, George
Washington used to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his favorite thing to sit on the
back porch and smoke some hemp and you
[SPEAKER_00]: were supposed to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they, it was a law as a farmer,
you had to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it really, it really boggles my
mind that we're in this predicament and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that we're coming out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the last section we've got,
oh, I shouldn't say last section,
[SPEAKER_02]: second last section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last section is just some really quick
answers, but second last section,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got all the questions submitted by
people who wanted to find out the inside
[SPEAKER_02]: scoop on mostly strains they're growing,
but let's start banging through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one, go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top five traits you look for in a good
male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uniqueness, resinous male, like if you
push it far enough flower, structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: really I think the uniqueness thing comes
into the like, is just cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness with cannabis and really getting
to know it so that you can kind of connect
[SPEAKER_00]: with your heart with it because you know,
plants have an electromagnetic field and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can, your heart is an
electromagnetic field and if you can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of do that, that's where you can kind of,
it's this sixth sense of kind of breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: where you just know something is special,
but definitely I think first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_00]: resinous males and structure and
stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, stem rubbing is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always encourage people to stem rub
before sex and after because the smells do
[SPEAKER_00]: change, you know, and also smell rub on
the collar, like up by the top and also
[SPEAKER_00]: down below, you get different smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're breeding for color,
that's pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just find the best structured,
best stable purple male if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: for purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, if you're doing for smell,
it's gonna be resinous males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Project wise, it's just testing your
females and your out-crosses and further
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really just kind of checking
all your bases, doing the best you can
[SPEAKER_00]: with your senses and then, you know,
that proves in the pudding the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you're doing a good job is grow
them out, see how it did, see what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing, that's a whole kind of strange
thing these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed back when I started if you
didn't test, you'd get run out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the norm now is nobody
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even a lot of the breeders that used
to be so super into testing have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gone by the wayside too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like people want things so
fast and so new that they're willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: just risk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like people that may be
testing before don't want to be left
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think testing is an important part
of not necessarily gifting, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna vent something, you want to make
sure that it's stable and it has all the
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable features that you originally
wanted to put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say people, you should test
your stuff more, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, a question which stands to
mind from that is I heard from a few
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders that maybe they weren't being
100% serious, but I get the inkling that
[SPEAKER_02]: they were when they say things like the
demand for certain, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors of the month or for new stock is
so high that they almost feel like they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have time to test all.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you said, they will get left behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there is room in the current
market for people to be able to test and
[SPEAKER_02]: stay relevant or do you think that the
time lapse between creating a strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: testing it, getting it to market is gonna
kind of start to be problematic in today's
[SPEAKER_02]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for new breeders, I think there's
like an impetus or a push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they just want to get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they don't have the time or they
don't have the back history or they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the things and they just want to get
their stuff out quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I mean, that's a short,
it's short-sighted and maybe you'll get,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe everybody will be super stoked and
hype up your strain and you'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you become a new breeder,
but it's not sustainable like then what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens when you're trying to do new
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I really think that it's
part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, another way to do
it is to is if you do find your niche,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to deal with the strain of
the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of creating your own new thing
and people appreciate that for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing is really find what you
think is gonna be the next big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I try and kind of imagine what's
gonna be big in the future and kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I try and play a lot of long
game, I kind of make stuff, I'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: about a year behind of my projects and
kind of think, okay, where is things
[SPEAKER_00]: going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are people into and what can I
bring to the table that might be unique
[SPEAKER_00]: and special, but also utilize what people
are really into and kind of go from there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a lot of my newer males are
more focused on turps and resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas some of the old ones like,
you know, Snow Lotus was more about
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing a sativa touch to everything and
bringing like a heartiness and Appalachia
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of bringing in the chem line in a
different way and really adding a special
[SPEAKER_00]: spice to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the G13 Hashplant was kind of to
allow, to turn things into a Hashplant,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a proper heavy duty, powerful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really, I think you can get
out of the whole mindset of trying to push
[SPEAKER_00]: things so fast, so out, so quick by just
tuning into yourself and really also
[SPEAKER_00]: looking into the future and also finding
your niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finding, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the Snow Lotus line,
possibly one of your more well known ones
[SPEAKER_02]: alongside the Sunshine Daydream and gosh,
forgetting the name of the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, Appalachia and then there's a G13
Hashplant and then there's some random
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, just the earlier strains we
mentioned, the ones that I thought were
[SPEAKER_02]: your two trademarks, Sunshine Daydream and
maybe it was Snow Lotus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, long story short, in terms of the
information you find online about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's an interesting one because it seems
like, you know, there's little tidbits of
[SPEAKER_02]: information here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing which kind of consistently comes
up is it says, you know, it's blockhead
[SPEAKER_02]: cross half gooey and there's no sweet
tooth traits present.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you tell us more about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what was it specifically
bringing to the table?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, it's obvious from looking
at the crosses, it was a good male,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's kind of hard to extrapolate what
traits it was bringing given the somewhat
[SPEAKER_02]: vague description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a wild one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a male, it was one of those ones that
kind of like just communicated to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just knew and like I saw it and you
know, it has this unique trait of having
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and it follows through in a lot of
its hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this really purple stalk thing that
goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It purples up its stalks and I don't know,
it literally, it was one of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a heart-breeding thing where
I just kind of connected with it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt it and I was like, oh, this thing is
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I out-crossed it to
like Bubba and a couple of things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know how things kind of come out with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and I noticed it was really
allowing all the best traits to come
[SPEAKER_00]: through of the parent-mother clone and
then beefing up like a lot of that potency
[SPEAKER_00]: and frost and the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was a really old,
the male was the really old blockhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was kind of mixed with our
kind of classic late 90s early 2000s Afgu
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of people grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's every town and city and
environment has these kind of like special
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that really kind of grew back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back then we had like S15 and Bunana
and Afgu and all these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Afgu was a really amazing like kind of
Hawaiian haze Afghani, but it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaned more to the Afghani and it had,
it didn't smell so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like a muted kind of
berry-ish, but the effect and the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: content was just like off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes, it makes a, I think it's
a really underrated plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes a great breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that P19 or product 19 or
whatever the blockhead, it had a little
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa and it had whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot exactly, but it was a,
well, it has, it doesn't, it's sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: tooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like P, product 19, P19,
it was from that crazy Yaqui or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of Breeder Steve's friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave him this crazy sativa and that was
the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it called it blockhead because it made
these really kooky flat tops and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong and virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that male didn't really have too much
sweet tooth going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it really kind of captured that kind
of really exotic and powerful and like
[SPEAKER_00]: virile sativa aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that combined with the Afgu just made
this really unique and special plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what surprised me with it was it was
so like clear in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it would just lightly put its own
kind of magic into crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would kind of just beef up whatever
cross but allowed a lot of the smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes in certain crosses
that were probably super multi poly
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids, it would, the snow lotus would
kind of pop through and you would get that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of muted kind of berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the, you know, in like the
Goji Oji, you get, you know, you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: berry of the snow lotus, but you get the,
you get that lemon pine solid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Oji, and it was kind of this perfect
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I tried many different Oji's
originally to try and before the Nepali to
[SPEAKER_00]: try and find one that really kind of had
that magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was just a really amazing
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I kept it for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I always used it because I
don't know, it just, it was, it just spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: to me and it just did such great stuff and
indoors and outdoors, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a, I'm not a big outdoor breeder,
but these days I've, I kind of am,
[SPEAKER_00]: but beginning it was all indoors,
you know, and, and it, it made amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really, I really respect and love
that plant a lot because for what it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made some hybrids with the super snow
lotus and the tranquil offentizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found snow lotus comes through great
in both of them and it's really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful one has in the snow lotus
female was such an amazing, beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you ever saw pictures of it grew
like a lotus, it like, it didn't grow like
[SPEAKER_00]: a normal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made these, like weird, strange,
beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a dark kind of like blackish
and it had a very like a head,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it like a heady indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it definitely grew like a sativa,
but it had that deep body, but with a
[SPEAKER_00]: really open vast mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some photos of that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really nice with kind of the,
uh, what's the word?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, almost like a little bit of fox
tailing going on that makes it look like
[SPEAKER_02]: the lotus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like an inflorescent,
like, yeah, almost like a hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a crab or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people have commented on how
nice that Cali orange male looks on your
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're ever going to see any more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I kind of, my Calio cut got
duded, which is sad, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: duded plants, you can still breathe with
them and it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the genetics are still things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to make a lot of different
hybrids with the Calio before I let it go
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of work with, I mean, like a
Wookie Calio and I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Calio-esque males that I'm kind of playing
with, but you know, the whole orange
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, it's difficult to get something
super just that epic orange flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: not, you know, a lot of things have that
kind of fake orange or they have that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a, a lot of them, most of the things
are like that skunky orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of, it's one of those on the
back burner that I play around with and I
[SPEAKER_00]: keep on mixing into other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a side project for my
own self and I'm slowly making like an
[SPEAKER_00]: orange tool out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm mixing it with different
things, you know, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: right now I'm trying to make a couple
different inbred tools, like a lemon tool
[SPEAKER_00]: and an orange tool just so I can hit it to
things and be like, oh, you want this with
[SPEAKER_00]: a little lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and same with the purple
unicorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it to a point now where I can take
turn things basically anything purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still, it still creates some great
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even now with the dragon's blood,
it's to a point where I can cross it to
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants and they're all going to have
that blood red sap come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a dominant trait now at about
F4, F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's passing that red sap trait onto
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's one thing about making
your tools is you can, you can do some
[SPEAKER_00]: cool stuff if you kind of just take time
and make stuff to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a plan to work with the Beaks
Holyweed again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't, I don't, the funny
thing is a lot of people ask, I get a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of emails and people ask for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I usually just give, you know,
if someone's really passionate about
[SPEAKER_00]: something and they really want it and they
can't find it, I'll usually dig through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have some seconds and I'll try and
find it and just give people out if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be projects and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really have those seeds left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just have the one mom and it's a
little bit dutted and my friend lives,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: His big thing is the Big Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, he does an amazing, phenomenal job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of just like you are,
you're crushing it on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just, I'm not even going to really
go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might maybe make some crosses with my,
my female that's left, but not in,
[SPEAKER_00]: no plans in the, in really in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I know there's packs out
there and I always encourage people to
[SPEAKER_00]: make more seeds from the packs,
especially the Norica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the people, I don't make a
lot of Norica packs because they're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a, it's a pain in the ass to make those
seeds because it's usually the super long
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got any packs of Norica,
please make more and give them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: To everybody, you know, I really encourage
people to, to make, to if you got rare
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, make more, especially if they're
mine, pass them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I, you know, especially if
they're deadlines, you guys, everybody can
[SPEAKER_00]: work them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no restrictions on my stuff,
on my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I be as creative as you want to please,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who are some of the upcoming breeders
who you kind of keeping an eye on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you kind of think they're doing
some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I don't, I only really get
to interact with some of the ones I know
[SPEAKER_00]: personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard for me to say, like,
I love seeing all the pictures and where
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going and, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a tough question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like some of my friends that I,
that I know that I've seen their stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: we trade stuff a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really get inspired by like Doc D and
Stray Fox and Snow High and Inspector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly the people that I kind of
interact with that on a, on like a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-internet level is, is, is what I get
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people like out and about,
you know, I, I love what some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of the land race guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love like what Charlie does like his,
he's like a super ancient grandpa of the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love, and I, you know, I like what
ACE does and even like, what's Nagpasi
[SPEAKER_00]: company that does all the cool Indian
jungly stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anyone, I like the people that are,
you know, I really like preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like people doing land race stuff,
like delicatessen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like people doing like really pushing
into different like extreme areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: like really pushing outside of the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people that I kind of really
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the whole extreme possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like people doing their niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for me it's people that are
pushing things in new directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, you know, and I don't
know who's, you know, who it's hard for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell what's, you know, like these days
it's like the fake news, what's hype and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until I really try something,
it's like, it's hard to say, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone that's passionate and that has a
niche and is following their heart and is
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and is humble and is really just
enjoying themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those are the people that are
like, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of vague, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next question is, have you had any
experience with the land race strain known
[SPEAKER_02]: as XAML or, you know, like the Reunion
Island land race strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've grown some myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed pretty cool, but more
importantly, I've heard from a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people online that they kind of consider
it to be the most trippy weed there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be interested to know, you know,
like what for you was the most trippy and
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've tried the XAML or, you know,
anything from Reunion Island, how did that
[SPEAKER_02]: compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I've always wanted to go
to Madagascar and then to Reunion to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someday, but you know, I think a lot of
the people that talk about that XAML as
[SPEAKER_00]: being like one of the most epic ones,
it was, you know, Garrett from,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was his, he did Warlock and did a,
what was his seed company?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's no longer with us, but he had a cut
of XAML that went around Europe and Spain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everybody just raved about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like the super psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried XAML and Crosses,
like in the ACE Crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I've never got to experience
a Piers Amal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that a friend, Xamelito,
it's one of his favorites and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: love, you know, I'm always growing out
weird, you know, crazy stuff to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for that kind of like ultimate
high that everybody talks about,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that super psychedelic high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I have experienced it
once in Guatemala and it was kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: was, I always call it the tomboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomb bud, but it was like,
I've never experienced anything like it
[SPEAKER_00]: since.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like, I don't know,
it came on like nitrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came on in this weird like harmonic hum
oscillating and like it basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: transformed the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost like, I don't know,
kind of like if you're familiar with like
[SPEAKER_00]: the family of like aero cycle hexamines,
it's a kind of a psychedelic family,
[SPEAKER_00]: like something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I don't know, but it came on like
nitrous and it was so soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a cartoon world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and my wife smoked it in Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, ever since then, I've been
like chasing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had hash in the Himalayas where
it just turned everything into the most
[SPEAKER_00]: ecstatic, joyful dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had flowers from this one baba in the
Annapurna range that I go visit all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time when I go back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it's the prairie set
over it or his chillum, but he had some
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty schwaggy looking flowers that just
took me to like another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a Oaxacan that was so psychedelic
and made me feel like I was like on the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of a mushroom or an ayahuasca kind of
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like it's always the point of
origin places that have those experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely have some psychedelic
strains, but nothing that just completely
[SPEAKER_00]: transforms reality like some of these
places that I've gotten at their point of
[SPEAKER_00]: origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I would love to try a good Xanamal
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for maybe a little more lighthearted
question, I'm so glad we got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is pineapple a legitimate pizza topping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, isn't there, there's like that
Hawaiian pizza everybody digs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you put whatever you want on your
pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pizza is like your own kind
of like mandala of vegetables and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be as creative and expressive of
you where you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see people get even more
creative with pizza, like with crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Szechuan peppers and neat spices and
maybe like fruits that don't have a long
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf life, like mulberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, anytime people get
creative, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think pineapple, maybe people
could up their game and even do something
[SPEAKER_00]: more crazy than pineapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sure, pineapple's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cuts the, it takes the edge off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, talking about pushing it to the next
level, what is your future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Future projects in the pipeline,
not necessarily related to pizza,
[SPEAKER_02]: but specifically in regards to males,
you know, what's, what's on the horizon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm pretty excited about this new
Afghani male that I'm working with because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's so, so what I've been,
you know, I've grown out a million zillion
[SPEAKER_00]: different Afghanis from modern to vintage
different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've, you know, I get close,
but I've never got that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I don't even know how to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like so accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like gamey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like roadkill, but it's just like
this whole other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these Artifact One, these old vintage
Afghanis that I'm finally popping,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so excited and it's so gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me so happy because it's
another kind of like a, it's another
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzle piece in the whole RKS thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if I, you know, have that one
RKS line, I've been working forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if maybe, maybe these two
meet, I think we might have it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe I have some other, I have some
sativas that are kind of gross that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think if they, if they might meet,
I think we might just have it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just all in all it, it just has a
different, it's such a different smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I always say if it smells
different, it's going to have a different
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have a good effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, I've tried
preliminary samples and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, let's see what else, doing a lot of
the dragon's blood work to see if I can
[SPEAKER_00]: turn everything in my stable, with red
blood as a marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I can make OGs that, you know,
that when, you know, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: identifiable, like, oh, this one bleeds
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be this, you know, it's a great
genetic marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some old Williams wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm popping again to see if I can make
temple again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiger's milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a lot from an old timer friend,
all his weird old stuff, some lemon and
[SPEAKER_00]: some orangey stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see what else I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dirty hippie line work and what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a backyard full of all kinds of
wacky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm most excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I got, oh, I got a lot of cool
sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got this, you know, some Charlie
stuff I'm trying and I've got some old
[SPEAKER_00]: herbaria Bushman that I revived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm doing a ton of my Himalayan
stuff for Norica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make more watermelon hash
plant and then some of the other lines I
[SPEAKER_00]: never released from those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just going for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just anything, you know, every year it's
so fun because I just go to, I have a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: seed collection and I have a big seed
fridge and I just go, what this year do I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to just go with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's so much I can only
do like this fraction of it, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why I encourage people to get a big seed
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really, I mean, it's so fun because
you can just, you can just follow your
[SPEAKER_00]: bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, every seed is an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every seed is like opening a book,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the main stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dorking out on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The A1 Afghani, is that the same as
Afghani number one or a different thing
[SPEAKER_02]: altogether?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just kind of renamed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a kind of an offline old friend that
owed me a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gave me some really rare seeds and
it just said roadkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an old vintage line from
NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I thought maybe it would be a
roadkill skunk or something, but it just
[SPEAKER_00]: turned out to be a really like vintage,
old, super gross Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of calling it roadkill,
because it's not because people get so
[SPEAKER_00]: uptight these days if it's not exactly how
they remember, it's not roadkill kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just called it artifact A1 or Afghani
one, like artifact one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's that true acrid artifact that no
one's really coming up with, but I know
[SPEAKER_00]: existed.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so another question we got,
I don't know if it was a typo or whether
[SPEAKER_02]: it was correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just read it as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you tell us about the A35 clone
that was used in the deep line alchemy
[SPEAKER_02]: number three?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our viewers has sent in the
question saying that specifically if you
[SPEAKER_02]: could tell us a little bit about your
thoughts on the line and if you would
[SPEAKER_02]: expect some good males to come from it,
because he was considering breeding with
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but he wasn't sure if it was the right
type of line to breed with and just wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to know your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of those, the deep line
alchemy are more for hash making and
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional hash making, but I think they
would make great combos with other lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially because they're hybrids,
they're usually pretty inbred plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by making a hybrid, it breaks their
dominance on future hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A35 was a gift from a really awesome
guy named Black Bart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were an old 35 year old Afghani
that he's had for a while and he said they
[SPEAKER_00]: had some pretty skunky phenos and there's
a lot of neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew them out, I grew out quite a bit
and the line was really cool and I found
[SPEAKER_00]: one that was just like really just like it
looked like just someone had bred it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time over in Central Asia just for
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super resonant, super dark,
super virile and it had, the smells are
[SPEAKER_00]: really kind of muted, but when you make
concentrates or hash or water hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really come out like they'll,
you get like licorice, like you get these
[SPEAKER_00]: really complex kind of oily, earthy smells
that you don't smell so much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but that makes amazing
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the A35 has a really great effect and
it's a great plant and it has this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: unique licorice scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'll be using it in the
future, but for that purpose, it seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: like a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so likewise, we've seen some photos
of, I don't know if it's the name of the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain or just what you kind of dubbed it,
the Ethiopian paintbrush, as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual strain Ethiopian hash plant or the
watermelon hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of these sound beyond exotic,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little more about them
and if there's any chance we'll see them
[SPEAKER_02]: publicly available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now the, well, the Ethiopian
was a gift from a friend whose family
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from that area and the plants that
came out were really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it definitely, you could tell it was
kind of like an heirloom or land race from
[SPEAKER_00]: that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sativa, but they were,
they had kind of same, some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could tell they might've been
worked kind of like in how South Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have some of their sativas they've
worked down so that they're relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: quick flowering kind of like the chiskey,
and the Durban, some of the Durbans that
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: These Ethiopians were relatively quick,
but they had a really amazing terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures and they had a really joyful
kind of meditative focused buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two ones that I kept were the
Ethiopian banana one, which smells kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just like bananas, which I thought was
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Ethiopian paintbrush smelled
just like kind of like paint thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was another little guy too
and called this Ethiopian spider and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just was the weirdest plant ever had the
thinnest leaves and it would like weave
[SPEAKER_00]: its way through plants, like to get to the
light, almost like kind of like a creeping
[SPEAKER_00]: vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Ethiopian banana, I kind of
started using it with a wookie and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing out those banana kind of music
for banana turps and to add a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an exotic hit to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the paintbrush is a little more
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of that kind of classic kind of
mindful sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are kind of just ones that I
personally enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've kind of been slowly working with
them and I've given out the banana to a
[SPEAKER_00]: few friends and they're playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a neat, it's a neat
Ethiopian line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always find the greatest land,
land races are hit or miss and usually
[SPEAKER_00]: need to go through quite a few to find
unique things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once in a while you get in these lines
where they, I don't know if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: heirlooms or what, or you're just lucky,
but you get a lot of really cool stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: just a small spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always kind of enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the watermelon hash plant was
just kind of my first, I guess it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi Seeds release, but it was kind of
technically kind of like Nerica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of my early hash plants I
collected in the Annapurna range of Nepal
[SPEAKER_00]: that was just this beautiful fox-hailing
giant, like relatively quick for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Himalayas, hash plant that smelled just
like fresh watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I let those out, I think maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been forever, maybe even like 10
years ago, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people have used those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they got used in the Otto.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a famous kind of CBD line in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe the watermelon hash plant
was used in the making of Otto,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a CBD line from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of other people have really
enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, no one ever really
made any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen anybody give them out or
make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year I decided to make some more
and they're kind of going now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people get to kind of experience the
watermelon hash plant hopefully again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good breeder and it really kind of
gives you the taste of the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what land race variety has left the
most lasting impression on you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe another way to phrase it,
what's been the most unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: For smoking, I really love the Himalayan
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it doesn't make good flowers,
but it makes the most amazing hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: For land races, there's something about
that area and the culture and the
[SPEAKER_00]: religious use and the people and the
trails and how old it is and all the lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and how all the valleys have different
microclimates and different variations on
[SPEAKER_00]: the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And families have different things and
some to feed the cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some they use for veterinarians,
some they use for chutneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some the babas use to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's such an amazing and vast spectrum
of cannabis in the Himalayan valleys and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cultures that utilize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could just beam myself to heaven,
it would be smoking a big chillum of
[SPEAKER_00]: Himalayan hash and just trekking into the
mountains and just smiling at all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people we walk by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just tell everybody and their grandma,
if there's one thing you're going to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're depressed, if your life sucks,
do whatever you can, trim, work at
[SPEAKER_00]: McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make enough money and just go
trekking in the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life will become clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll really nourish your heart and soul,
especially in Nepal right now because
[SPEAKER_00]: after the earthquake, they're having a
pretty hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the valleys I used to
really love, I've been completely wiped
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say, so I mean,
I guess to get to the Himalayas,
[SPEAKER_00]: although I do, that Guatemalan tomb bud,
though, that is still number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the Oaxacans that I've tried
are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco are not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: China, Laos, pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, wherever I've been all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Himalayas and the Guatemalan
tomb bud and some true Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any plans for any new Ortega lions to
be released?
[SPEAKER_00]: From Jim or from the seed line Ortega?
[SPEAKER_00]: From the seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I made the zombie dong with the
Ortega cut and I don't have the Ortega cut
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, but I do have, I made some seeds,
like some F2s and I do have some zombie
[SPEAKER_00]: dong seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could do some Fgen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were pretty creepy and these giant,
they were like these are giant long donkey
[SPEAKER_00]: phallus buds that smelled kind of like
onions and walking dead kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people like that and it would
knock people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great for sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe some zombie dong, but other than
that, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might give out some Snow Lotus Ortega
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, that's about it on the
Ortega.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, do you have any lines that you've made
for yourself, specifically for yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can never envision giving out to
the public?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure there's a lot of lines which,
you know, just sitting in the fridge,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, but do you have any where you
are like, I'm making this and I'm never
[SPEAKER_02]: going to give it out to the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, you know, that would be sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in a selfish way, but you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where maybe you were thinking like,
no, I need it for future projects or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'll sit on things,
but there's never a point where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's never getting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple like clone-onlys that I
haven't even given to like friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm sure if they asked, I'd be like,
oh yeah, try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I'm going to,
some of my like personal favorites that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't ever let out, I might let out maybe,
you know, there's a couple plants like my
[SPEAKER_00]: Stevie Wonder I've never given to anyone
because it's one of my earliest crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's such an awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to see it get kind of just
taken apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but you know, I have a couple of
special things that I want to give out
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have the Axis, which is a really
awesome plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Congolese hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have this one called Lush that I
really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pure Kush Lao that I think needs
to eventually get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I try and just, I have so
many seeds in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I try and just, whenever I can get
them out, like, so I do a lot of freebies
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's nothing really that,
you know, things, the only things that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't coming out to the public are things
that I think are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe still have latent
hermaphroditic tendencies or things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't, things that are more that I
wouldn't want that impact people in a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative way are kind of like what I hold
back or crosses that I think are too
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous or even, you know, there's some
testers I won't even send out to testers
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't, I just do it myself
because I don't, I don't trust the cross
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to want to even have people put
their time and energy into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think everything will come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's nothing that I'm going
to hold on for dear life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you have any advice for people
on how to best Fino hunt?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what the viewer was looking for
was maybe things like, is there like a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain size pot you like to use where
it's kind of small enough that you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of plants in, but big enough to get
a good representation of the plant or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just in general, what are your
kind of tips for Fino hunting?
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, if I'm trying to run through a
lot, I, I put, um, I don't know what size
[SPEAKER_00]: those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's pretty tall square pots
and they fit eight to a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a quarter gallon or a half gallon or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pretty much keep them healthy is,
and you gotta throw them right in right
[SPEAKER_00]: when they sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that works really good and you can
kind of just stack those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I do a lot of the outdoor to
indoor work, I usually use a three
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wait till they sex and as soon as they
sex, I'll clone them and run them inside
[SPEAKER_00]: and see, uh, how they do inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, but you can, I mean,
you, I know people that do kooky stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, do 1212 from seed and,
and run them in like these micro pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, you know, I, people do amazing
things with a, with a, not a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen like insane open
pollinations and people's like showers
[SPEAKER_00]: where they just like, run things,
you know, 1212, um, even sativa's 1212
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed, like in these tiny little
things and just put like a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, Whoa, you know,
and then people will revedge those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say be creative, but for me,
I, I usually try and anything that fits
[SPEAKER_00]: about eight to a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those standard black trays.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another little off topic one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your favorite year of grateful
dead music?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say probably the times that I
would go, like, I know I'm not like the
[SPEAKER_00]: world's ultimate great fall dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just went more to get for the
parking lot culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, it was, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved seeing all the peep freed up
people and shake down street and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love getting my LSD and mushroom
supply for the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, I would say I,
I, I think the first, I, the first time I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever saw him as I took, I got,
my mom got me a bus pass so I could go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the record stores and I could go to the
libraries and look at weird books about
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in the beginning of high
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I took the bus one day to
the, from Huntington beach to long beach
[SPEAKER_00]: to the dead show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I was maybe like 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like just, it was pre touch of
gray when I think that's kind of when
[SPEAKER_00]: everything turned weird for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, uh, so I would say maybe like,
like 87 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I know all that everybody says,
Oh, those sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but so just the times they went,
you know, from maybe 89 to 94 or 87 to 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I mean, no way a big, I'm not,
you know, I've been to lots of shows,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't say I'm like super dead head
because there's so many people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: just boggling my mind with like,
you know, they're like, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the year where they went trying to
set some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or until fire on the mountains,
you know, like, and like their minds,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how my mind has music and strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the mind of like grateful dead
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the, the knowledge some people
have on it all is pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they can tell, tell the year and
the show just from listening to the audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thing about the Grateful Dead is I
personally more than music and anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: I honor them and I respect, and I give so
much thanks for them for being the
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling psychedelic dispersion mechanism
for, you know, for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they didn't exist, the world
America would be a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They toured and took, uh, you know,
like heart opening, mind opening
[SPEAKER_00]: substances all over the Americas,
not to mention all the seeds that went out
[SPEAKER_00]: and disseminated all over the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like this, this like a circus of
awakening that moved through time and
[SPEAKER_00]: space all through America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without them, I don't know what it
would be like today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give maximum props to the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for creating a community that
made the world different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I think, especially given chem dog
goes its origins to the car park scene,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, it's, uh, certainly needs to
have its homage paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably going to be the last
question from the viewers who's just
[SPEAKER_02]: managed to squeeze it in two minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long story short, he wants to know,
he's got a few questions in here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think the best one is, are you
working with any of the more old school
[SPEAKER_02]: clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example, the New York Hayes,
you know, just also known as the Uptown
[SPEAKER_02]: Piff, uh, Skelly Hash Plant, one of my
favorites, or the Shoreline?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't, see, I'm kind of
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, it's hard for me to get some of
these really unique clones these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just, uh, do it hand to hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't get to try some of the,
all the super neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of have to wait for it to get to
me, but I do have a lot of the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Skelly's in my area, but I don't,
I haven't been authorized yet to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that may be someday, but I have
smoked it and I do think it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome and rather like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I love that the Cuban Black Haze is a
unique plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with that some, I made that
Band-Aid Haze with that, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a, my version of a Piff Churchy plant
and people tend to really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Cuban Black Haze by itself is,
is a really strange plant because it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: so big and it takes, you know,
kind of takes kind of a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I call it like a tequila weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it has that, certain
Mexicans have that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the sloshy kind of like
psychedelic slosh, kind of like if you mix
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol and sativas, it's like this really
sloshy kind of tequila-y like wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: old buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shoreline, uh, I would love to
see a good shoreline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown a shoreline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only heard cool things about it,
how it's like almost like a road killy
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, you know, those, and there's the
dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much cool, neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, and that's, I love,
like I grow crazy weird every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love to grow as many possible
clones that people give me cause I just
[SPEAKER_00]: love to check it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I get to see it, it just,
you know, I go into my room, I get so
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to see what plants are doing and
especially these clones and what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what's the hype of the day or
what's the old hype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's so satisfying to kind of see and
experience these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I tell people about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's no other pursuit on
earth besides maybe being a chef where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can be so creative and so there's so much
uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then when it's all said and done,
you get to inhale it and it becomes alive
[SPEAKER_00]: in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other pursuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can race car, you can do all
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cook, you can make a fabulous food
shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It satisfies all your senses like your
touch, your sight, your smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: your sound, but cannabis is the only thing
that hits all of those and you get your
[SPEAKER_00]: mind open too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, like that's the ultimate,
like something that satisfies all your
[SPEAKER_00]: senses and you get to bring it into your
body and experience it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anything else like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, uh, the food one's a good
analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have thought of that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because there's awesome chefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's visceral.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make the coolest stuff and it,
it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel good, but it doesn't
change your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's kind of, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the last couple of questions I
always like to wrap it up with is if you
[SPEAKER_02]: go back to one place, uh, in history and
time, so to speak, where would you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to collect some Landry seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would love to go to Iran right
before the Ayatollah kind of kicked in,
[SPEAKER_00]: like before they threw out the Shaw,
when it was like, when it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: have you ever seen pictures of Iran before
the, the, yeah, it was very Western
[SPEAKER_02]: looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so Western.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows no burkas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was so, it was like this modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was so happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must've had some really awesome
strains before, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, people say like Afghanistan
before the Soviet invasion, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might, you know, I think I'd really
like to go is I would love to go along the
[SPEAKER_00]: silk road, like way back, maybe like in
the, like thousand BC and just experience
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people talk about the hippie trail
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, all that's where all these
cool seeds and strains came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hippie trail is like relatively
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silk road was where it was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were, you know, it went from China
all the way to like the Mediterranean and
[SPEAKER_00]: people were trading, you know,
linens and seeds and fruits and nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course seeds were coming from
China, going through all these months
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from that things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, that was like the mod.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if there was one age, I think of
when cannabis was really kicking into gear
[SPEAKER_00]: and really people making some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was back on the silk road when it was
really pumping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which strain has, the way I normally
phrase it is which strain do you like the
[SPEAKER_02]: least, but I have a feeling you'll say you
like all strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll say which one, which one kind of
spoke to you the least?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like growing or taking into my
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see which one that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think if there's any strain
that just made me feel like super gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hard, you know, because of their
personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I smoked so many strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should like really write down like this
thing drove me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown some strains that kind of
sucked, but smoking it, what just sucks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe smoking hemp pawned off as
buds in some foreign country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I can't, I cannot answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know, but as soon as I find
something that really sucks, I will
[SPEAKER_00]: remember it and I will get it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to do an update at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a stumper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Final question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to end it on a bit of a
controversial one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really for you, but I think it'll be
pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to my friend Art from
Roundtable Selections for submitting this
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best way to end it will be
just to give a simple yes or no answer.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the earth is flat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, the universe is a really
unique and special magical place that
[SPEAKER_00]: amazes me every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't think it's flat,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get, I get amazed and every day at some
of the things I learned and I wouldn't put
[SPEAKER_00]: it past the earth to be some crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the water goes,
but I'm down, you know, I'm just happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: be here alive on planet earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's flat, if it's round,
it's square.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so stoked that I won the lottery
to be a human on this planet in this time
[SPEAKER_00]: with all these people doing all this crazy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the planet of the apes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really matter what shape or
form it is for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that wasn't a yes or no though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say if it was like a
Scantron and my life depended on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say no, it is not flat,
but I'm open to extreme possibilities and
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was flat, I don't really care
because I kind of dig just being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a fitting ending.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, very archetypal of Bodhi to
just be exploding with happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's flat, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's round, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for coming on the
show and spending a whopping four hours
[SPEAKER_02]: with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cruised past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still haven't even had more stuff to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jam it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we can jam it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to encourage people,
well not everyone, but people use your
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love everybody to definitely do
more psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is very important in a
breeding philosophy to connect with the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, the plants and yourself,
but do it responsibly and do it in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you think all forms of psychedelics,
any particular ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've got friends who particularly
advocate for mushrooms because they find
[SPEAKER_02]: it to be a little more au naturel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for me I would say if you're
interested in plants and plant breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis, my thing is like spirit
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say if you enjoy where
cannabis takes you and what it does for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, there's many plants on planet earth
that have been strategically planted here
[SPEAKER_00]: to open your mind and connect you into
deeper places, spaces, healings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis isn't the only plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's our primordial, I think it's
like our definitive ally plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think there's so many unique plants
out there just waiting to teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we can develop a greater
appreciation of nature ourselves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet by going into these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't advocate recreational psychedelic
use, but a responsible personal or group
[SPEAKER_00]: with a positive set and setting,
I think go for it, please everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, expand your mind, get in touch,
you know, find that special place in your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart that opens up to all creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever used salvia and what were
your experiences on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny is I collect salvia
strains too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually, I have about five now,
but you know, so I mean, is it OK if I,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little bit of a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we love stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, back when I was young,
I always wanted to be an ethnobotanist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my our first big adventure,
my friend was really into archaeology and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really into ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I brought my plants of the gods cards
and he brought all of his archaeological
[SPEAKER_00]: books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did our first big trip in our 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We landed in Cancun and we like hitchhiked
and rode buses because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure for tourism was a lot
different back in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all through the Yucatan,
all through Belize, all through Guatemala,
[SPEAKER_00]: all through Mexico and all the way back
all the way to Tijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my big thing is he wanted to see the
temples and I wanted to retrace the
[SPEAKER_00]: footsteps of our garden was on in his
search for the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we did all the temples,
we got to go up and we went to Wautla de
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimenez in the Sierra Mazatec to
experience the culture of mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: shamanism and all the other plants they
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things is we had our card
and it was a rare mint type plant that no
[SPEAKER_00]: one quite knew about or how it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a salvia divinorum before
people got kind of turned on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was before they realized that it
was a masticating plant, like it went
[SPEAKER_00]: through your mucous membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found a woman that took her all day
to hike to the place and got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she made us these like shampoos
and rock shakes where she just blended it
[SPEAKER_00]: in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, and you know, we drank those
and since you don't really, it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed in your gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got these really light effects from it
and it was so beautiful and so feminine
[SPEAKER_00]: and so special, but it didn't really hit
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always kind of had a special part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it became kind of a thing and
people started smoking it, I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: started collecting the strains and people
don't realize like that plant spirit is
[SPEAKER_00]: so, it's so moist and so feminine,
like it despises heat and fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these people that are smoking and
going cuckoo and running through walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I mean, it's kind of fun on YouTube
to watch the salvia freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gotta admit, in a kind of weird way,
but the key to salvia is you make a quid
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just put it in your lip and you
find some quiet place and she will take
[SPEAKER_00]: you deep into her healing garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so special and so magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I have smoked it and I have
had some very intense and unimaginable
[SPEAKER_00]: things happening, but really the key to
that plant is it's very feminine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very moist and it really loves just
to, you know, be stuck in your lip in a
[SPEAKER_00]: quid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sad that it's been outlawed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting that you mentioned that
intense is another word that I would use
[SPEAKER_02]: to describe my own experience with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, I didn't know that yeah,
you could just kind of sit it in your
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of just springing to mind from that
same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you toyed around with kratom at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not a, I have tried kratom
and, but you know, it's, I'm not a big
[SPEAKER_00]: opiate person and I'm not a big stimulant
and being those are, it's depending on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, it's location and if it's,
you know, the different STEM colors and
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology, how they have alkalites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an amazing adjunct for people
that are dealing with opiate dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it is a really amazing healing
plant, but it seemed for me, it was just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I don't like things that, that mess
with my physiology so much that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a body disturbances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it has kind of a, a strange
dosage response curve, like where if you
[SPEAKER_00]: take too much, you can be very
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never really connected to the kratom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think my favorite, you know,
if I had to pick stuff is I like cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my faves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, um, cactus like San Pedro and
Trichocereus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I, I do, ayahuasca is another
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it definitely has a place,
but it is kind of kicks your ass,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, just mushrooms and all we
need is mushrooms and cannabis and we're
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do like, I like all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have a cop plan, actually caught or
shot or whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you know, I, I'm open to try
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I just love all the plants
and all the plants spirit allies are just
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really that's, that's where my,
my heart goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd love to try a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not really, but I mean,
you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably grow great in your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I heard that the seeds
are a little hard to sprout, but I'll give
[SPEAKER_02]: it a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bit more green thumb nowadays than
when I last tried many years ago as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest ones ever are coca seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've, I've never been able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only have like a two week germination
period when, when they're fresh and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's literally like they mold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's super hard to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of get them moist and kind
of don't look at them for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that I, through a friend of
a friend, I knew someone who had like a
[SPEAKER_02]: single cocoa plant here in Australia
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And funnily enough, like what I had heard
from the guy who had it was that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: just wasn't even worth pursuing because
like it just, you know, kind of akin to
[SPEAKER_02]: the land racing, you know, he's just
flipping out in the Australian environment
[SPEAKER_02]: and just not being productive at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's an Indonesian or
Javanese variety of cocoa now that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might work better for your climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and people are growing it indoors
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in our area, we had a cocoa
plant that was kind of going around
[SPEAKER_00]: underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an imposter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was somebody claimed it was a cocoa,
but it really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had this caustic white sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever you would chew it,
your like lips would burst into flames,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tried cocaine yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe someday, but I love chewing
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I probably chewed my weight in cocoa
when I've been in like South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially up in the Andes, like oh my
God, I just, I mean, definitely roast your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth with all the lime, but what a
beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can see, you know, up there where
there's no oxygen and people are working
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like angels come down and touch
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel vibrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's got vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a healing crop for those Andean
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe you should stay away from
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like coca leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you guys have, you have the
bottle leaf, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of DMT containing like
trees in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes me back to being a young boy
doing the old acid base extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit of a sad story actually,
because you, there's certain parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia where it grows really well and
you go there and the trees have just been
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely stripped of all their bark and
yeah, they're really struggling because
[SPEAKER_02]: people have just gone to town on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's the big chaga craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants it to make their chaga and
yeah, it's a strange thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish people got more into Flaris,
but I guess it's just not a viable plant
[SPEAKER_00]: for extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's interesting is,
is kind of maybe a little peripheral,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was actually in that extraction of
the DMT from the Acacia probably about
[SPEAKER_02]: eight or nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when I first learned about it,
they were doing de-waxing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like removing the lipids from the
concentrates back then, but they certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't started doing that until much more
recently with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of interesting how
they were like ahead of the curb in that
[SPEAKER_02]: respect, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that kind of just goes back into
your basic kind of biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with us stoners, we don't really,
we never really had that science
[SPEAKER_00]: background, you know, and it seems like
when you're actually doing scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, you were kind of have to
involve those principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think as stoners, we just never got
it, but yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were de-waxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was that kind of like that
rough extract that was like the jungle
[SPEAKER_00]: spice that had that kind of yellow wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that something actually
constituents in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of pulling out some of the
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually only ever really came across
the yellow stuff myself, at least when I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's certainly an interesting
one if you were to look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never tried Ayahuasca personally,
and that's the one I'm most excited to try
[SPEAKER_02]: because a lot of people say, you know,
it's quite different to smoking it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is more of, you know, like you're
intense, kind of akin to a bong hit versus
[SPEAKER_02]: an edible, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and I mean, there's so many ways
now to do like, you can do like an
[SPEAKER_00]: ayahuasca analogue, you know, like a
Syrian roux mushroom mixture or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a mimosa, hostilis, Syrian roux.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many ways to kind of
emulate, or even with research chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: now, they're emulating like ayahuasca type
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they even think some of the most
ancient soma compounds were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: were different, you know, beta-carbolines
and like DMT sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's such an ancient alchemical
science, but yeah, I think you would enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: ayahuasca, but I would say maybe do it in
its natural environment, maybe get down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the jungles and really, or that,
or do it in some place that is in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that above all other things,
you know, like set and setting is the most
[SPEAKER_02]: important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing with ayahuasca because for a lot
of reasons, but it is very much a ritual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, I don't think there's many
people who would say that it's purely
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not recreational at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, it's very hard on your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're, you're, you're vomiting a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of what I did my
research thesis on ayahuasca shamanism in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Amazon when, when I was in the
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I had to do some grueling
stuff and it's, yeah, it's, I always tell
[SPEAKER_00]: people it's like, you know, now we have a
lot of this, well, if you do yoga and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to festivals that, yeah,
you got to try ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become like the, it's kind of like,
like cool person, write a passage if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like hip, but really the key to
ayahuasca is like, it's there to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either there to be healed,
learn to be a healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are really the only two
things that people should be using for it
[SPEAKER_00]: is if you're learning to be a healer,
an ayahuasca or if you're there to be
[SPEAKER_00]: healed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always tell people they should
take like an interview with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a first everybody should interview
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at least do it once and so that it
can impart its knowledge and kind of check
[SPEAKER_00]: you out and you can check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't, it's not a recreational
thing, but I think it's something kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like Burning Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always, you know, you should,
everybody should do it once kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: an eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should see a total solar eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things in life that I think
everybody should try and that'd probably
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question I'm really interested to
ask is out of all the countries you've
[SPEAKER_02]: been to, which one has left the most
positive, you know, kind of impact on you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in terms of both, you know,
things you're doing in the country
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether that be good stuff there or
whether you're able to good sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: good stuff back or just, you know,
like a combination of that as well as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like just you enjoy the place,
nice people, good food, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that type of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, number one, the Himalayas,
I just, I can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the food, Nepali food isn't that
great, but it's a stall bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot, but it's very nutritious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being up there, like just walking
those, you know, there's these,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's hard to explain,
like for backpacking and trekking,
[SPEAKER_00]: the beauty of the Himalayan trekking is
you're basically walking along these
[SPEAKER_00]: trails that have been there for thousands
of years that have gone, they'll go all
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Himalayas back when,
you know, and they all connect to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always like a little village
about five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each village is about five hours from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, you can always, you never have
to stay out in the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never have to pack like a sleeping
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never have to have food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just smoke, enjoy the beauty and
walk, and then walk to the next town,
[SPEAKER_00]: drink some tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spend the night if you want,
or you can keep on walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just, I just love the Himalayas,
but you know, second runner up,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something about Guatemala that I
love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was the first place I fell in
love with, or maybe it's that there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still such an indigenous presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it still has such its beautiful
culture and it has the ocean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Caribbean there, it has
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has, it has everything and people are
friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are probably the top two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like two places I need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you definitely need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to give people some
information on things if they want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper into kind of some of the things
I've talked about, like maybe some books
[SPEAKER_00]: that are good starter books or people to
look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would highly recommend if anybody's
interested in just more of a reading with
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart, look into any of Steven
Bruner's books or interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he is definitely connected to that
style of interacting with plants with your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great book that's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants of the Gods, Richard Evans
Schultes, Albert Hoffman, awesome guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent book.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more of a lighter,
more meditative approach to connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: with plants, I would say anything by
Elliot Cohen, like plant spirit medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, if you torrent or anything
like that, find some place that has all
[SPEAKER_00]: the Terrence McKenna's interviews,
like on one little thing, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: like a million gigs and download every
single Terrence McKenna interview you can
[SPEAKER_00]: ever get and just listen to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the most ultimate dude on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian Ratch, John Williams,
Jonathan Ott, I mean Wade Davis,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Plotkin, Timothy Plowman,
all these ethnobotanists, these are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, these are my heroes and I really
think people would benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think any other support hero
would get sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of things that are
just so, oh, you know, it's a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: My degree was in basically kind of like,
it was anthropology or religion with an
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasis on plants and culture and
religion, so I always wanted to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: ethnobotanist, but I could never handle
the botany and the science, nor the put
[SPEAKER_00]: you in a box thing, so I kind of found a
way around it and did ethnobotany without
[SPEAKER_00]: the botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there is one book that people are
kind of like a dummy like me and are more
[SPEAKER_00]: artistic and don't want to try and figure
everything out, there's a great book
[SPEAKER_00]: called, it's called Practical Botany for
Gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's by Joff Hodge and it's got
pictures and if you want to kind of know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're talking about but not want to
know, this is a great book for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like botany for dummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has great things about all the
classical breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think, anyone else that I think is
super awesome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely read Steven Bruner's books,
Plants of the Gods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and Luther Burbank, if you want to
know of a cool botanist that's still
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to his heart and to the spirit,
definitely get into Luther Burbank,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most amazing breeders on earth
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Created I think like 800 different kinds
of fruits and vegetables from Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has amazing quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of his famous quotes is like
the most important thing to a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program is love.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was another one of his things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but if you're into botany
and you still want to be kind of groovy
[SPEAKER_00]: and esoteric, definitely Luther Burbank
and travel, please travel, please collect
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, please make seeds, please share
seeds, please be nice to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make this an awesome community and
let's really push this thing into amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, that sounds amazing and it's
a very good, again, very archetypal of
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowie just spreading the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess I always get shy and I get
all paranoid about these conversations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really if it's with good people,
it's just you're just talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Duncho was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was live and there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like live because it's raw, but this is
nice too because you get to really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like get to talk more and like really kind
of come from where I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's one of the things we often
hear about.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people enjoy about this show is that
people are able to kind of get a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper into their thoughts on an issue and
not just kind of maybe moving on to the
[SPEAKER_02]: next issue straight away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I definitely like the
dynamic approach and I like how,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more one is more like it's more of a
show and you're on the spot and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really getting out and then this one's
more of kind of like you're like having
[SPEAKER_00]: tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they both are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both serve their purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's neat to have both
sides of the coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, you know, you're kind
of like is the Nard war of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews, you know, Nard war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like the crazy interviewer,
like he comes up with all the wackiest
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and all the guys are like,
where in the hell did you figure that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be like the Nard war of cannabis
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it, you know, doing these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, what I say to everyone is I
just I just make the show that I wish
[SPEAKER_02]: already existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm just making a show that I would
sit down and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this makes a lot of people happy
because everybody's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's I guess it's nice to hear someone's
voice and just, you know, I hope I just
[SPEAKER_00]: got across some.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole thing was I just wanted people to
maybe see a different a different reality
[SPEAKER_00]: of how we can make this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that it kind of comes through in
the interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that people definitely will
have that experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, it's something that has kind
of been necessary in a way, because a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of a lot of breeders do, including myself,
you know, do approach this very much from
[SPEAKER_02]: that scientific point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really nice to have that contrast
and kind of juxtaposition to see that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not all just, you know, one way,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I always tell people it's
like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how you breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you make something amazing,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you put your heart and soul
into it, it wasn't just like a one-off
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proof's in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all that counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science or quackery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, just in case my previous one
got a bit interrupted, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you so much for coming on the show
and for spreading all your knowledge and
[SPEAKER_02]: love with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it was my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel really good to let my heart speak,
you know, and so thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a doubt, one of my favorite
episodes so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everyone was able to sponge up
everything they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thank you to Bodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: His wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic gardening solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you.
[SPEAKER_01]: La la la la la la.
Oh.
