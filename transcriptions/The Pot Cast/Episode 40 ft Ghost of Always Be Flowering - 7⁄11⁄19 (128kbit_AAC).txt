[SPEAKER_02]: friends a big thank you and welcome to the
next guest on the show the CEO of always
[SPEAKER_02]: being flowery thanks so very much to
ghosts for coming on appreciate it man
[SPEAKER_02]: thanks for having me on here not a problem
my friend so first question we ask people
[SPEAKER_03]: these days what are you currently smoking
on right now we're smoking on some PK
[SPEAKER_03]: sherb that we made so it's the Malibu PK
with the reverse sunset sherbert and
[SPEAKER_03]: before that some tricks by my buddy grow
low key gg4 Mendo breath that he haunted
[SPEAKER_02]: wow interesting there's a there's a lot
going on there so I mean first of all tell
[SPEAKER_02]: us about the sunset sherb what how would
you describe the crosses you made with
[SPEAKER_03]: that one I'd say the sunset sherb crosses
have all been pretty beneficial in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of what it added to the structure it's a
really interesting plant probably the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that I've been most excited about
since cookies and I actually passed on it
[SPEAKER_03]: for a couple of years because I wasn't
interested in hearing anything about it
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly because I didn't really think that
it would be better than the cookies in any
[SPEAKER_03]: way shape or form it just seemed kind of
like derivative so I passed on it for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while until I actually got to try a sample
and I was impressed by it it's got the
[SPEAKER_03]: creamy kind of deep musky flavor and it's
a little bit less cookie doughy dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: and I like the yield on it the structure
on it the growth habit super super proper
[SPEAKER_03]: plant in terms of how it grows and
stretches and the yield from it I'd say
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's probably added a lot to the
crosses and with the PK being lower
[SPEAKER_03]: yielding a little bit more finicky of a
plant you find that what the crosses of it
[SPEAKER_03]: produce are heartier more vigorous plants
yeah that sounds really good and I've got
[SPEAKER_02]: to admit I've actually never tried pure
sherbert that's why I'm always interested
[SPEAKER_02]: to hear people's take on it but to cross
over the other side of things you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned you crossed it to the the pure
Kush I'm always interested because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: so many different pure Kush's is the
Malibu your personal favorite one so I
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly think that a lot of them are very
very similar if not identical I think
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes when people see them what all
they're really seeing is just different
[SPEAKER_03]: growers examples of a similar plant at
this point with the OGs in general which
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you've seen a good amount when
you've been when you've been out west it's
[SPEAKER_03]: very very similar I think there's really
only a couple of different profiles that
[SPEAKER_03]: stand out there's the more like gassy
lemony one like the SFV there's the more
[SPEAKER_03]: earthy one like the Malibu and then
there's kind of what you find and a good
[SPEAKER_03]: example recently was like the black
triangle from Bodhi that triangle 88 g13
[SPEAKER_03]: hash plant very very dank like what I call
like the traditional Kush type profile and
[SPEAKER_03]: the Malibu and the Topanga honestly a lot
of them when I've seen them they're very
[SPEAKER_03]: very similar so I can't really say that
there would be much of a difference
[SPEAKER_03]: between them somebody who would probably
be better suited to speak on that might be
[SPEAKER_03]: the doctor from archive he might have seen
more I mean I've seen the Malibu when I
[SPEAKER_03]: was in San Diego in like the early 2000s
and when I've seen the Topanga brought up
[SPEAKER_03]: very very similar in my opinion and I know
there's I think there's the Hollywood PK 2
[SPEAKER_02]: is what they're calling it as well yeah
there's a there's a stack of different
[SPEAKER_02]: ones I guess the thing I'm most interested
in is do you think that the more lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: based OGs came maybe from an s1 of say the
the more earthy the more pure Kush type
[SPEAKER_02]: ones or do you think maybe it was the
other way around or do you think they just
[SPEAKER_03]: evolved independently that's a good
question I mean I would think that they
[SPEAKER_03]: came from the more earthy ones just
because I kind of feel like that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: base of that genetic so it would make
sense to me that an outlier might be the
[SPEAKER_03]: more lemony one and the lemony ones are
very very popular for a specific reason
[SPEAKER_03]: because they have that they have that
gassy profile but they also have that
[SPEAKER_03]: stick to your palate flavor that pretty
much cuts through anything and so I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like it was probably an outlier of the
earthier Kush's that people were probably
[SPEAKER_02]: getting back in the day yeah that
certainly seems to make sense and then so
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess to kind of bring this little bit
full circle a lot of people often talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about feeling like there's a Kush
component within girls scouts and by
[SPEAKER_02]: extension within the Sherbs do you see
that yourself and if so what type of Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: influence do you think is within the Sherb
so at least with the Girl Scout cookies I
[SPEAKER_03]: would say when you look at it and the way
that it grows it grows very very similar
[SPEAKER_03]: to the SFVs in terms of just the way the
flower sets the size of the flowers on
[SPEAKER_03]: them the internodal spacing on it and the
long petioles that you see on them if
[SPEAKER_03]: you've ever seen like the OGs grown or
whatnot they don't require a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: plucking because they don't they don't
pull that they don't put out a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves they stretch a whole lot and that's
similar to what we first saw in the forum
[SPEAKER_03]: with the Sherb I could see it as well it's
just selected away from that to a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that stacks a little bit more is a little
bit tighter puts out fatter flowers that
[SPEAKER_03]: the colas are you know three or four
flowers set together not not kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: what you see with the SFVs or the OGs and
it's firmer the the branches aren't as
[SPEAKER_03]: floppy with the OGs you know they require
a lot of work because you know they they
[SPEAKER_03]: want they want to get all kind of over the
place they require a lot of maintenance on
[SPEAKER_02]: them yeah okay and so overall are you put
off by these types of structures because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a common complaint we hear from
some people yes and no I think it really
[SPEAKER_03]: just depends on what it is you're trying
to achieve I mean a properly grown OG is
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the best flowers you'll ever see so
to me it's worth it and there's a reason
[SPEAKER_03]: why it stuck around so long I think part
of why we stopped seeing the OGs in the
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of volume that we used to see them in
is just because the price dropped on the
[SPEAKER_03]: market and so you know it wasn't worth
growing anymore it was worth growing
[SPEAKER_03]: something that was a heavier yielder that
required less work that was less finicky
[SPEAKER_03]: so for me personally I love a phenomenal
OG and I've never seen a plant with better
[SPEAKER_03]: structure let's say that actually
delivered the same type of flower so it if
[SPEAKER_03]: you could find it in something that had
better structure and growth habits I would
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely take it but having never really
seen anything like that myself I'm you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I'm saying it had it stuck around for
a long time for a reason and I know
[SPEAKER_03]: inspecta has done some s1 work with the
triangle and the chem 91 and still though
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants still look even though he's got
some that stack a little bit better it
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like there's they still have the
same viney structure it just requires a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of certainly so you just gotta grow it
properly so you raised a really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting point which is kind of on a
very different topic but I'd love to
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly go there where you mentioned that
although these OGs were elite and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing flower people stopped growing them
because they kind of fell out of favor and
[SPEAKER_02]: I witnessed this firsthand when I was in
the States whereby I had a bag of what was
[SPEAKER_02]: meant to be some sort of like exotic type
of cookie type of thing you know and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was grown it looked nice but it had no
turps had no flavor was really quite bland
[SPEAKER_02]: but it looked pretty good and then next to
it was a bag of the the clone only
[SPEAKER_02]: headband that's the same one that mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob has so I know that it's like a really
good one and that the smell was just super
[SPEAKER_02]: piney lemony gassy like everything you'd
want the flavor was on point and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: having this talk with people and they're
like yeah these bags would go for about
[SPEAKER_02]: the same price and I was like what but
like the headbands clearly way better and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were like yeah but people have
smelled that one before like they used to
[SPEAKER_02]: that smell you know do you feel like
that's a problem within the consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: market that we can get to this point where
shittily grown exotics are fetching the
[SPEAKER_02]: same or more than like a really killer
tried and tested clone only but just
[SPEAKER_02]: because of like a name and a hype thing
they're willing to go with the the exotic
[SPEAKER_03]: one yeah I mean I think I think we're
already there you know at this point
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of what what people are
terming exotics a term that they're using
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty loosely now but there's a lot of
those going around and literally just just
[SPEAKER_03]: putting it I mean honestly at this point
just putting it in the right in the right
[SPEAKER_03]: bag makes all the difference and there is
there is a segment of the market that will
[SPEAKER_03]: pay for that and the general populace
doesn't really know the difference at all
[SPEAKER_03]: so the staples like I mean I don't know if
you remember the J1 I used to love the J1
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was a phenomenal flower really
really good high nice taste people do not
[SPEAKER_03]: like Jack they've seen so much Jack
especially in Cali but they don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: see it anymore they're over it so I think
like the higher-end market they want I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean if you've noticed there's you know
do-si-do cross with gelato and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: do-si-do cross with sherb and that's
really what people want I mean I made
[SPEAKER_03]: something pretty weird a couple years ago
and it has no traction it's a Vietnam
[SPEAKER_03]: black tie grand doggie perp crossed with a
grand doggie perp banana limon yeah and
[SPEAKER_03]: that was a cross that took a long time to
make I made you know I selected the limon
[SPEAKER_03]: from I selected the limon male I hit it to
the banana cut we had I found a male in
[SPEAKER_03]: that and hit it to a grand doggie perp
female then I found a male from that and
[SPEAKER_03]: then separate from that I had selected a
Vietnam black tie from ace and hit that
[SPEAKER_03]: with a grand doggie perp male and then
selected a female from that and then
[SPEAKER_03]: worked together that female and the other
male and it's a whole lot of work in there
[SPEAKER_03]: and really nobody really has any interest
in it I mean it's you know a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that I know that that that do care
about quality flour they've told me
[SPEAKER_03]: they've grown it and they've told me it's
some of the most unique turps they've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: seen and they love it but generally
speaking if you put something like that on
[SPEAKER_03]: the market number one most people you
tried to explain all those genetics to
[SPEAKER_03]: them they they would just go right over
their head they would get a blank look on
[SPEAKER_03]: their face but if you just tell them oh
it's girls got cookie cross with OG Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: okay they probably know those things and
they're just gonna go for what they know
[SPEAKER_03]: versus you know what something completely
unique and different and that's not you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's it's kind of where we're at now
where people will take poorly grown
[SPEAKER_03]: example of some kind of exotic that looks
good or photographs well I mean honestly
[SPEAKER_03]: people are buying things because they can
take a picture of and post it on their
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram so if the headband smells
phenomenal to you in person has a great
[SPEAKER_03]: effect but the purple punch whatever cross
looks good and they can photograph it and
[SPEAKER_03]: put it on their Instagram and get a bunch
of likes that's what they're gonna do most
[SPEAKER_03]: people I mean that's what they're gonna do
all things being equal so yeah no I
[SPEAKER_02]: totally get that do you feel like this is
gonna ultimately negatively affect
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone in the growers start growing out
these strains and we maybe lose some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these better ones like objectively better
but just not demanded I do there's been a
[SPEAKER_03]: huge shift in terms of people cultivating
varieties that are photogenic because they
[SPEAKER_03]: want them to look good on Instagram some
plants don't photograph well no matter how
[SPEAKER_03]: you grow them like the Chem D is kind of
is one of those plants it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: photograph well doesn't really I mean it
looks okay in a bag it can be done right
[SPEAKER_03]: as it were but it's never gonna look like
a gelato sherb cross would look it's never
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna have that bag appeal it's not gonna
have the purple tones the photograph well
[SPEAKER_03]: so there's a lot of genetics that are
getting lost off and I mean even even when
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried to share genetics with people
to help back up some of the work they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't care because if it's not something
that they can immediately put into
[SPEAKER_03]: production most people don't want to do it
and so there's there's really it cost a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of money it takes a lot of time to
back up all these genetics and I know
[SPEAKER_03]: that's something that inspector could
relate to it's a conversation that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: had here and there about that just it's a
big commitment to do all that work and
[SPEAKER_03]: keep all that together most people don't
want it I mean a simple a similar example
[SPEAKER_03]: is a plant we have called the Lucy it's a
chem 91 butterscotch Hawaiian very very
[SPEAKER_03]: unique terpene profile not the highest
yielder a little bit finicky whatnot but
[SPEAKER_03]: it's you know it's not something that I
don't think anyone in my circle has kept
[SPEAKER_03]: it around I think one person that operates
a rec facility has it and other than that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not a plant that anyone really wants
but when I hit it with the tricks and a
[SPEAKER_03]: friend of mine has grown them out now the
owner of the facility came by and when he
[SPEAKER_03]: was checking out all the different stuff
that they were growing what he remarked
[SPEAKER_03]: about amongst you know maybe six or seven
different breeders work that they had
[SPEAKER_03]: going there was that the patch of work
that was that they that had that had come
[SPEAKER_03]: from my work all the strange plants that
my friend had selected independently were
[SPEAKER_03]: the most unique profiled plants he had
seen and one one was that Lucy he said he
[SPEAKER_03]: never smelled anything like it before and
for me that's that's a big part of why I
[SPEAKER_03]: keep those plants around because although
they're of zero value to most people
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly because they don't really know what
they're worth they don't really see the
[SPEAKER_03]: value in it they don't understand that if
you cross it into something else you're
[SPEAKER_03]: opening up a whole new gene pool like but
if you just hitch a lot of the dosy dough
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah you're gonna get a bunch of plants
that smell similar that give kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody in Iowa let's say the ability to
grow that type of a plant and smell that
[SPEAKER_03]: type of a profile but at the end of the
day you're not really doing anything
[SPEAKER_03]: special you're not really opening up the
possibility of anything unique I like to
[SPEAKER_03]: take things from the far end of the
spectrum and combine them together and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's I think where you're gonna find
really really different plants but
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody has to keep those plants around
and you literally keep nobody wants them
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't find people that you could you'd
have to pay people to keep them around for
[SPEAKER_03]: you if you can't keep them.
[SPEAKER_02]: God so many things you just said I just so
deeply relate to like yeah I know what you
[SPEAKER_02]: mean and what I wanted to first ask you
because I got so many things I need to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you in relation to that first thing the
Chem 91 butterscotch cross is that from
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodie or Rado?
[SPEAKER_03]: No so that's not Rado's butterscotch I
don't even I don't know the lineage of his
[SPEAKER_03]: butterscotch this was made by someone
named poor white farmer he was off ICMAG
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago and I believe it might have been
from Reef I believe the butterscotch
[SPEAKER_03]: Hawaiian came from Reef and he found a
mail and there hit the Chem 91 and then
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody named Easy Rasta selected the
clone he passed it to a couple of our
[SPEAKER_03]: friends on ICMAG and that's how I ended up
getting it and I don't know that either of
[SPEAKER_03]: them are I mean they may still be alive
but I don't neither of them either I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't seen either of them active in
years so I'm not sure where where that
[SPEAKER_03]: work lies but yeah no that's not from Rado
I'm not even sure what the lineage on his
[SPEAKER_03]: butterscotch is to be honest I don't know
if you might know what it is yeah no I
[SPEAKER_02]: would probably have to look into it before
I say something incorrect as I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to vet some of the more random
things I say recently so I'll hold off on
[SPEAKER_02]: that one I remember seeing a post with
that Chem 91 butterscotch cross in it and
[SPEAKER_02]: I remembered seeing in that same post and
you also just mentioned it that there was
[SPEAKER_02]: like a I think it was cross to tricks and
yeah I crossed it to the tricks yeah and
[SPEAKER_02]: so I wanted to ask you a little bit about
tricks I noticed that sometimes you refer
[SPEAKER_03]: to it as GB six tricks what does that mean
so originally I believe that when low-key
[SPEAKER_03]: selected the plant he got it as as gorilla
breath that he did a project with Gromer
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was a bunch of work that came
out of that and that's one of those plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and when he selected it I think it was
just the gorilla breath six and he named
[SPEAKER_03]: it tricks because of the flavor profile on
it the way like the way like the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: the smell that it gives off and so the
shortened version is just GB six tricks
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than gorilla breath six tricks that
makes sense as a quick little side note
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you think of our friend Groma you
know I've had a few people come on the
[SPEAKER_02]: show saying well he's very blatantly
ripped off gauge green but then on the
[SPEAKER_02]: other hand people seem to turn a bit of a
blind eye to that and you know friendly
[SPEAKER_03]: with him what's your take on that
situation I mean yeah he obviously did so
[SPEAKER_03]: that's I don't think that's up for
discussion at this point because the work
[SPEAKER_03]: was all based on the Mendo breath and I
think he has a line recently that's just
[SPEAKER_03]: another gauge green kind of rip I think he
took I forget what a grateful breath or
[SPEAKER_03]: something and started a whole nother line
with that so but yeah I mean he you know
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's it's one of those things where
it would have been previously frowned upon
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly not frowned upon now I'm sure he
made a whole bunch of money for himself
[SPEAKER_03]: and he sells them at a low price point
because there's really no work involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: them I mean you know I could take a pack
from you know archive right now and do the
[SPEAKER_03]: same thing and people I mean there's
people who have done that with with work
[SPEAKER_03]: that was put out with my work so it's kind
of one of those things where you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: he gave people access to something he did
it in numbers he did it in volume he cut
[SPEAKER_03]: the price real low so personally you know
for me no but for people who are just
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to make some money I totally get it
it makes sense it was there to be had and
[SPEAKER_03]: people clearly support him and I mean the
work that's come from it hasn't been bad
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know it means a lot of it is
dosy dough and Mendo breath you know dosy
[SPEAKER_03]: dough from archive and Mendo breath from
gauge both both you know made in
[SPEAKER_03]: collaboration with NorCal and that OGKB
clone so not really I mean not not
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I would do to be honest but
not mad at him either because I'm sure he
[SPEAKER_03]: made a pile of money off it and is still
making a pile of money off of it there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people out there doing work with
integrity that are broke so you know you
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of kind of look at it and see really
at the end of the day like who's really
[SPEAKER_02]: winning there it's interesting that
exactly what you said holds true in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion the best clone that exists in
Australia is a jelly breath clone from
[SPEAKER_02]: in-house genetics and that's just dosy
dough across Mendo breath you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just his version his feminized version of
essentially the peanut butter breath from
[SPEAKER_02]: Groma but yeah you can't deny it's some
really nice weed but I just wanted to loop
[SPEAKER_02]: back for a moment the reason why all of
this stimulated my interest initially
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in regards to that gorilla
breath was that I had heard rumors of
[SPEAKER_02]: other well-known strains being given the
same genetics and I probably need to
[SPEAKER_02]: explain this a little bit specifically I'd
heard that smell boats rainbow SS OG was
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact just gorilla glue for Mendo breath
and I'd asked him about it and he was like
[SPEAKER_02]: what no way like neither of those plants
are you can't even see any traits from
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants in this thing but what it
made me realize was when I was hearing
[SPEAKER_02]: these rumors it was just kind of like two
really popular strains thrown together it
[SPEAKER_02]: was almost as if like people didn't know
what a certain cross was so they were like
[SPEAKER_02]: oh it's probably like gg4 cross Mendo
breath like as in like it was just two
[SPEAKER_02]: popular things you could throw together
and imply that someone's just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: chucking these two popular things together
have you ever heard of any other strains
[SPEAKER_02]: being called like oh it's probably gg4
Mendo breath even though like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really appear to be or anything like that
or is that just my own little weird
[SPEAKER_03]: experience no yeah and I mean I'm kind of
familiar with smell boat but I had never
[SPEAKER_03]: heard that about that particular cross I'm
sure that somebody else has done a gg4
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo breath I would be surprised if they
hadn't that sure there's a gg4 dosido out
[SPEAKER_03]: there I could bet on that one for sure the
Mendo breath you know it wasn't it was
[SPEAKER_03]: they both kind of came at the same time
and then one end it up obviously exceeding
[SPEAKER_03]: the popularity of the other significantly
in my opinion that being the dosido I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: we actually we actually were the ones that
that sold that clone originally that
[SPEAKER_03]: norcal cut when that cut actually came out
it was through a delivery service that I
[SPEAKER_03]: had in SF at the time and we released the
dosido norcal cut the number six and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo breath cut which was the platinum
and those you know one one really took off
[SPEAKER_03]: which was that dosido and the other one
didn't really trend as much was the Mendo
[SPEAKER_03]: breath so really though I think the person
that's worked with the Mendo breath the
[SPEAKER_03]: most obviously besides gage has has been
gromer because he worked with it for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time it has to be years now yeah I
don't really know that anyone else has
[SPEAKER_02]: really worked with it that significantly
yeah well I mean I guess just to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: wrap up this little sag we've been talking
about what are your thoughts on gage I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean they're weird there's no denying that
I don't think there's a they're a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit strange muscle I'm friends with norcal
and norcal and my buddy frostboss and my
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy unknown prophet myself we all go
back a long way in the Bay Area the four
[SPEAKER_03]: of us and norcal was how I came to know
about gage but he's he's a really good guy
[SPEAKER_03]: he's open to working with a lot of people
and he worked with gage in some way shape
[SPEAKER_03]: or form my understanding of their
relationship was that it was not very
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial to him and so in that regard to
me not really people that I'm a huge fan
[SPEAKER_03]: of simply because if my friend says that
it didn't go right I know the kind of guy
[SPEAKER_03]: he is so I imagine it's on their side plus
I've seen them caught up in all kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of online debating and whatnot
and people who debate online are not
[SPEAKER_03]: people that I want to associate with so
the work is interesting they seem weird
[SPEAKER_03]: and I personally have never run any of
their work besides the Mendo breath
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings that norcal gave me but I know a
lot of people like their work so you know
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I think one of them is a flat
earther that's a little bit strange to me
[SPEAKER_03]: and then just the way that they present
themselves online is kind of off-putting
[SPEAKER_03]: to me and the reality is besides the Mendo
breath I don't really know any of their
[SPEAKER_02]: other work that I'm intrigued by yeah
that's an interesting point I mean I'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: honest there's a few of their crosses I've
seen that do catch my eye particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: that high school sweetheart one but I
agree with you they're an interesting crew
[SPEAKER_02]: and our friend Michael Fong the flat
earther he's another interesting chap and
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be surprised if one day we get
him on the show I think it'd be a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: chap but anyway let's let's take it back
now we've been having a good little detour
[SPEAKER_02]: here let's go back to our original first
question which we normally start the show
[SPEAKER_02]: with what was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: wow yeah my first experience with cannabis
was with some friends of mine when I was
[SPEAKER_03]: younger one of their parents was a dead
head and I was spending the night over
[SPEAKER_03]: there and they stole they stole a little
bit of flour from them and we sat up after
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone went to bed and smoked it laid
down and had that typical first experience
[SPEAKER_03]: where you're wondering like am I feeling
anything or what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: everything went fine didn't think anything
of it went to bed the next day woke up
[SPEAKER_03]: felt a little bit different just thinking
okay well clearly it's not it's not what
[SPEAKER_03]: the dare program and everybody else said
it was I think I was about like 13 at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time and then I really didn't didn't smoke
much after that it took a couple years
[SPEAKER_03]: before I really got into smoking because
it didn't it didn't really grab me and
[SPEAKER_03]: then I remember meeting with some friends
where I was living in Miami at the time
[SPEAKER_03]: and grabbing some flour from one of their
older brothers he actually had some
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry and remember smoking that and
being like oh yeah okay like I get it now
[SPEAKER_03]: and pretty much obsessed with that I mean
I think we ended up going to see a movie
[SPEAKER_03]: at the mall and I we were waiting for the
movie we went up in the parking garage to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke right before the movie I walked back
in there were some fences in front of the
[SPEAKER_03]: movie theater I remember laying down and
telling them when it was time to go in I
[SPEAKER_03]: said no I'm good you guys can go I'm good
they told me like you can't lay out here
[SPEAKER_03]: man you have to you have to come into the
movie theater so I went in with them but I
[SPEAKER_03]: loved it I completely fell in love with it
it's I mean it's a it's a plant that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it changed my life I've been
dedicated to this plant for you know over
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years now and in spite of everything
else any little detours I've taken in life
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always circled back to the plant
constantly it's it's I mean it changed my
[SPEAKER_03]: life clearly just like a lot of the people
that you probably speak to clearly we've
[SPEAKER_03]: dedicated a long like a lot of time and
energy into this so yeah I've been I was
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of spoiled though because I'd never
seen I'd never seen regs before and in
[SPEAKER_03]: Florida there was really only like regs or
like like like nugget you know it was like
[SPEAKER_03]: oh you either had you're either had krippi
or you had regs and I was spoiled because
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd only smoked like I'd only smoked
krippi I only smoked like hind butt or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you want to call it I only smoked
like nicer indoor flower and then I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember the first time I saw some regs we
all we all faded in on I'm supposed to be
[SPEAKER_03]: like I think like a quarter pound and when
my friends asked me to fade in on it I was
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of surprised by like the small amount
of money that it was and when they showed
[SPEAKER_03]: up with it and started breaking it up I
didn't even know what the seeds were I was
[SPEAKER_03]: completely confused about the stems the
seeds all of that I tried to take one hit
[SPEAKER_03]: of a blunt they rolled and I said no I'm
good I'm just gonna hit my pipe in my
[SPEAKER_02]: little jar weed that I brought with me Wow
there you go and was that when you say
[SPEAKER_02]: regs was that kind of like brickweed or
just like not as good as kind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brickweed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brickweed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pressed Miami brickweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah wow and so I know that back in those
days names weren't a big thing but do you
[SPEAKER_02]: remember the first name strain you ever
smoked?
[SPEAKER_03]: So my friend's brother would get blueberry
that was the first thing that I actually
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked and then in Florida there was juicy
fruit which was like another one that was
[SPEAKER_03]: popular I want to say the other one was
called orange crush and there was like one
[SPEAKER_03]: more that I can't remember off top but
really there was only I don't know how it
[SPEAKER_03]: is in Australia but when in Florida there
you only could really get from people that
[SPEAKER_03]: you knew and if it wasn't like brickweed
basically out of like some suspect spot it
[SPEAKER_03]: was through the same kind of contacts and
they just had the same type of stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: so you really didn't have much of an
option and so we would get a lot of that
[SPEAKER_03]: juicy fruit that orange crush I forget
what some of the other ones were and then
[SPEAKER_03]: a friend of mine actually grew some of the
first stuff from seed I ever saw which was
[SPEAKER_03]: they had brought back some shishkeberry
seeds and so that was that was like the
[SPEAKER_03]: first actual something from seed that I
where I knew the people that actually grew
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool okay so did you have like an
inclination towards spice of life at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point?
[SPEAKER_02]: given shishkeberry kind of open your eyes
or was that like an afterthought?
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest I didn't even know who they
were I was so paranoid about any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: online searching for anything at that time
that I didn't want anything to do with it
[SPEAKER_03]: and in Florida if you knew someone like
you just you just didn't say anything
[SPEAKER_03]: because the people that were growing were
so quiet about it that you just you
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't say anything about anything to
anybody so it wasn't even really it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really even a conversation that you could
have with someone to even ask questions
[SPEAKER_03]: about it was more like here I've got this
take it you don't want it okay you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: have it now because you took too long you
asked questions they didn't like it so you
[SPEAKER_03]: just you know you had it was like if you
didn't grow up with certain people you
[SPEAKER_03]: were just you were excluded from certain
circles you just weren't welcome so I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't even know about Steve or spice of
life or any of that but I have I have
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoyed some of his work I like the blue
satellite from him I would like to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: some shishkeberry at some point it's kind
of a shame because a lot of that flower
[SPEAKER_03]: nowadays with the way the rec markets are
moving here in the states they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: really desirable because a lot of those
higher terpene interesting different
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties they don't they don't test over
20% and consumers in the stores that's
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what they're really obsessed with
is like varieties over 20% and you know if
[SPEAKER_03]: if something has a really really unique
terpene profile but it tests 13 or 14%
[SPEAKER_03]: it's gonna be eliminated that's another
thing that's gonna affect the gene pool
[SPEAKER_03]: going forward is like this focus on
commercial breeding is really is really
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna change what people are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's interesting because I think
it's this the same situation in the states
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's certainly the case down under
that there's this whole kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: Renaissance and explosion of craft beers
and there's this idea of like people are
[SPEAKER_02]: moving away from just your stock standard
commercial stuff and looking for that more
[SPEAKER_02]: boutique type of thing do you think
that'll ever happen with cannabis or the
[SPEAKER_02]: current trend you just described where
people are kind of a bit ignorant of what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're actually looking for as a consumer
do you think that will continue I think I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it might happen I think it'll take
time and by then I think we'll have lost a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the genetics they'll they'll be
people here and there that have preserved
[SPEAKER_03]: some things there'll be some seeds that
we'll be able to pull from but I do feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like there's a lot of diversity that's
getting lost and work that's not being
[SPEAKER_03]: done one day consumers might might be
educated enough might be interested enough
[SPEAKER_03]: in asking for that but currently with with
the way the regulatory landscape is set up
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very difficult to operate and I think
that in the future when we're able to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually have interstate commerce so if
you know if a facility was located let's
[SPEAKER_03]: say and then you know Arizona but it could
ship all over the country kind of like you
[SPEAKER_03]: know a small vineyard might I think you'll
have more access to that boutique market
[SPEAKER_03]: the same way that the breweries do but
right now with the way it's set up and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know just kind of having to operate within
a state and comply with the local
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations and if you want to expand into
another state you have to set up another
[SPEAKER_03]: facility it's just not it's geared towards
rich people it's geared towards the
[SPEAKER_03]: wealthiest people and right now what
they're doing is they're grabbing the
[SPEAKER_03]: hugest piece of the markets possible
they're setting up all across the country
[SPEAKER_03]: so they're you know they'll be everywhere
before they give the craft people kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: a chance to expand and Oregon has a small
craft market but it's been brutal and
[SPEAKER_03]: Oklahoma's about to go through the same
thing a lot of people are popping up over
[SPEAKER_03]: there because it's so inexpensive but
what's gonna happen is the same thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: happened in Oregon markets was gonna get
decimated and a lot of people are gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: lose are gonna are gonna lose what they've
invested not everyone is gonna survive
[SPEAKER_03]: that but I do think that Oregon is a place
where you might see that craft market and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I could point to brands like
resin ranchers smaller companies that feed
[SPEAKER_03]: you know they understand the market and
they're not they're not over producing
[SPEAKER_03]: they could expand they choose not to
they've found a happy medium in a way to
[SPEAKER_03]: survive within that but they also had deep
deep roots in the medical scene before the
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational market hit so they had those
relationships in place they had local
[SPEAKER_03]: connections they were able to make the
transition and I'm sure at some point you
[SPEAKER_03]: know if we spoke to them they would tell
you it wasn't easy but they managed to
[SPEAKER_03]: make it work and people know you know and
our archive is a good curator of local
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of craft products in Oregon if people
want to if you can get your product on
[SPEAKER_02]: their shelf it says something about your
company yeah right I remember when I
[SPEAKER_02]: visited the Oregon store a few years ago
they definitely had some nice flower there
[SPEAKER_02]: something I forgot to mention earlier when
you're talking about J1 how good is J1 I
[SPEAKER_03]: love J1 I can't believe I love J1 people
people maybe it's me and you then but
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't people don't seem to care for
it I think it's a phenomenal flower I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's resinous it's flavorful it
grows impeccably it yields well I love the
[SPEAKER_03]: high from it I feel like a lot of people
they want the narcotic high nowadays they
[SPEAKER_03]: have for years but they especially seem to
want it now I don't know if it's just the
[SPEAKER_03]: current state of affairs or whatnot but I
think the J1 is a phenomenal flower I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: I was I grew that plant for a long time
and I was I was bummed when I lost it I
[SPEAKER_03]: know it still exists I know some people
still grow it and really I mean it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack profile with better structure better
flower better finishing time better bag
[SPEAKER_03]: appeal I think it's amazing I love it yeah
the thing I noticed about it is no one
[SPEAKER_03]: breeds with it ever that's true that's
true I would like to at some point I
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely need to make an effort to get
that cut back in the rotation but yeah if
[SPEAKER_03]: you look around you don't see any crosses
with it part of that might be because I
[SPEAKER_03]: think people wonder that if you put Jack
into something is anyone gonna want it and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's weird a lot of breeding is done with
that kind of intention like what is the
[SPEAKER_03]: market gonna want and for years you know I
mean even even before I started you know
[SPEAKER_03]: offering seeds publicly I just bred
whatever I wanted I didn't really think
[SPEAKER_03]: about what people wanted I thought about
what what I wanted to see and I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that's why I bred the stuff that
I've made like has nothing that had
[SPEAKER_03]: literally zero consideration for the
market at all you know but I learned I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean it's easy to see like what people
want and what they don't want but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a plant like the J1 just if you
tell people there's Jack in something
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in the Bay Area the face
they're gonna make is not is not one of
[SPEAKER_02]: approval well that's almost like a bit of
a good little segue so if we loop back to
[SPEAKER_02]: you were talking about how you'd started
smoking what was the progression like and
[SPEAKER_03]: the transition from say a smoker to grower
for you yeah so I started smoking floor
[SPEAKER_03]: and I grew up in Florida it's a pretty
difficult state to operate and I think you
[SPEAKER_03]: know you find a lot of people in this
especially on the West Coast that were
[SPEAKER_03]: from Florida because you had to have a
real passion for it and that's something
[SPEAKER_03]: that doesn't get tamped out I mean at the
time I was going to school in Gainesville
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was growing I it's a friend of mine
had started growing when he came back from
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam and when I saw it I'd seen a
setup before I didn't even know what it
[SPEAKER_03]: was when I saw it a friend of mine took me
to a friend's basement in Chicago and I
[SPEAKER_03]: went downstairs he you know he said hey
it's my guy he's cool whatever whatever he
[SPEAKER_03]: takes me downstairs and I see a makeshift
space I think it honestly I think it had
[SPEAKER_03]: to be like two by fours and some kind of
plastic it wasn't not anything fancy and
[SPEAKER_03]: he opens it up and I see a bulb in there
and some light and some plants and in
[SPEAKER_03]: retrospect now looking back I'm like yeah
they were they were pretty rough-looking
[SPEAKER_03]: but I didn't know the difference between a
metal halide and an HPS whatever it might
[SPEAKER_03]: be and I asked him kind of some questions
and he was actually making seeds in there
[SPEAKER_03]: he had a male in there and he was actually
making seeds which totally random that
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of surprised me but it kind of stuck
with me and it made me think like wow you
[SPEAKER_03]: could just you can just do this not having
ever seen anyone do it before it just I
[SPEAKER_03]: said yeah this is something that you could
do if you just had a little bit of space
[SPEAKER_03]: so when I got back to Florida I sold a
guitar and an amp that I had and I went
[SPEAKER_03]: and bought a 400-watt light and I set up a
space at a house that I was renting and I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember padlocking the door you know if
we would have some people over here and
[SPEAKER_03]: there and then somebody would say
something about the smell I would tell
[SPEAKER_03]: them oh you know we smoke we smoke a lot
of weed and they would inevitably say
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not what weed smoke smells like but
I remember setting up just a small closet
[SPEAKER_03]: space with a 400 and I got some cuttings
from a friend of mine I started growing
[SPEAKER_03]: them in there grew them and it actually
was some reclining Buddha by Soma at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time and I remember growing it and
somebody that I used to somebody I used to
[SPEAKER_03]: provide mentioned something about the
cherry flavor in the flower not knowing
[SPEAKER_03]: that I had grown it not knowing anything
about it supposedly having a cherry type
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor and I remember that really stuck
with me and it made me it made me think
[SPEAKER_03]: about all the different possibilities that
were that were out there and I was in
[SPEAKER_03]: school I didn't like it I did not enjoy
the whole school system to be honest I
[SPEAKER_03]: thought it was kind of a waste of time and
money and a money grab for the most part I
[SPEAKER_03]: think you know for certain professions it
makes sense but in general for all kids to
[SPEAKER_03]: go to school just doesn't really make a
lot of sense and so I was growing for
[SPEAKER_03]: about a year and a half out there and I
remember just it was you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: mandatory minimums at the time for any
kind of cultivation there so like a single
[SPEAKER_03]: plant was you know mandatory minimum I
think it was three to five years and at
[SPEAKER_03]: that point I had I had a friend who moved
to San Diego and so in talking with him
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know my family they basically said
like hey if you're gonna keep doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe you should just move out west so you
don't go to jail and I packed up I sold
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and I moved out west and gave
it a shot out there in San Diego that's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually where I got my first taste of
like real Southern California like high
[SPEAKER_03]: grade because I used to fly out there all
the time but like living out there and
[SPEAKER_03]: being out there was totally different you
really got to see what was happening and
[SPEAKER_03]: at the time there there was a medical
scene this was after 215 had passed and it
[SPEAKER_03]: was very very different what was happening
out there they had clubs but they were
[SPEAKER_03]: getting shut down and harassed San Diego
is a beautiful place but it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: conservative and not very very cannabis
friendly although there is a large scene
[SPEAKER_03]: there but that was where I first started
seeing things like the bull rider the p91
[SPEAKER_03]: the cat piss all that stuff and they grew
some they had some Afghani whatnot and I
[SPEAKER_03]: just remember seeing just the sheer volume
of flower that was coming out of the out
[SPEAKER_03]: of out of the area in general and it
really you know it stuck with me and so I
[SPEAKER_03]: had the chance to move out there I gave it
a go it didn't work out a friend of mine
[SPEAKER_03]: got addicted to Oxy's so that that kind of
went sideways I don't know how much people
[SPEAKER_03]: have spoken about that kind of stuff but
this business is not easy the lifestyle is
[SPEAKER_03]: not easy it's a lot you know you might see
people that people think are successful
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't think people know everything
they had to go through and how many times
[SPEAKER_03]: they had to try and how many times they
didn't quit before they were able to see
[SPEAKER_03]: some success I mean it's a tough business
and you know definitely that type of
[SPEAKER_03]: lifestyle at the time it's was not a
traditional lifestyle so you know
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely pills and whatnot and
everything were around and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: when Oxy's but I think we're starting to
get a hold on people out there so that
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't really work out I ended up leaving
everything moving back east working again
[SPEAKER_03]: saving some more money and then I was kind
of over it because I hadn't I hadn't been
[SPEAKER_03]: to NorCal I was kind of over it San Diego
just reminded me of LA and Miami crossed
[SPEAKER_03]: together and I said to do that I'll just
go back and live in Miami I like Miami and
[SPEAKER_03]: then some friends of mine were out in Lake
Tahoe and they invited me out for the
[SPEAKER_03]: summer to go visit out there they lived on
what I call perpetual hippie tour so they
[SPEAKER_03]: just you know work save money go on hippie
tour come back broke work save money same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing over and over again and I went out
there to Lake Tahoe and it was stunning it
[SPEAKER_03]: was beautiful I'd never seen anything like
it never seen anything like it I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know if you had the chance to get to Lake
Tahoe but it's beautiful stunning you know
[SPEAKER_03]: impactful and had a chance to go down to
Oakland with my friends and I remember
[SPEAKER_03]: being at somebody's house at a friend of
my friend's house and they had told him
[SPEAKER_03]: you know this is this is my guy been
friends for a long time so everything was
[SPEAKER_03]: fine with me and him but somebody came by
with a duffel bag and a bunch of perps a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of perp packs and which was you know
huge in the Bay Area at that time that was
[SPEAKER_03]: like around 2005 2006 and I remember them
you know doing whatever they were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: with the perp packs and then him pulling
out like a pound of purple keef and saying
[SPEAKER_03]: like I don't know what to do with this and
at that point that's when I chimed in and
[SPEAKER_03]: said you know well you know I'll take that
and he didn't know who I was he was
[SPEAKER_03]: completely thrown off by me the guy
sitting on the couch smoking not saying
[SPEAKER_03]: anything saying I'll take that and but it
just it was obvious to me at that point
[SPEAKER_03]: that like I was in the wrong place because
I'm in a city right now where people have
[SPEAKER_03]: a pound of purple keef and don't know what
to do with it I'd never seen a pound of
[SPEAKER_03]: purple keef anywhere like so it blew my
mind that I was like yeah I'm coming back
[SPEAKER_03]: to Oakland and so you know I went home I
worked saved more money sold everything I
[SPEAKER_03]: owned and rented a warehouse off
Craigslist not had not having ever seen it
[SPEAKER_03]: and just moved out with two duffel bags
and you know bought some lights and got to
[SPEAKER_03]: work out there and kind of built up from
there I mean it definitely you know it
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't was not easy to give it a run I
don't know if you if you spent any time in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oakland Oakland is getting gentrified now
it's a lot more cleaned up as it were but
[SPEAKER_03]: still a rough city and still you know but
a place a place that lives eats and sleeps
[SPEAKER_03]: high-grade cannabis in my opinion I know
my friends in SoCal might differ but I
[SPEAKER_03]: think I think the Bay Area is the
epicenter of global cannabis not even not
[SPEAKER_03]: even you know just in California but
globally and no knock on you know Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever the Emerald Triangle all that
stuff they do their thing up there but if
[SPEAKER_03]: you really really look at who's been
making the waves over the last decade it's
[SPEAKER_03]: the Bay Area and if anyone has any claim
before that it's SoCal you know with the
[SPEAKER_03]: OGs but since then it's been all the Bay
Area I mean all of it you know the cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: the gelatos the sherbs everything all this
stuff it's just been Bay Area Bay Area Bay
[SPEAKER_03]: Area for you know probably the last seven
or eight years maybe ten years yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred percent I mean there's there's so
many things we can touch on there the
[SPEAKER_02]: first thing I wanted to do before we move
past it you mentioned the bull rider the
[SPEAKER_02]: P-91 and the cat pierced down in San Diego
sounds like you were down there when Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: was kind of doing his thing Matt Riot were
you familiar with him at all or not really
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not I avoided any kind of social
interaction possible with people that were
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of my circle I think it's a big
reason why I've managed to kind of stay
[SPEAKER_03]: out of trouble a lot of these guys have
had run-ins or had you know people snitch
[SPEAKER_03]: on them or whatever it might be or get
robbed and I pretty much avoided everyone
[SPEAKER_03]: I was connected with one circle of people
out there that had access to all of those
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers they were born and raised in San
Diego so all those guys you know had gone
[SPEAKER_03]: to school there and so they you know they
all they all had the local connections for
[SPEAKER_03]: those flowers and a lot of those flowers I
mean you don't see them anymore like
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere and even the bull rider it fell
off years and years later I know people
[SPEAKER_03]: are out there now saying that they still
have it and grow it I'd like to see it to
[SPEAKER_03]: see if it is what it is I almost think at
this point you could just tell people it's
[SPEAKER_03]: bull rider and them having never seen it
they wouldn't know the difference because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just some Afghani right yes
supposedly you know not having been there
[SPEAKER_03]: for it that's my understanding of it and
you know it didn't have the best bag of
[SPEAKER_03]: peel or anything it was big flowers you
could tell it yielded and there was also
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a super silver haze that was
being grown out there in Long Beach at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time too that was phenomenal I mean
ridiculous and there was a Cali mist and I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean I kind of missed those days there was
some flower that you couldn't buy like
[SPEAKER_03]: there was such a limited amount it was
already spoken for people would prepay for
[SPEAKER_03]: the flower which is something that I don't
know that if young people even like would
[SPEAKER_03]: understand what that is like they would
prepay before the harvest so that they
[SPEAKER_03]: could have their their share of that
harvest and there was a super silver haze
[SPEAKER_03]: that was like that and the guy that I knew
who would get it he wouldn't sell any of
[SPEAKER_03]: it he would only trade me so I'd have to
trade him like that's that the super
[SPEAKER_03]: silver haze let's say that I would get for
the Cali mist that he was getting and it
[SPEAKER_03]: was just like a one-to-one trade that was
it like as much as I was willing to give
[SPEAKER_03]: up that's as much as he was willing to
give up and it was um you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: different there was just there was more
limited limited flower out there at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time but you know I didn't I didn't know
Matt yeah seems like he he seems like he
[SPEAKER_03]: was more social I mean definitely I think
he was into like the punk rock scene and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot so he was definitely out there I
was hanging out with Jamaicans and a
[SPEAKER_03]: totally different type of scene in like
Mission Beach and PB out there yeah cool
[SPEAKER_02]: okay and so then what was your transition
from going as just a grower to then
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to make your own seeds yeah so so
we were on IC mag a bunch of us and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I had tried to buy seeds years ago
off like heaven stairway or something they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't make it I freaked out I was in
Florida at the time I said I'm not buying
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else through the mail I'm over it
and then I knew people that were buying
[SPEAKER_03]: off off IC mag off seed bay and seed
boutique and so I said you know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: said I'm gonna I'm gonna start getting
some seeds and I started just collecting
[SPEAKER_03]: some seeds and sending some money orders
here and there and grabbing some stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually the first thing I ever tried to
do was I took a mail from a pack of so
[SPEAKER_03]: much reclining Buddha and tried to hit a
bunch of things but I learned a valuable
[SPEAKER_03]: lesson from that in that like at all
everything that I grew from that was
[SPEAKER_03]: terrible it was all trash and I did it to
my bubble jack the East Coast sour and a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple other things and they were just
trash it was nothing good came from that
[SPEAKER_03]: mail and so I chucked all those seeds
whatever whatever with that and then some
[SPEAKER_03]: friends of mine were doing a lot of
outdoor work and you know we were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about like how the blue dream would go
deep into November it was a great plant
[SPEAKER_03]: for outdoor cultivation but they wanted
something that would finish faster and I
[SPEAKER_03]: had some Williams wonder from reef and so
we popped those found a mail and hit the
[SPEAKER_03]: blue dream with that because we figured
all right this is gonna be a plant that is
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna this is really gonna be a phenomenal
plant for outdoor cultivation it should
[SPEAKER_03]: finish faster from the Afghani influence
it should still be resinous it should
[SPEAKER_03]: still you know be real chunky hopefully
pick up some resistance to PM and betray
[SPEAKER_03]: this and whatever it might be so we
started that project and that's something
[SPEAKER_03]: we worked on over a couple of years just
kind of in our own world nothing to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with any kind of thoughts towards vending
seeds or seed company or anything it was
[SPEAKER_03]: just something that we worked on
collaboratively as a group and so we
[SPEAKER_03]: worked that for a couple of generations
and that's where that wet dream plant came
[SPEAKER_03]: from and that was my first like
realization like okay like yeah you can
[SPEAKER_03]: use a mail but they're definitely not all
the same and it doesn't matter what kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of female you cross it to if the mail is
trash like the work that comes from that
[SPEAKER_03]: is gonna be trash so we got we got lucky
you know we got lucky and the mail that we
[SPEAKER_03]: used was really solid and from there you
know we did one further selection and then
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done a couple of open open population
since then just to kind of spread it out
[SPEAKER_03]: and see see what kind of variance we might
find in there and not not bottleneck the
[SPEAKER_03]: gene pool so that's you know that was
probably the first actual breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: projects that we did as a group was just a
couple of friends with just an intention
[SPEAKER_03]: to breed something that would do better
and finish faster and at the time we
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't even really doing the depths it
was all just the larger full season plants
[SPEAKER_03]: so we just wanted something that would
still you know throw down big plants but
[SPEAKER_02]: finish quicker and what was your
impressions of the Williams Wanda strain
[SPEAKER_02]: that's something we frequently reminisce
about on the show yeah so I we loved it
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the when when I was living in
Chicago for a while I was staying out
[SPEAKER_03]: there for a little bit and the packs that
we would get were the willies is what we
[SPEAKER_03]: used to call them and they were coming out
of Oregon at the time which my
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding is like that's where that
variety was developed and I loved it I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean beautiful like electric green
resinous flowers large like nowadays you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it would be hard it would be hard to
really find something comparable to it but
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know a lot of what's popular
now is like the candy stuff and the fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet stuff or whatever it might be
there's like a real hashy plant but potent
[SPEAKER_03]: you know potent like the high from it was
was what we really really enjoyed it's
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful beautiful flower and that's
something that I mean you just you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: see it around anymore there's like I mean
I imagine it might still exist somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: like I think it's back then I've talked
about it there's usually someone in the
[SPEAKER_03]: hill somewhere holding something but they
don't talk to anyone and so you probably
[SPEAKER_03]: never see it but that's that's a really
old plant that I just don't think that you
[SPEAKER_03]: see anything like that anywhere else
anymore yeah certainly it seems like
[SPEAKER_02]: people are kind of madly looking for any
remnants of it so for the next little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of chat I wanted to touch on something
which I think everyone will be really
[SPEAKER_02]: interested to hear the story about which
probably a lot of people aren't actually
[SPEAKER_02]: aware that you were the person who found
the forum cut that's true would you be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to give us the backstory on that one
yeah absolutely yeah people have asked for
[SPEAKER_03]: years I've just never like I said you know
I never really wanted any attention for
[SPEAKER_03]: anything so I mean I think people have
people have said that profit was the one
[SPEAKER_03]: that gave it out and or my other buddy
frostboss both of them have probably been
[SPEAKER_03]: both of them have probably been involved
in like the actual story more than myself
[SPEAKER_03]: publicly so what happened there was we
used to have a get-together party and I
[SPEAKER_03]: see mag party in Vegas there was just kind
of just for a bunch of us together like
[SPEAKER_03]: invite only we would like rent a house and
get out there and whatnot I I had tried to
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid as much as humanly possible going to
any of these events just because why do I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be in a building with a bunch of
growers so I had tried to avoid it for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while but one of our friends had got into
some legal trouble and I had helped him
[SPEAKER_03]: out when he got popped and they took all
his plants I always have extra like just I
[SPEAKER_03]: always have an excessive amount of veg
plants because you just never know when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna need them and if you need
them I'd rather have them you can always
[SPEAKER_03]: chop them down you can always do whatever
with them but you at least have them on
[SPEAKER_03]: deck so when when our friend had gotten
trouble and they cut down his garden
[SPEAKER_03]: taking all his plants and whatnot I knew
when he got out he was gonna need some
[SPEAKER_03]: help and so I hit him up and just asked if
he wanted anything I could help him out
[SPEAKER_03]: and so I got him some plants got him
replugged and he said to me you know we
[SPEAKER_03]: have this party in Vegas you should really
come out I hadn't really wanted to go out
[SPEAKER_03]: but he talked me into it so I ended up
going out and I met frostboss and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think profit profit was there that year
for the first one but I met frostboss and
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember hanging out with him and you
know we were both from the bay and he had
[SPEAKER_03]: told me about something called cookies he
said yeah man there's something called
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies have you heard of it and I said no
I never heard of it he said aw man it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it's you know it's special man you should
check it out and I was like yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever whatever because I was growing
nothing but sour and OGs at that time I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't really have any interest I mean
sour and OG had reigned supreme for so
[SPEAKER_03]: long that why would I be interested in
anything else to be honest like I'd seen a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people come with other flower none
of it you know exceeded the sours of the
[SPEAKER_03]: OGs so what what was the point but he had
told me about something called cookies and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot and so when we got back he came by
my house one day and in his pocket he had
[SPEAKER_03]: a little smashed up nugget inside a
ziplock bag like a tiny tiny little point
[SPEAKER_03]: three point four nugget and it was abused
it didn't really look that great it had
[SPEAKER_03]: some purple color to it and whatnot I
didn't think much of it I broke it up
[SPEAKER_03]: though I ground it up and I put it in my
volcano and so I've been vaporizing for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time I do it mostly because of the
health benefit but also because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly the most flavorful way to
experience flower in my opinion if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just about the terpene profile if you
really just want to know what it tastes
[SPEAKER_03]: like you know that's gonna be the best way
to get that full experience so I ground it
[SPEAKER_03]: up I stuck it in the volcano I vaped it
and instantly I kind of I got what he was
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about and I started asking around
he knew the people he's familiar and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know he knows all he knows that whole
circle he's from SF but he didn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: access to the cut and so as I asked and he
said yeah we can get it we should get it
[SPEAKER_03]: and so I asked a couple of friends of mine
who were actually one of them was the same
[SPEAKER_03]: person that I worked with on the wet dream
and they didn't even know what I was
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about they had no clue so I said
specifically I said it's something called
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies this that and the other ask around
and see see if you can find it he asked a
[SPEAKER_03]: friend of ours he didn't know what it was
that friend actually asked another person
[SPEAKER_03]: that they knew who ran a hydro store in
the Emeryville area and he was married to
[SPEAKER_03]: an Asian girl whose family ran a grow spot
somewhere in that area it turned out that
[SPEAKER_03]: although he didn't have it they did and we
asked about it and they said oh you know
[SPEAKER_03]: we need we need like six grand or five
grand or whatever it was at that time and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know we kind of I think we all just
kind of looked at each other like ah you
[SPEAKER_03]: know is it really is it worth it I mean
that's that that you know it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: money for a cut especially at that time
and we decided that it was and he
[SPEAKER_03]: basically said he could get a lower price
if you know if we gave him a cut so they
[SPEAKER_03]: gave us one plant he took a cutting off of
it my other friend who put it together
[SPEAKER_03]: took a cutting off it and my friend who
had who had kind of put the whole thing
[SPEAKER_03]: together through these other people he
didn't have a place to keep it so he gave
[SPEAKER_03]: it to me and said hey hold on to it
because he knows if you give it to me I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna hold on to it and so I remember
getting it and ramping it up and posting
[SPEAKER_03]: about it actually on IC mag at the time
it's probably the first post about cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: like ever publicly and I remember posting
about it and just saying hey I got this
[SPEAKER_03]: girl's got cookies blah blah blah whatever
grew it you know started growing it out
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot and it you know showed my buddy
Frost boss and profit the samples of it
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's cookies and so we had it at
that time and what happened was I had a
[SPEAKER_03]: small get-together at my house and I gave
a cutting to four different people my
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy frost boss got a cutting profit got
a cutting and two other people that were
[SPEAKER_03]: there got cuttings and at that point I
didn't pass it with any restrictions I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't say you can't sell it I gave it to
them for free I didn't think they were
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna sell it I didn't really see what you
know what they would I didn't think that
[SPEAKER_03]: it would end up going the way that it did
and what ended up happening was yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: people started hitting them up to buy the
cuts people came up from LA people came
[SPEAKER_03]: from all over the place cuttings went to a
couple different people from there and
[SPEAKER_03]: then cuttings made it all the way to the
UK I know IC mag people out there got it
[SPEAKER_03]: got it through people that we know out
here and it just kind of it just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: went off I mean it got to the point where
when people were typing Girl Scout cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: in the search engine the IC mag thread was
coming up which is why they made us rename
[SPEAKER_03]: it so we weren't allowed to type Girl
Scout cookies anymore we had to type GSC
[SPEAKER_03]: and at that point is when people started
calling it the forum cut and it started
[SPEAKER_03]: because people outside the board and
people amongst the board started getting
[SPEAKER_03]: it and it really just spread like wildfire
I mean then I think animal came animal
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't a thing at that time and you know
our buddy straight flame he would have
[SPEAKER_03]: some insight into this but in my circle
with with these guys animal didn't exist
[SPEAKER_03]: there was just cookies and as far as we
knew that was it I didn't there wasn't the
[SPEAKER_03]: word thin mint the word platinum none of
that had ever been uttered there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: there was no differentiation it was just
cookies and I think at that time is when
[SPEAKER_03]: like it started to kind of gain popularity
and part of it I think part of the reason
[SPEAKER_03]: why I think it did gain the popularity is
because it got out so much I think if it
[SPEAKER_03]: hadn't got out nobody would ever really
seen it you know it would have been it
[SPEAKER_03]: would have been some of the nicest herb
nobody ever got to try and to be honest
[SPEAKER_03]: like the packs that they were growing were
not very good like the Asian packs and the
[SPEAKER_03]: packs from the guys in the city were not
really the greatest examples of cookies I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it really took it getting into the
hands of some people who actually cared
[SPEAKER_03]: about cultivating better flour and once
once people really put a lot of intent
[SPEAKER_03]: into it they saw like wow you know this is
some really there's some really high-grade
[SPEAKER_03]: flour it's beautiful you know stunning
totally different than anything we were
[SPEAKER_03]: growing at the time and some of the first
cookie packs to get to the green door came
[SPEAKER_03]: out of my garden and I remember going in
there one day after I've been vending
[SPEAKER_03]: cookie packs to them for a while and
seeing like they had like platinum cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: and I said what's what's platinum cookies
and they said oh that's that's your
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies we just we just renamed it because
there's other cookie packs now coming that
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't as good so they started putting
like regular cookies there and then
[SPEAKER_03]: platinum cookies and then from there came
like thin mint and this and that and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think the cookie guys even came out and
said that it wasn't real cookies but if
[SPEAKER_03]: you ask around now like globally speaking
if people know cookies it's it's that cut
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever whatever you know people people I
think it's kind of one of those things
[SPEAKER_03]: where people might have forum and they
might say oh it's been meant or it might
[SPEAKER_03]: be this or it might be that I know that
there was a different group in LA that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spoken with some friends of my
friends down there that had a cookie cut
[SPEAKER_03]: around the same time and so around that
like oh nine oh ten kind of area or yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: basically right around there is when
people started popping up with some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these other ones but there really wasn't
any differentiation at all an animal
[SPEAKER_03]: became a thing I mean I saw the animal
from my buddy frostboss that's who I got
[SPEAKER_03]: the cut from and we ran them side by side
they were a little bit different but I
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly think that I think there was just
a bunch of s ones of whatever like
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever or a bunch of fem seeds that that
forum probably came from and that all the
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies probably came from because if
you've noticed there's never been a cookie
[SPEAKER_03]: mail ever ever like and if you would think
if you had the most pop one of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: popular strains in the last 20 years you
would be capitalizing on that by by
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding with the mail but it doesn't
exist that I've ever seen and it's been a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time since since that plants been out
so that's you know I think that's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: the majority of the story besides the fact
you know that there was all kinds of all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of crazy things going on with that
cut I mean there was it got to the point
[SPEAKER_03]: where it was it was just everywhere and
that honestly like I've never really said
[SPEAKER_03]: anything about it but that's something
that kind of sat with me a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: poorly was that people started using the
term like whoring it out and I didn't like
[SPEAKER_03]: that because I felt like it was
disrespectful I mean it's something that
[SPEAKER_03]: we put out for free I put it out for free
you know we paid for it and we put it out
[SPEAKER_03]: for free and so for people to kind of like
treat it like that kind of left a salty
[SPEAKER_03]: taste in my mouth I think it's why I
really haven't been a proponent of passing
[SPEAKER_03]: out a lot of cuts I'm very very selective
now about wearing who I pass cuts to and I
[SPEAKER_03]: learned a lot from that because I think
also you started seeing a lot of poor
[SPEAKER_03]: examples of the flower and that that goes
down to one of my one of my one of my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite hashtags I don't use that much
but it's basically stop stop giving shitty
[SPEAKER_03]: growers good cuts because they make it
look bad somebody sees an example of it
[SPEAKER_03]: and then says oh well you know I've had
cookies and it's not that good no you just
[SPEAKER_03]: had a shitty example of it it's it's
proper like grown right it's beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: flower and it's look at the staying power
I mean it's been it's the most significant
[SPEAKER_03]: variety since og and I challenge anyone to
point out another variety it's not perps
[SPEAKER_03]: either I mean I love the perps and it was
big in the Bay Area but it never went
[SPEAKER_03]: national it never went global like it's a
Bay Area thing you know nobody in New York
[SPEAKER_03]: was asking for perps like people did want
cookies no that's that's a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: recount so I think the first thing I'd
want to follow up with is I'd always
[SPEAKER_02]: assumed that the forum cut was just like
an s1 of thin mint do you feel that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe not the case or what do you think
was the original Girl Scout cut that the
[SPEAKER_03]: cookie fam had yeah so I don't I don't
think so I think that if anything probably
[SPEAKER_03]: in those like they had they had and so
frost boss I've spoken to him a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: about it there there were some seated
packs back back then and he even he worked
[SPEAKER_03]: like deceiting some of these packs and we
think that that's where the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies like seeds came from because I
think what happened was that there was I
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always said I could be wrong and this
is one of those things where I'd love to
[SPEAKER_03]: see I'd love to see it if I'm wrong or if
I'm not but at the time you know the the
[SPEAKER_03]: og's and the cherry pie were like what was
really really popular in the Bay and a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people had those in their gardens and
everybody knows that the cherry pie is
[SPEAKER_03]: unstable and whenever I've looked at the
cookies that's what I see I see cherry pie
[SPEAKER_03]: and og like I see it I see it in the
structure I see it in the color I see it
[SPEAKER_03]: in the flavor I see it in the profile like
all of the above like that's that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen to me I think that there was you
know an accidental pollination and they
[SPEAKER_03]: grew some of the seeds out and that's
probably where their cookie cut came from
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine that the forum cut came out of
that same pack of seeds let's say as it
[SPEAKER_03]: were out of those same packs and that they
just grew it themselves independently and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where we got that cut from I could
be wrong but like I said there would the
[SPEAKER_03]: word thin mint had never got uttered like
that word did not exist like that that
[SPEAKER_03]: like that description of a specific
cutting was not a thing like my buddy
[SPEAKER_03]: frostboss never said oh there's this thin
mint or there's this platinum it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies and after cookies came like animal
and that was it like it was cookies and
[SPEAKER_03]: then animal and then I started hearing
people talk about thin mint and all this
[SPEAKER_03]: other stuff I think that may have been a
reaction on their part to try and say hey
[SPEAKER_03]: we have something that's not what everyone
else has it's not the cut that's going
[SPEAKER_03]: around we have thin mint cookies and
that's the cookie fam version of it but I
[SPEAKER_03]: could be wrong you know I would love to
hear their perspective on it if that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: case like you know one of the things that
does crack me up is when they talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: the breeding because if you bred it
where's the male?
[SPEAKER_03]: like and even if not what did you reverse
to make it happen they keep talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: oh it's this and F1 derb and blah blah
blah it's like I was in the bay there were
[SPEAKER_03]: people can say whatever they want to say
and I'd love to have my buddy straight
[SPEAKER_03]: flame clarify some points and he might I'd
never seen it you know and we've seen a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of flower and just the bay area is
very very tight like in terms of like
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening and who's growing what
like people know what's going around like
[SPEAKER_03]: we eat sleep and breathe it and so if
there was such a thing we would have heard
[SPEAKER_03]: about it it's not a thing like and if you
like I said if there was this F1 derb and
[SPEAKER_03]: you used it to make this you know
generational flower why not use it again
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah like where is it at?
[SPEAKER_02]: So with all that being said about the Girl
Scout cookies do you tend to try to avoid
[SPEAKER_02]: working with the forum cut now because it
is so widespread and used or is it just
[SPEAKER_02]: something you're not particularly
interested in working with or do you have
[SPEAKER_02]: plans for it in the future how do you see
the whole situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so I've actually have I bred with it
yeah you know I actually hit it once and I
[SPEAKER_03]: only made a few seeds with it I did a
forum with this with the Sherb but I've
[SPEAKER_03]: never actually grown I haven't grown them
out yet I mean I think initially when we
[SPEAKER_03]: first got it like I just I had such
respect for people breeding that I just
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't really feel like that was like the
thing to do was just to like run on it and
[SPEAKER_03]: just cash in on it and whatnot so just
avoided it and now I think generally I
[SPEAKER_03]: think I'm just more interested in other
types of work there's so much work that's
[SPEAKER_03]: similar to it now whether it's the
do-si-do and whatnot that I just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really see what I would do with it if
anything for me you know as a plant in of
[SPEAKER_03]: itself I appreciate it for breeding
purposes it's not really the direction
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm looking to go in one of the
things that really surprised me about it
[SPEAKER_03]: was you know we'd all been told and kind
of the common thought was that oh it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy poly hybrid and whatnot so you know
you're not it's not going to be stable
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not going to find anything good in
it it's actually incredibly dominant in a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the crosses like it really really
comes out in the crosses similar to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of how the do-si-do does the cookie the
cookies tend to really really shine
[SPEAKER_03]: through in a lot of these crosses so for
me it's not that I'm avoiding it I've
[SPEAKER_03]: actually thought about doing a fem project
with the forum I thought it might be fun
[SPEAKER_03]: there's just a lot of other stuff on the
plate that's kind of like looking forward
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think are more valuable you know in
terms of in terms of what I'm trying to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with my time so I as much as I love it I
think I would include it in some projects
[SPEAKER_03]: but not necessarily right now is like the
focus of what I'm trying to do I could see
[SPEAKER_03]: it being a part of something but not being
like the main piece in everything yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: okay and so how do you feel about cookies
in general not just the various cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: but like the brand and where they're
trying to take the whole image of it all I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean it's cool you know I see them I mean
there was clearly a split between I think
[SPEAKER_03]: like the like like Shrabinsky and all
those guys even amongst themselves and
[SPEAKER_03]: then burner with the cookies brand because
I think that's just burner that cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: brand and it's interesting what they've
done you know they've definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: capitalized on it I have nothing but
respect for being able to go out there and
[SPEAKER_03]: get a piece of something for themselves in
terms of like what it actually is like I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have a lot of interest in it in the
in and of itself me definitely can't knock
[SPEAKER_03]: the hustle though I see them out there you
know between burner with the stores or
[SPEAKER_03]: Shrabinsky doing his thing some of the
other guys they don't seem as active I
[SPEAKER_03]: think pie guy and Jigga maybe is a little
bit more active but I have no knock on it
[SPEAKER_03]: I've some of the work that I've seen
hasn't been great so I just kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: not really excited about it I mean I'm
sure you saw some of the work at Emerald
[SPEAKER_03]: Cup like there was definitely a lot of
people there that had work that was more
[SPEAKER_03]: impressive to me but as a brand I mean
there's no denying it they've they've
[SPEAKER_03]: crushed it you know it's a huge brand
globally recognized at this point and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know whichever one of them you know
whatever piece you're looking at they've
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely done something with it that I
think a lot of people whether they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: admit it or not a lot of people would have
liked him able to do they just weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: able to tie all the pieces together yeah
they have something yeah and they
[SPEAKER_02]: capitalized on it they've certainly done
some things well for sure but let's talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about what they could have done better
what do you think are some of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: they've fallen short on I honestly think
that if they had all stayed working
[SPEAKER_03]: together and not maybe and you know I
wasn't there so I don't know but usually
[SPEAKER_03]: in this business there's a lot of ego
people are used to being what I call king
[SPEAKER_03]: of their own castles you know they've all
had their own warehouses they've all had
[SPEAKER_03]: their own spots they're all used to being
their own bosses a lot of them have never
[SPEAKER_03]: worked for anybody else or even really
worked with anybody else in any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: significant capacity it's why so many of
these relationships fall apart in this
[SPEAKER_03]: business people don't know how to
communicate and set clear expectations
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not professional I honestly think
that there's companies on their way to
[SPEAKER_03]: billion dollar valuations right now and if
they had all figured out a way to work
[SPEAKER_03]: together they would be on their way to
doing that and you know I can't knock
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone I would have loved I would love to
see anybody from the underground make it
[SPEAKER_03]: to a billion dollar valuation one day and
if anybody could have done it it would
[SPEAKER_03]: have been them I think that's probably the
biggest thing because it kind of seems
[SPEAKER_03]: like burner just ran with it and he was
really like the least influential person I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean he was working at the Hemp Center as
like a security guard if I remember
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly and kind of just like made the
rap thing work and promoted it and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know hustle hustle hustle then definitely
did a lot I'm sure no knock click to be
[SPEAKER_03]: clear no knock on his hustle I'm sure he
busted his ass to get where he is right
[SPEAKER_03]: now because a lot of people were in the
day at that time a lot of people have the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity but I like I said I think the
biggest thing is I mean there's been you
[SPEAKER_03]: know fallouts between those people and so
I think that's probably the biggest thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of set them but set them back
and kept them from fulfilling their
[SPEAKER_03]: potential I think if they'd all been able
to just work together they would have
[SPEAKER_02]: really achieved something special yeah
definitely so something I have been
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in myself and I can't really
find a good answer is was Shabinsky a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the original crew it always felt to me
like he came in after they found the Girl
[SPEAKER_02]: Scouts and then had his little moment in
there what's your take on all that where
[SPEAKER_03]: does he fit in the picture for you yeah I
think I mean I'm pretty sure they were all
[SPEAKER_03]: friends because I think it's Pi Guy Jigga
and Sherb and I think I think they were
[SPEAKER_03]: all friends you know in SF especially it's
like it's kind of a like loose-knit but
[SPEAKER_03]: very very affiliated city like people
there's a lot of people that have grown up
[SPEAKER_03]: out there they know each other you know
they're friends with friends or you know
[SPEAKER_03]: they dated each other's cousins or
whatever it might be like people people
[SPEAKER_03]: have deep deep roots in that city and it's
a very very small area and so you know
[SPEAKER_03]: whether he whether I don't I don't I doubt
there was even really an official you know
[SPEAKER_03]: there was an official anything I think
they all just knew each other and happened
[SPEAKER_03]: to be involved in some of this stuff and
they probably all played their part in it
[SPEAKER_03]: from my understanding you know it was the
three of them it was Pi Guy Sherbinski and
[SPEAKER_03]: Jigga that like were responsible for that
then from there you know the affiliation
[SPEAKER_03]: with burner who was like rapping at the
time and you know did a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: promoting and it's weird because people
will shout out burner it's like oh yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: thanks thanks to burner for the cookies or
whatever and it's like not really if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to thank anyone's probably one of
those three guys and if really if you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to thank someone you could thank us
because they didn't want that cut getting
[SPEAKER_03]: out they didn't want people growing it so
if people are growing it you could
[SPEAKER_02]: probably really thank us yeah no I
definitely agree on that point and that
[SPEAKER_02]: raises an interesting point in itself what
do you think about snowman the the last
[SPEAKER_02]: remaining cookie cut that they feel hasn't
gotten out yet that they're still keeping
[SPEAKER_03]: under lock and key yeah so I've actually
never seen it and I would love to see it I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's probably something that I'd
have to ask my buddy straight flame about
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he would definitely know more
about it and my buddy frostboss would know
[SPEAKER_03]: more about it I've never seen it you know
I've heard things about it but to be
[SPEAKER_03]: honest I'd be curious to know like is it
better than the Sherb is it better than
[SPEAKER_03]: any of the gelato's like is it better than
the cookies because a lot of that stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of treading in the same gene pool so
you know I just kind of feel like they're
[SPEAKER_03]: just on opposite ends of the cookie
spectrum I would love I mean if it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: a gasier version of the cookies that might
be interesting yeah so sorry I was just
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna say I spoke to shav 707 seed bank
and he's got an s1 of it because he
[SPEAKER_02]: managed to buy a bag off one of the guys
founds a seed in it and it's pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: s1 and he said it's just like a much more
og dominant version of cookies basically
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what I figured that's the only
other thing that it could be and I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember yeah that I was gonna say that I
thought there was an s1 somewhere but not
[SPEAKER_03]: I had never seen it so yeah I mean that
doesn't surprise me I think if you wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to do that though you know you could just
reverse an og to the cookies and you would
[SPEAKER_03]: have that I don't think that it's anything
you know I don't know I just I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's game-changing I mean does he sound
very very excited about that s1 or is it
[SPEAKER_03]: just something that he's like it's good
but neither here nor there he likes it for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure but I think that kind of touches on
the point you raised earlier in the you
[SPEAKER_02]: know at that point is it really that
different from dosy dough exactly yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah that's I mean that's that's exactly
my point like is it really anything so
[SPEAKER_03]: like if you had a male if you actually
bred the cookies hit it to something like
[SPEAKER_03]: a Vietnam hit it to something like a Burma
hit it to something like a Guatemalan hit
[SPEAKER_03]: it to something weird now now we've got
something you know like if you hit it to
[SPEAKER_03]: three different types of you know totally
different genetics and run through those I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's how you're gonna find
something different I mean if cookies is
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of what I think it is which is just
ogs and cherry pie what are you really
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that's that different like yeah you
know what's I mean what do you what do you
[SPEAKER_03]: really have if you're if you're just
hitting it back to an og my next question
[SPEAKER_02]: on the cookies would be I think you might
have a little bit of an idea but if you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't that's fine do you know much about
the story behind the og kb because what
[SPEAKER_02]: you find online is just that supposedly
the guy og kush breath just as like oh I
[SPEAKER_02]: just got given it as GSC but like I feel
like there's probably a bit more to it
[SPEAKER_03]: than that yeah so he's as far as I know I
don't think og kush breath has ever really
[SPEAKER_03]: spoken publicly about it so I definitely
wouldn't want to put words in his mouth I
[SPEAKER_03]: know nor Cal who is friends with him and
you know I know as much as nor Cal has
[SPEAKER_03]: told me and the story of where it came
from I can't speak to it I do know how how
[SPEAKER_03]: it got out I do know how it was given out
but where he got it from I can't say and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that he got it as a cutting I don't
think he popped it from seed so I believe
[SPEAKER_03]: that he got that as as a cutting and it
may have been from from that initial batch
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think most of these seeds came from
yeah because they're very similar you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what what people call the thin mint and
the animal and even the og kb you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: structure is completely mutated and
totally you know in that way it's
[SPEAKER_03]: different the bag appeal the frost like
the flavor profile is very very similar
[SPEAKER_03]: the style of the flower very very similar
I mean all I know about that is that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was given to nor Cal as a favor as a thank
you for a favor that he did for og kush
[SPEAKER_03]: breath and you know if he wants to speak
publicly about about what that was at some
[SPEAKER_03]: point he can but I'll say that he did a
favor for him and as a thank you he gave
[SPEAKER_03]: him that plant he nor Cal gave that plant
to several of us probably a half dozen of
[SPEAKER_03]: us nobody kept it I kept it nobody else
kept it because when we put it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: bedrooms it got lapped by everything else
when we sent it into flower it literally
[SPEAKER_03]: got drowned out I remember having to like
lift it up to get it like above the canopy
[SPEAKER_03]: where the sours were and everything else I
mean it couldn't keep up with form it
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't it couldn't keep up with anything
it veg super slow it didn't like to be
[SPEAKER_03]: overwatered it was slow to root nobody
liked it everyone let it go and it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: until probably about nine months or a year
later when it started kind of getting some
[SPEAKER_03]: traction that people started hitting us up
asking for it back and nor Cal's general
[SPEAKER_03]: response was well I've already gave it to
you once no no I'm not giving it to you
[SPEAKER_03]: again so a lot of people didn't get it
back and I think you know a couple people
[SPEAKER_03]: got it and it is out you know some people
have it but if you notice it's not one
[SPEAKER_03]: that people produce large amounts of
flower of it's not one that you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: you see commonly on a shelf and I have
seen certain producers in other states
[SPEAKER_03]: claim to have it and when I've seen the
flower in the store it's it's not the OG
[SPEAKER_03]: KB it's just not so I've never actually
seen it like commercially on a shelf
[SPEAKER_03]: probably because of how difficult it is to
grow and how long it takes but you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what's interesting is when you see it
cross with the with with the face off in
[SPEAKER_03]: the dosido it doesn't show that I mean it
shows some of the mutant tendencies and
[SPEAKER_03]: you see that in like a peanut butter
breaths and whatnot because it comes out a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot in there but there's generally good
plants to be found in there so it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: weird plant it's hard to pollinate I
actually made an OG KB SFV NL at one point
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've never run those seeds it didn't
make a lot of them it doesn't have a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of pistols and this is friendly piece of
advice if anybody does have it and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting pollinating it you're gonna
want to pollinate it way early and it just
[SPEAKER_03]: does not have a lot of pistols so it will
not make a lot of seeds it just it can't
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're gonna wanna you're gonna want
to adjust your feed you're gonna want to
[SPEAKER_03]: adjust your lighting and whatnot to make
it stretch a little bit more and make it a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit less dense so the seeds have
more time to fill in and yeah it's a it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a really interesting plant hard-pressed to
find an ounce of it honestly like only I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: really the only person I know still
growing it is Norcal and he most mostly
[SPEAKER_03]: for personal projects and whatnot things
that he's working on for himself but not
[SPEAKER_03]: really for commercial production at all
like I'm like I said I've never seen it
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it once on the shelf and it
wasn't what they said it was yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: I've certainly never been able to try it
unfortunately I would love to take a stab
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think I read somewhere I think
Norcal wrote somewhere the reason how he
[SPEAKER_02]: got that plant and maybe you can yay-nay
that for me or if you prefer not to that's
[SPEAKER_02]: fine but what I had heard was that OG
Kushbreath had like a grow somewhere and
[SPEAKER_02]: he was like about to be busted by the cops
or something and like Norcal went to the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow and like took it all down for him and
was like as he's doing it like the cops
[SPEAKER_02]: could bust in at any moment type thing so
very much in danger himself but he managed
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it and get it all packed up and so
it was given to him as like a thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: for that because that's obviously like a
pretty hectic situation is that roughly
[SPEAKER_02]: what happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: that is yeah that is exactly what happened
yeah it was a favor for breaking down a
[SPEAKER_03]: spot and like you said you know anything
could have happened at that time he was at
[SPEAKER_03]: risk of getting busted there and so as a
favor as a thank you for doing that for
[SPEAKER_03]: him he gave him that cut and that's you
know I know they've always had they've
[SPEAKER_03]: always had a good relationship over the
years the two of them so you know solid I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean Norcal is one of the most I'll put it
on record Norcal is one of the most solid
[SPEAKER_03]: guys you'll ever meet in this business
we've been friends for a long time a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time and very very stand-up guy good good
person yeah good to know good to know okay
[SPEAKER_02]: so my final question directly relating to
cookies for the moment is do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that there will be any repercussions on
the cookie fam for the whole candy rain
[SPEAKER_02]: debacle or do you think they're just gonna
slip by and nothing will ever really
[SPEAKER_02]: happen about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're gonna slip by and they're
gonna pop back up again and they're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: do something again and people are gonna
forget that this ever happened I mean you
[SPEAKER_03]: got to remember there's other people not
at their scale and not at that price point
[SPEAKER_03]: that have kind of had these issues and I'm
not gonna I don't want to say anybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: name or whatever if you know if you've
been in this you've seen there's a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of individuals specifically that it popped
up dropped a whole line had it be a
[SPEAKER_03]: disaster gone underground and popped up a
couple years later and tried again but the
[SPEAKER_03]: candy rain debacle I mean honestly people
are such fanboys that I don't even think
[SPEAKER_03]: they're mad if anything they they kind of
set the standard for him or hey you know
[SPEAKER_03]: if you find one that's good enough and I
mean those packs you know they were
[SPEAKER_03]: significant amount of money people lost a
lot of time and energy into those and
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly you know there was massive issues
with them and so I think people were just
[SPEAKER_03]: doubly upset the fact that I don't really
think they ever responded to it publicly I
[SPEAKER_03]: think they kind of just ignored it as far
as I know I think a big part of the candy
[SPEAKER_03]: rain debacle was yeah people spent a lot
of money and they couldn't even get them
[SPEAKER_02]: to germ but they don't want to say
anything yeah definitely and I mean a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of an insider scoop which may
or may not be publicly known but um JBZ
[SPEAKER_02]: has a hundred percent signed on to be
cookie fams in-house breeder from now on
[SPEAKER_02]: so we will certainly see some more stuff
from them in the near future yeah no I had
[SPEAKER_03]: heard about that yeah no congratulations
to him I hope they caught him a huge check
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly yeah so I'm like I said I'm not
mad at anyone getting out there getting it
[SPEAKER_03]: you know like good for them if you can get
them to cut you a huge check I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: easy for a lot of people to say oh I would
never do that until it's sitting in front
[SPEAKER_03]: of you and then would you do that I was
gonna just say there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: making making the transition into the
recreational cannabis market doing just
[SPEAKER_03]: that because they don't have the capital
they don't have the access to the property
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't have the connections so they're
gonna they're gonna sign on with someone
[SPEAKER_03]: who can who can take what they've built
and magnify it yeah definitely definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: and if and you know based on JBZ's work
like you know for the most part he does
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good stuff you know hopefully that
trend continues in terms of what he does
[SPEAKER_03]: for cookie fam yeah I don't see any reason
why it wouldn't I think I think honestly I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it I think it's gonna be good work
yeah hopefully okay well to get off
[SPEAKER_02]: something a little less doom and gloom I
do want to quickly run this by you how do
[SPEAKER_02]: you feel when you see like kind of I don't
want to say distant offspring but just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of offspring of the forum go on to
reach stardom like the one that comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: mind is he trace it back the GMOs got the
forum in it when you see that type of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing and all the traction it gets do you
get a certain sense of kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplishment from that or did you just
don't really think about it to be honest I
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really think about it much but but
I always felt like cannabis had done so
[SPEAKER_03]: much for me that there was really nothing
that I could ever do to repay it and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be blunt and say something that
people don't really seem to say like I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't believe in the cannabis community I
grew up where you know people sold drugs I
[SPEAKER_03]: grew up where people hustled like that's
why I've always like responded well to
[SPEAKER_03]: like Oakland and the type of mentality
that people have there it's a hustling
[SPEAKER_03]: mentality it doesn't matter what they're
doing they're they're trying and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to hustle survive and improve their
position and so cannabis had always done
[SPEAKER_03]: so so much for me I didn't ever really
think there was anything I could ever do
[SPEAKER_03]: to like to repay it in general like the I
don't want to say the community because I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't really believe in that but more more
just so like just the world that it
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivates around it the people that are
in the space the people that are in like
[SPEAKER_03]: tied into this plant and all the different
offshoots of it and so to see the forum
[SPEAKER_03]: cut get used in so many projects and just
really and like yeah and like you said to
[SPEAKER_03]: see the GMO blow up and a bunch of these
other cuts that have blown up because of
[SPEAKER_03]: it as well if anything like I'd say it
makes me a little bit happy because I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like I have the chance to contribute to
like changing the course of cannabis which
[SPEAKER_03]: how many people can really say that how
many people can really say that without
[SPEAKER_03]: this thing that they had done that that
they played a part you know in literally
[SPEAKER_03]: shifting the course of cannabis on a
global scale and you know with like you
[SPEAKER_03]: said without that cut making it to Europe
and Mamiko making those seeds and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: know skunk master flex selecting that cut
and you know it blowing up in Michigan
[SPEAKER_03]: before it ever blew up out here that was
one of the first cuts that actually you
[SPEAKER_03]: know in a long time that actually started
in the in the Midwest and came west a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple years later it wasn't you know it
was big there before it was really big out
[SPEAKER_03]: west so in a way I would say you know that
it stokes me because to know that that
[SPEAKER_03]: would not exist if we had not done what we
did even as far as getting the cut to
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe like if we hadn't done that Mamiko
would have never made the GMO and if he
[SPEAKER_03]: hadn't made the GMO then skunk master flex
you know they wouldn't have the Han Solo
[SPEAKER_03]: burger and all that other stuff that
they've done with that so when you really
[SPEAKER_03]: look at it I mean a lot of stuff when you
trace it back is from the forum I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: even Sin City seeds you know I want to say
if I'm not mistaken I want to say it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like blue power and forum and they use
that I think JBZ used that when they made
[SPEAKER_03]: the wedding cake and yeah so that also
would not exist without that I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of if you really really
trace it back it's kind it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: a horse or something where you say look at
all these look at all the offspring and
[SPEAKER_03]: all the all the all the different plants
that are related to it they can be traced
[SPEAKER_03]: back to it they wouldn't exist without it
I mean to me it kind of stokes me because
[SPEAKER_03]: really like how many people have actually
had a chance to contribute to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: scene at that level I mean you can talk
about chem dog you can talk about a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of these people you know that I mean they
were pivotal factors in in these plants
[SPEAKER_03]: you know getting to where they were going
you know bubba I mean the chems the bubbas
[SPEAKER_03]: even the sours you know all of that stuff
then I mean with the OGs you know you can
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about ghosts you know the ghost cut
and some of that stuff at LA I mean if
[SPEAKER_03]: that stuff hadn't really gone where it got
you know like a lot of the stuff from you
[SPEAKER_03]: know from archive wouldn't exist I mean
face-off and all that stuff from you know
[SPEAKER_03]: from those guys down in SoCal and then you
know the doctor working with that and just
[SPEAKER_03]: it's in it's I would say more than
anything I'm grateful to have had the
[SPEAKER_03]: chance to play a part in in this thing and
I think the biggest takeaway is like you
[SPEAKER_03]: are just a piece of this whole thing it's
not nobody in this business and in this
[SPEAKER_03]: scene or whatever you want to call it
exists independently of everybody else
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all connected to each other in some
way shape or form and some of us you know
[SPEAKER_03]: have bigger you know roles that we've
played more more has gone through us than
[SPEAKER_03]: other people more connections more
networks whatever it might be have
[SPEAKER_03]: spiraled out from these things that we've
done but without you know all these people
[SPEAKER_03]: it wouldn't exist I mean if I had just
given the cut to my if I just given the
[SPEAKER_03]: cut to my two or three friends and they
hadn't passed it out I wasn't gonna pass
[SPEAKER_03]: it out not because I had no interest in
passing it just because I or because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: against passing it just because I just
generally avoided talking to people like
[SPEAKER_03]: in this business no good comes from
talking to people so just the more that
[SPEAKER_03]: you avoid people the longer you'll survive
and that was kind of my feeling on that so
[SPEAKER_03]: if anything I would say that I'm honored
you know it's funny that the GMO is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually one of the only cuts I ever asked
for and they told me they said yes but
[SPEAKER_03]: they never got it to me and they kind of
just like left me on okay whatever so I
[SPEAKER_03]: thought that was kind of funny because
yeah that cut wouldn't exist without
[SPEAKER_03]: without the work that I had done I mean I
know true in the UK and in Spain has
[SPEAKER_03]: worked a lot with the forum as well he got
that you know directly from our circle I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean a lot of people can trace where that
cut came from back to people that were
[SPEAKER_03]: affiliated with us so yeah I would say if
anything you know I'm grateful and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: honored you know to have been able to
shift cannabis in some way shape or form
[SPEAKER_02]: to have even been a part of it yeah what a
really awesome sentiment to express and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's so kind of coincidental you
referenced true I mean interviewing him in
[SPEAKER_02]: like 12 hours so there you go random nice
he's a cool guy I guess you vouch for him
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah yeah yeah he knows me from the forums
from back in the day he was affiliated
[SPEAKER_03]: with some of our friends and that's how he
got that forum cut which I'm sure you can
[SPEAKER_02]: ask him about cool you gave me another
question I love it but something you did
[SPEAKER_02]: mention which I you know fan favorite of
the show personal favorite of mine chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog let's talk about it the 91 the various
D's what are your experiences with the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog do you like it which one's your
favorite give me the lowdown so I love the
[SPEAKER_03]: chem D the first chem I ever grew was the
four and it was you know bigger yielding
[SPEAKER_03]: you know real solid threw down really
really well but people kind of had got
[SPEAKER_03]: tired of it that's actually one that I'm
like bummed that I get I gave up I know
[SPEAKER_03]: some friends of ours in our circle still
have it so I could I could get that one
[SPEAKER_03]: back at some point but for whatever reason
it's been like like the least favorite at
[SPEAKER_03]: one out of all of them the D is phenomenal
and you know you talked about the GMO and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's really part of what makes it
special I mean the proper D well done is
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what what my what my boy calls
blunt weed or gangster weed it's like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: super potent incredibly tasty does not
does not have the best bag appeal in the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire world does not photograph super
well but is just amazing phenomenal herb
[SPEAKER_03]: just raunchy beautiful herb I mean it's
what makes the GMO like you know the GMO
[SPEAKER_03]: just got dressed up in a better in a
better bag necessarily or a better shell
[SPEAKER_03]: from the forum but really what really
makes it is the chem D and then the 91 is
[SPEAKER_03]: a beautiful plant the 91 and the D are
gorgeous plants in and of themselves the
[SPEAKER_03]: 91 being more OG which I just I just love
it I mean I think it's an amazing amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: plant as well and you know but they're
they're a little bit fickle the D the D
[SPEAKER_03]: will do better than ID one is a little bit
more fickle but I love them both I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're you know they're staples in
in the cannabis scene in my opinion and I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think that enough people have
actually seen like you said oh the various
[SPEAKER_03]: DS and yeah there's the non-variegated and
this one and the other one we were lucky
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to get the D cut from JJ separately
you know we had had it as well but you
[SPEAKER_03]: know when we when we got the one from JJ
we said okay well you know this one is
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely the one if there was any
question there's not a question anymore
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's a phenomenal plant beautiful love
it I mean if you've I mean you've tried
[SPEAKER_03]: the GMO I'm sure you've tried the D the
way that the profile sticks to your palate
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's really kind of like cuts
through anything else yeah very very
[SPEAKER_02]: special plant and this kind of like a nice
little segue onto the next question which
[SPEAKER_02]: is let's talk about a strain that I think
will become known as like the equivalent
[SPEAKER_02]: of the chem dogs but for kind of the 2010
to 2020 period the Mac you know it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: so used abused you know all the rest of it
what's your thoughts on it and do you plan
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with it because it's something I
noticed is surprisingly missing from your
[SPEAKER_03]: feed yeah so I got the Mac initially like
when when when people started kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: getting it I was pretty excited about it I
was like okay this thing I've heard good
[SPEAKER_03]: things it looks good I grew it and I just
wasn't impressed with it and I passed it
[SPEAKER_03]: to a couple of friends of mine you know
people who've been you know people who I
[SPEAKER_03]: have been my circle and I've shared cuts
with for a long time and we mostly all
[SPEAKER_03]: agreed except for one of us we mostly all
agreed that it's not that great it looks
[SPEAKER_03]: good it has nice bag appeal does not
really have much else going for it in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion I don't really care for the flavor
I don't care for the high I don't care for
[SPEAKER_03]: the growth habit I don't like it I mean I
think cap did a great job marketing and
[SPEAKER_03]: promoting and branding it I think he did I
think he did a phenomenal job by saying
[SPEAKER_03]: don't give this to people who haven't
earned it and in that way he kind of made
[SPEAKER_03]: it special I have seen a lot of the
crosses from it and so to answer your
[SPEAKER_03]: question I have seen a lot of the crosses
from it and they come out very very like
[SPEAKER_03]: what I would describe is that Jack Lemony
profile I think it's from the Colombian in
[SPEAKER_03]: it and that's not really something that I
necessarily need to look for or would want
[SPEAKER_03]: to look for and it seems very very
dominant in a lot of the crosses so for me
[SPEAKER_03]: not really something that I intend to work
with I did make I think I made some mac
[SPEAKER_03]: sherb seeds but I have not popped them and
I don't really think I have any intention
[SPEAKER_03]: to pop them at some point I guess if one
of my friends wanted them I'd probably let
[SPEAKER_03]: them run it but from what I've seen it's
not really a direction that I want to go
[SPEAKER_03]: down so I actually have a pack of the Mac
that I bought you know in all honesty from
[SPEAKER_03]: the first drop but it's one that you know
I don't think it's gonna stand up I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's you know gonna disappear pretty
quickly I mean if you've noticed like
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not really a lot of hype left
around it right now although it's crazy at
[SPEAKER_03]: the events when when cap is there the line
is like a hundred people deep or 200
[SPEAKER_03]: people deep for it so all the crosses and
this that and the other so I'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: interested to see you know one of my
friends does love it I mean he he told me
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm wrong flat out he said it's he
said he likes it but for me no I've got no
[SPEAKER_03]: interest in it and it's mostly just
everything that I described about how it
[SPEAKER_03]: breeds and the effect and the high and the
taste all of the above beautiful plant
[SPEAKER_03]: though photographs extremely well like a
great Instagram plant if you asked me yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that and the thing
about the Mac which I mean it has been
[SPEAKER_02]: said before but I bring it up again is it
frustrates me how no one's talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that no other serious legitimate
contender keeper cuts have ever been found
[SPEAKER_02]: from the seeds it's like it's almost like
the Mac one pulled out of the aether and
[SPEAKER_02]: then the seeds that are produced are
almost different because there's yet no
[SPEAKER_03]: one has ever found a keeper especially a
male no nothing that I have seen come out
[SPEAKER_03]: of those out of the crosses that have been
like you know the the authorized kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses that he's done as well as some of
the work that other people have done
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing has ever made any waves in
anybody's garden and so I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of there was a lot of hype
around it but just kind of looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: what's come from it it makes me think that
it's not really a it's not really a
[SPEAKER_03]: direction I would ever want to go in like
I wouldn't I wouldn't want to work it I
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't want to sell it to people I just
I have no interest in going down that road
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be interested to see if he keeps
working with it you know I don't know if
[SPEAKER_03]: he's on to something else perhaps he is
but yeah not like you said nothing has
[SPEAKER_03]: really come from those seeds and you would
think like I mean you know that can't the
[SPEAKER_03]: same cannot be said for Jay Beese's work
like there's been a ton of work that that
[SPEAKER_03]: people have found there's been a ton of
crosses the ice cream cake whatever all
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff that has come out since you
know since the wedding cake stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: people are you know people are like yeah
man this is really nice work I mean we
[SPEAKER_03]: have a wedding cake sherb that I made
that's phenomenal I mean it's beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: it's gorgeous like you know it was hard to
pick a keeper out of those out of those
[SPEAKER_03]: wedding cake sherb seeds that we made and
ran like there was a bunch of them that
[SPEAKER_03]: were just beautiful and I think that if I
did the same thing with the Mac I think I
[SPEAKER_02]: probably would have killed them all so
let's let's jump back to those sunset
[SPEAKER_02]: sherb crosses for a minute when you test
those crosses do you find that this show
[SPEAKER_02]: tends to be quite dominating or it more
lets the other parent shine through so
[SPEAKER_03]: that so one of the things that I've done
with which some of my friends have
[SPEAKER_03]: disagreed with is I tend to make a lot of
crosses sometimes and even if I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: release them or post them or whatever it
might be I I like to do it and the reason
[SPEAKER_03]: is because I've noticed that when
something so somebody might say oh the
[SPEAKER_03]: sherb is dominant and that may be the case
but there are pairings where it is not and
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that things are universally
dominant so I don't think that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: reverse a sherb let's say and hit you know
20 different clones that they're that the
[SPEAKER_03]: sherb is always going to be dominant
there's ones where it shines out and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's ones where it kind of fades back
and I've noticed that in some different
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses we did a daigle walker to the UW
and then we did the sherb to the UW and
[SPEAKER_03]: the daigle walker to the UW the daigle was
dominant and we did the sherb to the UW
[SPEAKER_03]: and the UW was dominant and so you know
they both had the same UW cut they had
[SPEAKER_03]: different donor parents as it were and
both of them responded differently to it
[SPEAKER_03]: so you know with the sherb crosses I mean
what we see in like the wedding cake
[SPEAKER_03]: sherbs is that there are some that are
wedding cake there are some that are sherb
[SPEAKER_03]: and there are some that are 50-50 and I'd
probably put them at about you know 40%
[SPEAKER_03]: one way 40% the other and 20% down the
middle and the 50-50 ones are the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm always most interested in the
ones that are more wedding cake or more
[SPEAKER_03]: sherb why would I select that way if I
already have those cuttings so it just
[SPEAKER_03]: makes sense to me to try and find some
thing where it pairs well in the case of
[SPEAKER_03]: the UW daigle we did select towards the
daigle only because that grapefruit
[SPEAKER_03]: profile is something I really like and it
just was kind of a finicky less like lower
[SPEAKER_03]: yielding plant whereas the UW just throws
down these you know big fat resinous colas
[SPEAKER_03]: on it and it's just you know it's hardy
and chunky and you know veggies well and
[SPEAKER_03]: so selecting one like that with that
grapefruit profile you know was a real
[SPEAKER_02]: real improvement for us yeah okay well I
mean heck speaking of sherbet and
[SPEAKER_02]: grapefruit this seems like a really good
time to ask in the past we had heard
[SPEAKER_02]: stories that it was possible that the
skittles cut was just a sherbet s1 now
[SPEAKER_02]: given your experience with sherbet do you
think there's any possibility that could
[SPEAKER_03]: be true um I mean no I don't think so and
and the reason is because we have you know
[SPEAKER_03]: run a lot of sherb and we've run a lot of
sherb crosses and I don't think that the
[SPEAKER_03]: skittles came from that I haven't really I
can't say that I really thought much ever
[SPEAKER_03]: about about where the skittles actually
came from I mean it was such a weird wonky
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that I never really had a lot of
interest in it and I know it made a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: waves as well and people were really
interested in it but it kind of reminds me
[SPEAKER_03]: of the lemon tree in a way where it's like
this is not something that like is like
[SPEAKER_03]: game-changing this is something that's
interesting but a flavor that I would be
[SPEAKER_03]: soon bored of if that's all I was if
that's all I was consuming whereas with
[SPEAKER_03]: like a sour or a camera no gee you know
that's something that you know I could
[SPEAKER_03]: take those all day and be completely
satisfied beautiful beautiful herb I kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of put the skittles where I put the lemon
tree which it's an interesting flavor but
[SPEAKER_03]: I only want to see it as like 20% of
across as it were I don't really want to
[SPEAKER_03]: see it as like the whole thing but yet to
answer I don't think I would not say that
[SPEAKER_03]: the skittles was a sherb s1 yeah it's I
mean if you've seen the flower it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: it's ugly it's like and it's not just that
they grow it poorly it's that it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: really super high grade herb in that way
it's very very tasty though and amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: for extracts much like the lemon tree yeah
and what I found interesting that you kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of brought that point about the lemon tree
is I always find it very peculiar how
[SPEAKER_02]: similar the terpene profile is between
sherbet and lemon tree even though one's
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously more orangey ones more kind of
more lemony but I feel like there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: underlying similarity between the two
between the lemon tree and the sherb sorry
[SPEAKER_03]: lemon tree and skittles yes yeah if you
asked me if you said hey the skit the the
[SPEAKER_03]: lemon tree was an s1 of the skittles or or
the skittles was an s1 of the lemon tree
[SPEAKER_03]: which you know we all think is just some
lemon you know lemon from basically the
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa Cruz area that had been there
supposedly for years anyway and that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that's not an area I spent a lot
of time in up in that up in those
[SPEAKER_03]: mountains but my understanding is that
that's all the lemon tree is it's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: rebranded lemon cut that was you know
popular in that area for a long time
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway and if you told me the skittles was
an s1 of the lemon tree that I would
[SPEAKER_03]: believe that would actually make a lot of
sense to me but that's another one where
[SPEAKER_03]: like there's never been a male there's no
male skittles like that I've ever seen and
[SPEAKER_03]: you could correct me if I'm wrong but I
don't think there's ever been like an
[SPEAKER_03]: actual male they've crossed it with things
and then they did like the zoz and some
[SPEAKER_03]: other stuff but I don't think there was
ever an actual male of skittles yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: think you're correct on that one
interesting yeah I noticed that another
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of older strain from around those
older days that I noticed when your feed
[SPEAKER_02]: was the Las Vegas purple Kush I'd love to
know how did you get it because you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't see a lot about it and people
don't often speak about it but there are
[SPEAKER_02]: some people who hang on to it so I figure
it must have some value what's your take
[SPEAKER_03]: on it so that cut as we can trace that cut
back pretty far within within our personal
[SPEAKER_03]: circle and the cut originally so so we
attribute that the cut that cut to
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody named Hydrosun who passed away he
was the one that brought that cut into our
[SPEAKER_03]: circle he was definitely a character as
most of us tend to be and he had sourced
[SPEAKER_03]: that cut from some people that he knew up
in Washington I believe and originally
[SPEAKER_03]: another friend of mine who is super
underground he was the one that actually
[SPEAKER_03]: got that cut for our friend Hydrosun and
Hydrosun brought that cut down to to Vegas
[SPEAKER_03]: and spread it to our circle out there and
from there it spread it spread to some of
[SPEAKER_03]: our guys in the Bay Area I always avoided
it because it grew like a bubba and I
[SPEAKER_03]: never liked bubba at all I'd had no
interest in bubba I didn't want to grow it
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the profile and the samples
that I had seen of bubba were kind of weak
[SPEAKER_03]: it was kind of after the bubba had been
grown kind of well and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: getting commercialized and whatnot and so
just a bad samples I'd never really been
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed by it but that's a cut that I
kept for a long long time it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: plant it's hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: I think inspector or I think the doctor
has come out and back and forth here and
[SPEAKER_03]: there and said that oh it's a bubba ass
one or something or it's a weak version of
[SPEAKER_03]: bubba and yeah for me I always thought it
was a great plant I know in our circle
[SPEAKER_03]: it's always been very very popular it
definitely spread from there whether other
[SPEAKER_03]: people were able to get it through other
avenues and maybe that's where they
[SPEAKER_03]: acquired it I know there's some people in
the Midwest we've spoken to that have held
[SPEAKER_03]: it and grown it for a while as well I know
that our circle and hydro sun in
[SPEAKER_03]: particular we're responsible for spreading
that cut it's like I said it's not a cut
[SPEAKER_03]: that anyone's gonna have any interest in
today it you know it doesn't trim up well
[SPEAKER_03]: does not have a ton of bag appeal it grows
very very interesting potent flower but
[SPEAKER_03]: you know who's to say kind of anything
beyond that I just I believe that it came
[SPEAKER_03]: out of a garden in Washington originally
when we got it and then we spread it down
[SPEAKER_03]: to Vegas and I think that's where it took
that name and then from there it kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: spread out but it is it's a cut that's
kind of that's known but it seems unknown
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way as well I don't really know that
that many people outside are like familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with it so it's interesting that you bring
it up yeah because it's kind of one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those ones which does persist on but
doesn't get a lot of mention does it no
[SPEAKER_03]: well we've we've definitely kept it around
I mean it has a place in our circle and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think people certain individuals have an
affinity for it one or two people in
[SPEAKER_03]: particular that I'm thinking about that I
think there are just certain cups certain
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts that they're gonna keep probably
forever and that's one of those cuts they
[SPEAKER_03]: just love it I mean grown grown right you
know they've had good results with it I
[SPEAKER_03]: think one of my friends grew it in deep
water culture which spread sped up the veg
[SPEAKER_03]: and increased the yield on it so you know
he has a special place for it in his
[SPEAKER_03]: garden always and yes it's kind of cool to
see it continue to survive and persist
[SPEAKER_03]: I've definitely done some work with it
I've done an LVPK Sherb and a couple other
[SPEAKER_03]: little projects with it that I think you
know a lot of that stuff a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds they just go to friends of mine so
and a lot of them they're not on Instagram
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't care about anything they're
just they're just doing what they do and
[SPEAKER_03]: they just they just want to grow you know
we all we've all just been sharing seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time I mean a lot of those
Sherb seeds I never made them available
[SPEAKER_03]: people didn't really have a chance to buy
them they mostly just went to friends of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine yeah okay well I mean heck speaking
of seeds I've noticed that you tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: make good mix of both femme and regular
seeds do you have one you prefer most and
[SPEAKER_02]: do you feel like feminized seeds will
eventually overtake regularity overtake
[SPEAKER_03]: regular seeds in popularity so yes so for
years and years you know there was the
[SPEAKER_03]: common thought that like oh you know
femmes are unstable this that and the
[SPEAKER_03]: other whatever it might be you know that
that had kind of stuck in my mind for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while until we actually until I started
seeing people doing work with them and
[SPEAKER_03]: then kind of seeing what was coming from
it and I started to understand a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more they're like not necessarily you
know if if the work if it was done you
[SPEAKER_03]: know unintentionally or whatever it might
be then yes you know especially some like
[SPEAKER_03]: the sours and whatnot but if you do it
intentionally I do feel like so I've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of regular male female work and if
you do a poor selection on the male you
[SPEAKER_03]: are kind of dooming that whole line
everything that comes after that is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably not going to be good and really
the only way to know is to use the male
[SPEAKER_03]: grow out the seeds see we see what comes
of it and then determine okay this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: solid male and then probably go back and
do another line with them what I really
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate about the femmes especially you
know like the clone onlys or whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: might be well I guess that the term is
kind of loose these days but basically
[SPEAKER_03]: like selected cuts versus you know just a
general male or whatnot if you take if I
[SPEAKER_03]: take a sherb which people know and I cross
it to let's say a skittles which people
[SPEAKER_03]: know you're kind of taking the breeder out
of the equation at that point what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: really depending on is does this person
actually have these cuts and so for me
[SPEAKER_03]: going forward some of the work you know is
going to be more more focused on the
[SPEAKER_03]: femmes because I think that people really
that's really what people want I mean a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people they don't really want to
breed so if you don't want to breed you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to do the sex testing you don't
want to have to identify anything you have
[SPEAKER_03]: a limited amount of space some people
stick to plant counts or whatnot and
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever they are they would rather just
pop femmes they would rather say okay cool
[SPEAKER_03]: this is you know gelato 25 cross with
dosito perfect like this will work you
[SPEAKER_03]: know and your gelato and sherb or you know
wedding cake and sherb your take you're
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the breeder out of the equation
you're taking their personal kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not able to influence as much the
process so you're just saying hey
[SPEAKER_03]: basically thanks for having the legitimate
cut thank you for providing these seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and I hope they germinate and then you
know basically your service is done and
[SPEAKER_03]: that brings up a point you know for me as
well which I don't know if it's something
[SPEAKER_03]: you were going to ask but a lot of what's
going on out there right now it's people
[SPEAKER_03]: not working with legitimate cuttings and I
think that's one of the reasons that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been able to do what I do is because
people know that if I say I have something
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's that it is that and that's
something that I've earned over a long
[SPEAKER_03]: long time in this business I think when
people pop up now and they've got no
[SPEAKER_03]: reputation they've got no name they're not
I'm not honestly I hold inspector in high
[SPEAKER_03]: regard I was gonna say you know like
they're not inspector they're not these
[SPEAKER_03]: other people not to put myself with him
but if inspector says he has a cut I 100%
[SPEAKER_03]: believe it so when he did those triangle
kushev swans and people were complaining
[SPEAKER_03]: about the price I was dying laughing
because the opportunity to get a triangle
[SPEAKER_03]: kush s1 which took him multiple attempts
to achieve from inspector is invaluable
[SPEAKER_03]: and if you can't see that then you know
it's not for you because you know that's
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a guy who if he says he has
something it is exactly what he says it is
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's that's something that's like
sorely lacking I see people popping up
[SPEAKER_03]: right now and they're saying oh you know I
got the runs or I got this or I got that
[SPEAKER_03]: or you know something comes out and they
already have a whole line with it and a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole reverse fem line to all these other
ones and it's like who number one who are
[SPEAKER_03]: you totally fine go ahead and get your
money but number two like just like is it
[SPEAKER_03]: really is it really what you say it is and
you know I think I think there's there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of that going on but for me yeah I
mean I intend to keep doing some male
[SPEAKER_03]: female work but that work takes longer and
just like that as is though people aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: really interested in you know people
people don't people don't see the value of
[SPEAKER_03]: working something two or three or four
generations you're really kind of limiting
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself and from that kind of perspective
people more want exactly what they know so
[SPEAKER_03]: if you say I've got a wedding cake and a
sherb they're very into that but if you
[SPEAKER_03]: say oh I've got a Vietnam black tie with a
grand doggie perp cross with a grand
[SPEAKER_03]: doggie perp banana limo and then you have
to explain all that to them you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: say all the limoing in cross was from swan
song seeds and it's a double sour diesel
[SPEAKER_03]: shit trail and you know it's crossed with
the banana but it's not the banana OG it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a Sonoma cut that we had it's like banana
runs almost and then you know we made that
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the grand doggie perp is a chem
DGDP from connoisseur back in the day and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know you got to explain all this stuff
to them and the Vietnam black tie is from
[SPEAKER_03]: ace and most people are gonna be like
who's ace and what is that and what is all
[SPEAKER_03]: of that like where's the cookies at that's
honestly that's what they're gonna say so
[SPEAKER_03]: literally if I just do cookies to cookies
people will buy that you know fortunately
[SPEAKER_03]: for me like honestly I'm a little bit more
difficult about selling my seeds I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really care if people buy them or don't
buy them and that's not to be
[SPEAKER_03]: disrespectful of anyone that's just to say
like I do what I do because I want to do
[SPEAKER_03]: it and because I think it's gonna be good
but when it comes down to actually selling
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds why would you spend three or four
years on a project when people are pumping
[SPEAKER_03]: out six projects a year of just fems to
fems you know they I mean people are
[SPEAKER_03]: literally going to dispensary and buying a
gelato 33 clone and reversing it to
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else or they're popping one
pack of seeds from somebody else and just
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting a bunch of stuff and just renaming
it saying they have this saying they have
[SPEAKER_03]: that and I think that a lot of that is
kind of what's going on out there right
[SPEAKER_03]: now but yeah for me I'm gonna still do
some fem work the fem work is tricky to
[SPEAKER_03]: you know an inspector I've been grateful
to take some time from him you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not they don't always work I tried to do a
high life reversal barely worked barely
[SPEAKER_03]: put out any seeds very very very
frustrating that when that happens and all
[SPEAKER_03]: you can really do is just go back to the
drawing board and just try again you know
[SPEAKER_03]: and I know I know Matt Matt sells some
solutions and one of my buddies chef wrote
[SPEAKER_03]: from people under the stairs he's he has
another solution that he makes and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know we're toying with some different
things and some gibberellic acid and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot in the mix with the STS to see if
you know we'll get the intended results
[SPEAKER_03]: that we need but you know generally it's
not always the fems aren't always
[SPEAKER_03]: guaranteed either and so I understand you
know like like that's why I feel like they
[SPEAKER_03]: can kind of command a higher premium
because and I think people don't
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that like what it takes to back
up so many plants like the commitment that
[SPEAKER_03]: it takes to keep such a diverse library
it's there's a lot of people that are just
[SPEAKER_03]: going to the dispensary buying eight
clones and you know they start a seed
[SPEAKER_03]: company and that's great and that's fine
and Dan they don't even keep any of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts they just go back and buy them again
they hope it's the same cut you know maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: they hope maybe they don't care but to
back up the sheer number of plants you
[SPEAKER_03]: know that I have backed up over the years
and that people like inspect a backup
[SPEAKER_03]: that's why I feel like they deserve a
premium that's why I feel like you know
[SPEAKER_03]: it's worth paying them what they ask
because of what it takes to go into that
[SPEAKER_03]: you mean you're not just paying for you
know somebody to make some seeds in the
[SPEAKER_03]: tent or something it's like this person is
dedicated years to sourcing collecting
[SPEAKER_03]: preserving transporting moving you know
cloning backing up whatever it might be
[SPEAKER_03]: and then tried to do these things for you
but yeah no I'm always gonna do some
[SPEAKER_03]: regular male female work and and some fem
work I enjoy the fem work honestly a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people want that they don't they don't
care about breeding they have no interest
[SPEAKER_03]: in males like they just want to pop some
seeds grow some flowers pick a female and
[SPEAKER_02]: go from there yeah I agree with just
almost everything you said you know like
[SPEAKER_02]: that that trusting a breeder and not doing
the the kind of the the shady acts that we
[SPEAKER_02]: see certain breeders like copycat genetics
fuck you big Dan I hate you that guy's
[SPEAKER_02]: trash in every sense but yeah you know and
someone like inspector on the other hand
[SPEAKER_02]: you know the epitome of kind of what you
can trust as the gold standard so yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: totally agree and we're gonna talk about
some azazel stuff soon because I'm super
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in that like above all things
but I want to quickly ask you do you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like when you're converting a female to be
like the pollen donor for a cross do you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like that causes any sort of stress
like do you feel like the results of you
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that is different from if the plant
had hermed out or do you feel like they're
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially the same result I feel I feel
that they're different in my experience
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants that herm out as it were tend
to produce more unstable seeds and when
[SPEAKER_03]: you intentionally do it it seems to
actually produce more stable seeds but I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean that could just be a matter of the
plant that herm that was initially more
[SPEAKER_03]: prone to that anyway so maybe maybe if
maybe it wouldn't have had anything to do
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway maybe if you had sprayed the plant
that was gonna herm out it would do it
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway whereas the other one is just less
prone to doing so I've never tried both
[SPEAKER_03]: ways to be honest but in my experience I
think that if you do it intentionally
[SPEAKER_03]: versus if it happens accidentally it's I
feel I find it to be more more reliable in
[SPEAKER_02]: my experience yeah definitely I can I can
back that myself with my limited
[SPEAKER_02]: experience making femme and so the
follow-up question is have you ever done
[SPEAKER_02]: any kind of more weird breeding stuff with
your regular things and by that I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: like we often refer to how DJ short had
many moons ago reference like that
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodite males were good males to
breed you ever do any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: left-of-field stuff like that at all or
you try to keep it pretty straightforward
[SPEAKER_03]: no I try and keep it pretty basic it's
it's it's a very very complicated game to
[SPEAKER_03]: play and anyway and to try and complicate
it even further I would leave that to
[SPEAKER_03]: someone like DJ or some of these other
people out there I mean the kind of work
[SPEAKER_03]: that that DJ has done is not really the
kind of work that I would want to do like
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't the kind of breeding that
he's done is different than what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in for me I'm most interested
in taking like things that are popular now
[SPEAKER_03]: and combining them with things that are
you know kind of out of left field that
[SPEAKER_03]: people wouldn't expect like like I did a
Burma with the gb6 tricks and that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: something that anybody's doing and in fact
when I made it low-key was he even asked
[SPEAKER_03]: he's like nobody's gonna want that
nobody's gonna care about Burma or Lucy or
[SPEAKER_03]: any of this weird stuff that you're doing
and I said it's fine people will grab
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever they want they'll grab dosito
face on fire they'll grab this they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: grab that they'll grab the peanut butter
breath whatever is they're interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: it's totally fine I do that because I like
to do that and that's you know I enjoy
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that's probably about as weird as I
get is kind of combining some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: left field cultivars with something that
people would not expect it to be combined
[SPEAKER_02]: with of course so when you are looking to
select a male what are the some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: traits you find ideal in a male like would
you have any tips for the audience they
[SPEAKER_02]: love this type of things like is there any
sort of visual cues or anything that you
[SPEAKER_03]: like to go with yeah so the first thing is
that I look for is structure I like a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that has what I consider ideal
structure I don't want something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: too stocky I don't want something that has
weird internotal spacing I don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: something I mean I have a specific type of
plant that I that I look to make and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: more geared towards indoor cultivation I
wanted to have a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: internotal spacing I wanted to have like
proper size flowers I don't want I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes it happens but I don't want like
just giant spear colas like this you know
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not 1985 I'm not trying to grow
something to put my forearm next to it I
[SPEAKER_03]: want I like to grow what I consider like
proper you know two three gram flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: like on you know on a nice size plant so
the biggest thing I would say would be
[SPEAKER_03]: structure vigor definitely like the leaf
like how leafy it is so when something is
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely leafy I think about like what
it's gonna be to maintain that plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: grow that plant and at scale something
required if it requires a lot more work
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just not worth it so I think a lot
about that and then also when it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: time to flower them let's say I've got you
know 20 males I'm trying to flower I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: eliminate the first ones to show I don't
want them and you know I don't know if
[SPEAKER_03]: that's something that other people have
touched on before but to me that's a sign
[SPEAKER_03]: that something is like a little bit more
susceptible to having intersex expressions
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit less stable I want something
that's gonna show a little bit later and I
[SPEAKER_03]: want something that's gonna be a little
bit more resistant so you know you can be
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit rough on them you should be a
little bit rough on them you should see
[SPEAKER_03]: how they respond and it's it's tough for
me because I definitely don't like to
[SPEAKER_03]: abuse them but I think it's important to
see how they respond and to see which ones
[SPEAKER_03]: really which ones kind of have the widest
bandwidth so that's something that I think
[SPEAKER_03]: about a lot with plants is how tolerant
they are and I feel like that's something
[SPEAKER_03]: that we don't talk about as much like not
all plants have the same bandwidth and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just what I call it they don't all
have the same range they're not all able
[SPEAKER_03]: to take the temperature swings or the pH
swings or the nutrient imbalances or you
[SPEAKER_03]: know whatever it might be they don't all
respond the same way and so I definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: look for plants that have a wider
bandwidth if if the pH swings during the
[SPEAKER_03]: feed you know and these three don't
respond well I'll eliminate them because
[SPEAKER_03]: to me that says this is a plant that has
that needs a really really specific set of
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions in order for it to thrive
that's a plant that I don't want because
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not what I'm looking for and I feel
like it'll pass those it could pass those
[SPEAKER_03]: traits on so why would I keep that plant
so mostly I would say that's probably the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest thing is just to see how they
respond to look at the structure I
[SPEAKER_03]: eliminate the early flowering ones and
then you know I go from there one thing
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never done that I'm actually very
interested in doing is to reverse a male
[SPEAKER_03]: to see how it produces what the resin
profile is like just a lot of those
[SPEAKER_03]: different factors and I'm sure you've
heard people talk about doing that before
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been a topic of conversation for
years I know that some people have done it
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's a really interesting
way to kind of see which male would be
[SPEAKER_03]: worth going with and it's something I'd
probably like to do on my next project
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I think that'll get you some really
interesting results we've heard a few
[SPEAKER_02]: people talk about it but it is still very
much like a bit of a uncertain thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: hasn't been delved into too much I did
however want to ask you in general what
[SPEAKER_02]: are you currently working on what are you
excited for yeah so right now I'm trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to figure out what I want to do next we're
seeing a lot of the results from the GP6
[SPEAKER_03]: tricks project I had tried to do that
highlife project which did not work out
[SPEAKER_03]: for me not quite sure what I want to do I
think we may take one of the selections
[SPEAKER_03]: from the gb6 tricks project to start a new
line from so one of the things we did was
[SPEAKER_03]: that we kept a couple of lines for
ourselves and we didn't release them one
[SPEAKER_03]: was the gelato 41 gb6 tricks and the other
one was the biscotti gb6 tricks and so
[SPEAKER_03]: both of those haven't been released and I
right now we're in the process of hunting
[SPEAKER_03]: some of those low-key is hunting some of
them right now and I've got a couple going
[SPEAKER_03]: as well and I think if what we're seeing
we really like and I think it would be an
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement to that line and I think it
might be a good foundation for a future
[SPEAKER_03]: FEM project I mean things are moving so
quickly that it's kind of hard to say me
[SPEAKER_03]: personally I would like to do something
totally off off something totally off the
[SPEAKER_03]: reservation as it were like some Honduran
or some Guatemalan or you know I've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: friend from Colombia you know that got me
some seeds I'd be interested in working
[SPEAKER_03]: some of that stuff but you know I've you
know in conversations with my friends one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the discussions we've had is basically
it's just like yeah no one no one is gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be interested in that and so there's the
part of me that doesn't really care and
[SPEAKER_03]: then there's the part of me that thinks
well like I do it for me but I also do it
[SPEAKER_03]: so that other people will grow it and so I
have to consider you know what people want
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean if I just make something that is of
only interest a handful of us is it really
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be impactful is it really gonna make
a difference are people really even gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it and if they're not if the answer
is no then why why make it or why make it
[SPEAKER_03]: at scale just make it for myself then if I
want and grow it out if I feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it out but yeah I would say right
now we're probably looking towards working
[SPEAKER_03]: on one of those are probably a reversal I
have a wedding cake sure that I really
[SPEAKER_03]: like as well but sometimes I kind of feel
like maybe some of those things they've
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of had their time and a thing that I
forget it's kind of how far ahead of the
[SPEAKER_03]: curve my friends and I have always been
and something that to us is kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like washed kind of like over it
as it were kind of blown out still has a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of traction I mean people still buy a
lot of wedding cake crosses they still buy
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of GMO crosses they still want to
grow that and you know back East
[SPEAKER_03]: especially like a lot of the market isn't
even really there yet like they're they're
[SPEAKER_03]: still excited about wedding cake and you
know wedding cake is something that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know hasn't been popular out West in in
the straight form for at least three or
[SPEAKER_03]: four years I mean it's something that you
see but it's kind of like becoming like a
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of become like a staple it's kind of
become like a thing that's around but not
[SPEAKER_03]: something that people are really really
excited about so I think you know there's
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some work that could be done with
the gelato 41 tricks that I think would be
[SPEAKER_03]: good or the biscotti tricks I would like
to work the Burma tricks potentially and
[SPEAKER_03]: the Lucy tricks and then maybe go back to
do some of the Sherb crosses as well going
[SPEAKER_03]: forward though I don't know we talked
about a little bit that Azazel is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I think has a lot of
potential in it and everybody that's grown
[SPEAKER_03]: it has been really really impressed by it
but it's one of those things where you
[SPEAKER_03]: know if you called it apple runs people
would buy it but if you call it Azazel I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know that people are interested in
it honestly and it's like do how much how
[SPEAKER_02]: much further do I go down that direction
yeah okay well I mean let's talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: that for a quick second do you like to
kind of hunt and go down that route of
[SPEAKER_02]: things that aren't exactly popular because
like as what we see with the Azazel most
[SPEAKER_02]: people aren't specifically requesting
Vietnamese or Thai dominant weed these
[SPEAKER_02]: days do you feel like as a breeder you've
got to accept a certain amount of kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial loss or just you know kind of
sales loss from the casual enthusiast but
[SPEAKER_02]: that then in turn allows you to pursue
some of these more niche and truly exotic
[SPEAKER_03]: lines I do feel that and what I find is
that the people who are interested in my
[SPEAKER_03]: work are extremely passionate so I think
that I have cultivated the right type of
[SPEAKER_03]: people for what I want to do but
commercially it's not gonna be something
[SPEAKER_03]: that you know like an Azazel or Vietnamese
or a Thai is not gonna be something that
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily is you know is gonna is gonna
make a ton of waves however that being
[SPEAKER_03]: said I mean when you look at the Mac it's
the Colombian in it that that really
[SPEAKER_03]: surprises people and it's what gives it
that profile that lemony profile or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever whatever you want to call that
weird how do my friend describe it like a
[SPEAKER_03]: like a raspberry yogurt or something but
the lemon is is what comes out all the
[SPEAKER_03]: rest of it all the crosses so I think that
you know I'm gonna continue to do what I
[SPEAKER_03]: love to do I think that there is a group
of people out there that appreciate the
[SPEAKER_03]: work that I do and I do it mostly because
I love it I've always done this because I
[SPEAKER_03]: love it and I've been grateful to be able
to do that and I've always been the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: that instead of just running one strength
I've run you know a dozen and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: make any sense to people and you leave a
bunch of money on the table and it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: efficient and requires a lot more work but
I've always done this because I love to do
[SPEAKER_03]: it and so I accept whatever comes with
that which is yeah maybe you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: you are gonna leave some sales on the
table I mean we did some GMOs ones and
[SPEAKER_03]: they flew this tiny tiny drop super small
you know but they flew and you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: vendor that picked them up said that if I
had done you know a bunch more of them
[SPEAKER_03]: they would all still go but a lot of the
other stuff people aren't interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: you know if you do I mean we did Death
Star cherry pie with the Mendel breath UV
[SPEAKER_03]: wet dream and you know people that have
grown and love it I mean somebody grew
[SPEAKER_03]: chem 91 Mendel breath UV wet dream that I
made and you know told me the herb was
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal I mean they loved it but it
doesn't have what people want like nowhere
[SPEAKER_03]: in there does it say gelato or sherb or
cake or whatever or breath it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: any of that in there it's something I mean
I guess it does is it has the Mendel
[SPEAKER_03]: breath but like very very sparingly not in
a way that people would want it so when
[SPEAKER_02]: you do decide to go down this route of
exploring one of these lines which is kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of more for your own interest than for a
commercial success so to speak not that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're mutually exclusive but you know
hopefully you get what I mean is it
[SPEAKER_02]: because you have fond memories of some of
the components of these lines you're kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of chasing that fear feeling of the old
Vietnamese type strains or is it more so
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's just a really interesting
combination of things you don't see often
[SPEAKER_03]: to me it's literally because life is short
and I have zero interest in trying to just
[SPEAKER_03]: make a bunch of money and do whatever
people expect you to do I'm gonna do what
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do and so if I have an
opportunity to work something unique and
[SPEAKER_03]: something different that's what I'm gonna
do and you know like I said the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that doing that kind of work attracts are
the kind of people that I want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: around I mean I've been really really
fortunate to connect with a lot of really
[SPEAKER_03]: good people a group at New Mexico that you
know super passionate about the work that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing and one of them is growing the
Azazel and he told me I mean his
[SPEAKER_03]: description of it was yes super unique
really really interesting you know shorter
[SPEAKER_03]: quicker flowering but it has that
Vietnamese Thai profile and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: something that when when you show it to
people they haven't seen that they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: even know what that is there's a whole
generation of people that I mean honestly
[SPEAKER_03]: most of them haven't even seen flower all
they do is dab so when you show them a
[SPEAKER_03]: proper flower of something like that it
shows I think I think it could change
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody's life to see something like that
it could show them that there's more to
[SPEAKER_03]: this than just cookie cookie cookie cookie
you know there's like there's other stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: out there and I think that you know that
that to me is valuable and the high is
[SPEAKER_03]: different the effect is different the
terpene profile is different and I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: it's something that people nowadays don't
see like I was saying earlier you know a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the herb today is very very
narcotic people are looking for something
[SPEAKER_03]: to basically be a substitute for a pill
and yeah they can find it out there but I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't to me it's not always about that I
mean I've been I've been blessed to smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: some really really interesting flower and
you know the effects from them can be way
[SPEAKER_03]: way different and I don't know that a lot
of people have ever had flower like that
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I would I would agree it's certainly
one of the rare ones right just not
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not last question but the one
before you mentioned wet dream this is one
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you about because I
noticed the cult classics used it in some
[SPEAKER_02]: of their lines would you be able to fill
us in on where you fit in with the wet
[SPEAKER_03]: dream and where they fit in yeah so the
wet dream was a project that some friends
[SPEAKER_03]: and I had done we started it and I
mentioned earlier it was you know from
[SPEAKER_03]: reef and then we hit the blue dream and we
grew it outside for a couple of seasons
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I had had some that I had
flowered out I was gonna try and do
[SPEAKER_03]: another I did I was on the f3 generation
of it and I gathered some pollen from it
[SPEAKER_03]: to kind of further the line a little bit
more and I actually gave it and went down
[SPEAKER_03]: and saw my friend norcal and gave it to
him at the time he was growing the dog's
[SPEAKER_03]: waltz and I liked it that was a great
plant very very interesting and so I said
[SPEAKER_03]: hey I said do you mind hitting the dog's
waltz and making some seeds for me with it
[SPEAKER_03]: and he said yeah no problem he has a lot
of stuff going on in his life so he had
[SPEAKER_03]: that pollen and at some point he connected
with cult classics because they they know
[SPEAKER_03]: each other and he gave him he gave him the
pollen or he sorry he gave him he hit the
[SPEAKER_03]: OG KB and he hit the Mendo breath and he
gave cult classics thus the OG KB seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: from from that project the next time that
I heard about that because we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty busy some somebody contacted me and
said hey are you working with cult
[SPEAKER_03]: classics and I said who's cult classics
and he said yeah he's got a OG KB wet
[SPEAKER_03]: dream line that he's releasing you don't
know anything about this I said no I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know anything about it so I called Norcal
and talked to him for a bit and he's like
[SPEAKER_03]: oh man I completely forgot that you gave
me that pollen he's like yeah I'm working
[SPEAKER_03]: with him on this seed project and you know
we're doing the OG KB stuff and blah blah
[SPEAKER_03]: blah this that and the other I had never
heard of him I had never met him I would
[SPEAKER_03]: not have given him my pollen this is a
conversation that I have had publicly I
[SPEAKER_03]: think with him at one point and but
because Norcal is my friend and I figured
[SPEAKER_03]: he would you know get compensated from it
rather than cause a problem like what's
[SPEAKER_03]: done is done I just let it go I had a lot
of other stuff going on a lot of other
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I was working on anyway so it
didn't really bother me then just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like and I don't want to go too much into
his personal issues but I'll just suffice
[SPEAKER_03]: it to say that like they didn't
necessarily it didn't really work out the
[SPEAKER_03]: way that he wanted it to work out not in
all full transparency not an individual
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've ever wanted to be associated
with a person that I've met one time and
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had any interest in further
associating with him I never got
[SPEAKER_03]: compensated on any of that stuff never had
really any interest as long as Norcal was
[SPEAKER_03]: getting you know compensated in some way
shape or form beyond that you know I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen a lot of people run the work I've
seen a lot of people be excited about it
[SPEAKER_03]: it is kind of cool to see that because you
know what they're most excited about is
[SPEAKER_03]: usually the fact that there's no no
intersex issues that have been found in
[SPEAKER_03]: those seeds the size the vigor the resin
production the profiles you know if
[SPEAKER_03]: anything I think it's a testament to the
work that my friends and I did over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years with that pollen that being said it
was not ever intended for release nor did
[SPEAKER_03]: I ever have any nor would I have ever
worked with somebody like him it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: what happened and from there I would say
at some point he did give me a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: the other OGKB wet dream seeds that
existed and he also gave me some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: MendoBreath UV wet dream seeds that
existed and so I was able to you know keep
[SPEAKER_03]: those and I've used the MendoBreath UV wet
dreams in a line that I did and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: other than that I would say yeah it's kind
of cool to see it get out there he did a
[SPEAKER_03]: hell of a job with the branding and the
promotion but just as a general human
[SPEAKER_03]: being he's not somebody that I would
associate with or would ever want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with unfortunately it's a
common sentiment we hear in general when
[SPEAKER_02]: people have this type of thing happen to
them but I guess on the more above board
[SPEAKER_02]: side of things we see and you mentioned
earlier that you've been collaborating
[SPEAKER_02]: with Grow Low Key and a few projects do
you plan to do more collabs with them
[SPEAKER_02]: going forward and do you see collabs
becoming like a more popular option in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry going forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do I could see people working together
more collaboratively we do intend to do
[SPEAKER_03]: another project together so right now I
think we're just kind of in the planning
[SPEAKER_03]: phase like I said if he finds something in
this recent hunt or I find something that
[SPEAKER_03]: may be the direction we go down we've
shared cuts back and forth so there are
[SPEAKER_03]: some potential lines in there and then I
also have a huge you know collection of my
[SPEAKER_03]: own that I could pull from if I was
interested so yeah we definitely plan on
[SPEAKER_03]: working together he's another one of those
guys he's just a stand-up person somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm happy to work with and be
associated with and you know he shared
[SPEAKER_03]: that tricks with me that's a plant that he
hasn't given to anybody else so it took
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it took a lot of trust in him to
give me that and to share it with me and
[SPEAKER_03]: to trust that I wouldn't put it out there
you know without without without his
[SPEAKER_03]: approval basically so I'm definitely
looking forward and I do think that there
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to be a lot of more collaborative
projects going forward mostly because
[SPEAKER_03]: people are just becoming more comfortable
with meeting people and kind of being out
[SPEAKER_03]: there and so we're meeting people outside
of our immediate circle than we would
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise associate with and you know low
key was somebody that I met when I threw
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers market event we actually threw the
first cannabis farmers market in SF and
[SPEAKER_03]: through a through a delivery service that
I had and he actually came out there he
[SPEAKER_03]: was super humble he came and asked about
some baleen flower that I had been posting
[SPEAKER_03]: and growing and I told them we were sold
out because we were and he didn't say
[SPEAKER_03]: anything he just walked away and then he
came back with my buddy straight flame and
[SPEAKER_03]: straight flame was like hey man this is
grow low key blah blah blah I'm like um
[SPEAKER_03]: and he was much smaller still at that time
but I said I said hey I said why didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: you say that you know why don't you say
you knew straight flame or whatever who
[SPEAKER_03]: you were he just didn't want to say
anything but I you know I had a stash of
[SPEAKER_03]: baleen flowers for all my friends and so I
pulled out of there and gave him a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of stuff but yeah good guy and just you
know like like I said people are starting
[SPEAKER_03]: to come out meet more people I had a
couple friends that didn't want to come to
[SPEAKER_03]: that event because they were pretty sure
we were gonna get rated so some people are
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely getting more comfortable
because since then a lot of those events
[SPEAKER_03]: the farmers markets and the sessions and
all that stuff have definitely popped up
[SPEAKER_02]: and so when you do a collab what's the
ideal collab set up for you like do you
[SPEAKER_02]: like it when say each person brings one
parent to the table or do you think it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't necessarily have to work like that
is there a set kind of format you like or
[SPEAKER_03]: just whatever flows happens I think I
think kind of whatever whatever happens I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean for me he had a really nice plant to
contribute and I had kind of the stable
[SPEAKER_03]: that we could pollinate he also gave me a
couple that we could pollinate from his
[SPEAKER_03]: collection so I feel like that was a
really mutually beneficial situation for
[SPEAKER_03]: both of us I got to pollinate some cuts
that were in demand like the Dubs garden
[SPEAKER_03]: peanut butter breath and obviously his
tricks and whatnot and then you know he
[SPEAKER_03]: got access to a lot of my genetics which
you know I had brought the gelato 41 in
[SPEAKER_03]: the biscotti and whatnot to the table so
that's you know one of the definitely one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the positive sides of just being who we
are and where we're from is just having
[SPEAKER_03]: access to all the genetics whether it's
the runs or the gelatos or this or that or
[SPEAKER_03]: the other like we've always been some of
the first people to have those so just
[SPEAKER_03]: being kind of first in space and then you
know getting access to that and me being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to contribute some things and him
being able to contribute from his side of
[SPEAKER_03]: the circle really worked beneficially for
both of us I mean I have a project going
[SPEAKER_03]: with a friend of mine right now that I'm
not gonna get into too much but basically
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent him some pollen and you know he's
gonna pollinate something that's you know
[SPEAKER_03]: super in demand right now and so we'll see
you know if people are interested or not
[SPEAKER_03]: interested regardless you know we're
always gonna we're always gonna keep doing
[SPEAKER_02]: what we like cool cool that that's
interesting to hear so just to jump back
[SPEAKER_02]: to some things we were talking about
before you mentioned that you know like a
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds that you've used some of their work
along with connoisseur let's talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these older breeds who often don't
get a good mention like connoisseur is a
[SPEAKER_02]: good one because as far as I can see he's
always done pretty good work but it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't frequently get a mention what was
it that drew you to the grand doggy perps
[SPEAKER_02]: and what's your general opinion on
connoisseur genetics so I love the chem D
[SPEAKER_03]: and the GDP you can't you can't have lived
in Oakland and not appreciate purple and
[SPEAKER_03]: then the chem you know I really
appreciated the pairing I mean I had
[SPEAKER_03]: watched connoisseur and OJD and them
working for a while with really just a
[SPEAKER_03]: nice collection of UK varieties like the
church and whatnot out there and also some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the stuff from the states and it always
just seemed like they were doing in they
[SPEAKER_03]: had interesting pairings that they were
working and I know that him and true work
[SPEAKER_03]: together and they had a falling out which
I'm sure you know true may or may not
[SPEAKER_03]: speak on when you speak to him but I
always thought that they did interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: work and you know especially the perps and
the chems and I think they were one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: first ones to do a forum cross it may have
been true actually that was one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: first ones to do like a forum cross and
actually publicly release it but I liked a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of that older work you know karma was
somebody who did a lot of older work he's
[SPEAKER_03]: he still managed to stay relevant and he's
moving definitely and doing some things
[SPEAKER_03]: out here and got some of the older
breeders that kind of you know are still
[SPEAKER_03]: out there ace and them doing interesting
work and most guys someone you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: he did some c99 work years ago that was
all really really solid old-time moonshine
[SPEAKER_03]: work stuff like that that you know didn't
really gain a lot of buzz but it was you
[SPEAKER_03]: know good flower I grew a bunch of that
stuff and I enjoyed it I feel like there
[SPEAKER_03]: was just there was more space back then to
it's weird there's like more breeders now
[SPEAKER_03]: but they do there's less variety in my
opinion it's more people doing the same
[SPEAKER_03]: shit and less people doing more unique
work I feel like back then there were less
[SPEAKER_03]: people but they were doing they were doing
very very different work I mean there was
[SPEAKER_03]: always like the Dutch seed banks that kind
of seemed like you could just pick one and
[SPEAKER_03]: swap them for the other you know there was
sagamarta they were doing different stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: back then there was some peak 19 and a
couple other things from them that were
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting but generally you know whether
it was sensei or nirvana or whoever it
[SPEAKER_03]: might be they were all kind of the same
thing at that point even greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you know greenhouse had some
interesting work back then that people
[SPEAKER_03]: seemed to like I didn't really grow much
of it but yeah there was there was a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of just smaller kind of more underground
people that were doing it I mean even og
[SPEAKER_03]: rascal was was doing work back then people
forget those you rascal did work like that
[SPEAKER_03]: back then you know because he doesn't put
seeds out now but you know I've definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: I've run some of his work he did bubble
blue moonshine and a couple other things
[SPEAKER_03]: that people just didn't see you know had a
head was another one you know he had some
[SPEAKER_03]: mass super skunk sour D work res who I'm
sure people have talked about before is
[SPEAKER_03]: another one you know whatever whatever
with the situation and the whole story
[SPEAKER_03]: with him but you know though the work he
was one of the first ones you have to give
[SPEAKER_03]: credit you know he's one of the first ones
to put a sour type plant out in seed form
[SPEAKER_03]: for people and you could grow the seeds
and find something that was similar or
[SPEAKER_03]: better you know I grew res 4d the chem 4
with the sour or 4sd came forward the sour
[SPEAKER_03]: that was phenomenal beautiful herb you
know to this day that's something that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually profit wants to work on I gave
him a pack of the chem sours that I still
[SPEAKER_03]: have that was another phenomenal
combination that he made chem D with the
[SPEAKER_03]: sour in bread line that he was working so
there's yeah there's definitely some older
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders swan song was one he was from the
boards there was a lot of there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that people are never gonna
remember and he did this limon and a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple other ones and the limon is
something that I used in that as is though
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a double sour diesel shit trial and
it's you know it's work like that that if
[SPEAKER_03]: you weren't around if you didn't know
about it if you didn't really want it you
[SPEAKER_03]: were never gonna see it it's not something
you could just go and just pick up
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere you really had you really had to
want it you really had to look for it yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think some of the best gems are like
that and that brings us to the next
[SPEAKER_02]: question perfectly where you reference
that you know you've used some of aces
[SPEAKER_02]: work in your own work would you in general
kind of subscribe to the idea that with
[SPEAKER_02]: ace you know they're breeding with this
really kind of untamed more kind of raw
[SPEAKER_02]: stock so it's inevitable that you're
probably going to get some more kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: wild stuff you're gonna have to put in a
bit more of a hunt would you agree with
[SPEAKER_02]: that sentiment or do you think it's it's
just like most other packs you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably find a keeper in a pack of ten
type of thing or is it a bit more involved
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a bit more involved it
depends which of their lines you work with
[SPEAKER_03]: they have some that are very very open
very kind of wild and they have some that
[SPEAKER_03]: have been selected a little bit more with
the mind of cultivating them indoors or at
[SPEAKER_03]: least you know in a semi greenhouse
environment I think the Vietnam black tie
[SPEAKER_03]: was an example of that I had plants that
went you know 11 weeks 13 weeks 15 weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: there was plants that just didn't want to
stop in there they were massive and but I
[SPEAKER_03]: managed to work it and select an earlier
flowering one and kind of tame it down but
[SPEAKER_03]: it takes some work and that's not
something that people want to hear
[SPEAKER_03]: nowadays they would rather have a candy
rain situation then then to actually put
[SPEAKER_03]: the work in in my opinion they want it
done for them most people most people do
[SPEAKER_03]: not have any interest in that but honestly
that's where some of the most amazing the
[SPEAKER_03]: most unique varieties are going to be
found I mean if you want to really make
[SPEAKER_03]: something game-changing you're gonna have
to come out of left field you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: have to come with something different and
I just don't know you know that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna find that in you know crossing
gelato with dosito like I just I just
[SPEAKER_03]: don't see that happening I don't see how
that would happen especially like I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like a lot of the older genetics are
fading out so if you really really want
[SPEAKER_03]: something different you do kind of have to
pull for something from ace or and I know
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of the people that have
popped up over the last year or two god
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna probably butcher it but I think
it's like the Iranian like seed exchange
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that those guys are out
there gathering wild seeds you know semi
[SPEAKER_03]: semi domesticated some wild you know but
that's you know those are gems right there
[SPEAKER_03]: that's you know access to that work is
really special and I know that my my buddy
[SPEAKER_03]: from people under the stairs chef Ro has
worked with some of that stuff and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely other people out there
collecting it and growing it because they
[SPEAKER_03]: they see the value you know I think
they'll always be those people that want
[SPEAKER_03]: they want to grow something different and
something unique but they're not solely
[SPEAKER_03]: focused on cash cropping this is like this
is a hobby for them it's not something
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're thinking oh you know I need
to get two a lighter three a light it
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to be purple I need to be able to
put inside a runs bag they're not thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: like that they're thinking you know about
a unique experience and that's what you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: find in the ace gear you'll find something
different you might not find anything good
[SPEAKER_03]: at all but if you find something nice
you're gonna find something really nice I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean I'm stoked to have grown a bunch of
those I don't think that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that could ever say that they have
grown a plant like that and I got to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: it and share it with my friends and show
them something really really unique you
[SPEAKER_03]: know and I'm grateful to have had the
opportunity to do that to not be under
[SPEAKER_03]: this pressure I mean I think about these
commercial facilities nowadays the main
[SPEAKER_03]: ask is you know 20% THC X number of grams
per square foot you know this number of
[SPEAKER_03]: days of flowering plants get harvested
when they're expected to be harvested on a
[SPEAKER_03]: schedule not not when they're ready not
not when they're ripe you know then they
[SPEAKER_03]: got to be tested then they got it you know
they got to get packaged I mean they get
[SPEAKER_03]: touched so many times along the way that
by the time you get it it's basically been
[SPEAKER_03]: abused you know that the times of actually
being able to go somewhere and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: chop a branch off of a line and put it
into a jar for yourself you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: those days are mostly gone for people like
most people will never know what that's
[SPEAKER_03]: like most people have never seen flower
like that so how could they appreciate you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what really makes a special flower
special yeah of course just to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about a different older kind of
variety I noticed that you had worked with
[SPEAKER_02]: the super silver haze and that you've done
some crosses with it are there any other
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of older strains from these years
gone by that you would like to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: and also what was the cutting of super
silver haze that you ended up using was it
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the more known ones or just one
you'd found no it's it's the known cut
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's like the multiple cup winning
cut that's a cut that we've had for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time I love it it's it's a way to one that
kind of has a I don't know a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: in our circle they don't really care for
it they don't really appreciate it but I
[SPEAKER_03]: love it and our buddy Wadiz who you know
grew it for a long time as well and won a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple cups with it he he loves it we love
it people down in LA that get it through
[SPEAKER_03]: our friends delivery service they love it
it's a beautiful beautiful cut you know
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried I tried to hunt some super
silver haze from like more recent stock
[SPEAKER_03]: and I didn't find anything worth anything
in there so I always revert back to back
[SPEAKER_03]: to that specific plant as far as like
newer or older varieties as well that I'd
[SPEAKER_03]: be interested in working in I'd say I've
mostly what I have access to I've worked
[SPEAKER_03]: with if I could get anything back that
reminds me of you know something different
[SPEAKER_03]: it would be that there was a plant called
lavender and it's not the soma lavender
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it was a Bay Area cut it might have
come out of NorCal I think it probably did
[SPEAKER_03]: and Mad Farmer actually works with it a
lot and the and the Urkel and I to be
[SPEAKER_03]: honest like I've wanted to buy some of
those crosses but me being me I just want
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just want the cut or S ones of
the cut so that I could work with it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the way that I want and not have it as
diluted that's a plant that I would
[SPEAKER_03]: actually probably like to work with that's
one of the first ones that I actually
[SPEAKER_03]: started with in the Bay Area when I when I
got that cut beautiful plant great profile
[SPEAKER_03]: perfumey like resinous great full relaxing
high to it just a really really beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and that's probably one that I would
like as far as any of the older cuts I
[SPEAKER_03]: would say the Romulan if it existed would
be something that I would be interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: the train wreck is one that I've always
liked that I know that a lot of my friends
[SPEAKER_03]: are gonna listen to that and just shake
their heads but I like it and you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: got to the bay after the train wreck had
already kind of blown through and so I
[SPEAKER_03]: never really got tired of it because I
never really had it to that level the J1
[SPEAKER_03]: would probably be one of those as well I
would say the super silver haze is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the oldest cut though out of all
those cuts before that not there's not
[SPEAKER_03]: really much else that I can think of that
I would actually be interested in I mean I
[SPEAKER_03]: know we've worked with some interesting
stuff the haze like the PIF is one that
[SPEAKER_03]: some friends of mine have worked with
that's one that I would probably be
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in as well just because I would
honestly like to see S ones of it to run
[SPEAKER_03]: through to see what we find I think it
would be a freak of a hunt and then beyond
[SPEAKER_03]: that I mean I know some friends of mine
have talked about the HP 13 and that's one
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just saw some flowers of that
was very interesting very unique different
[SPEAKER_03]: you know there was a sage cut by Escobar
that my friends have grown for a while
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a pretty interesting one it's not
the sage from THC it's it's something else
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's a pretty that's a pretty unique
one I mean those are really the ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: I seek out for my personal kind of garden
for the stuff that I want to do because
[SPEAKER_03]: really like you know like you said or like
I was saying it's like how many gelatos
[SPEAKER_03]: and dosidos and sherbs can we mix together
at some point at some point it's just like
[SPEAKER_03]: really like if that's what you're looking
for here we have this and it's basically
[SPEAKER_02]: the same thing yeah yeah I agree
completely so when you think about
[SPEAKER_02]: starting a new project is it all kind of
based on feel or do you really kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: think about it and if you do kind of put a
bit more thought and maybe kind of writing
[SPEAKER_02]: down your ideas and whatnot what are what
are sort of the considerations that come
[SPEAKER_02]: into play when you are thinking about
starting a new project so mostly I think
[SPEAKER_03]: about what what the intention is what the
goal is and if like I'll give an example
[SPEAKER_03]: is that like we have an orange sherb cut
that low-key found it's phenomenal
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful flower but I don't want to do a
whole lot line based on an orange profile
[SPEAKER_03]: so I won't pick that plant as the basis
for the project I think about really like
[SPEAKER_03]: what what kind of gaps can we fill in that
haven't been filled in before and it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: me think about that's why I think a lot
about those exotic pairings because to
[SPEAKER_03]: just take like you know let's say we take
this this gelato 41 tricks and I hit it to
[SPEAKER_03]: the gelato 33 and I hit it to the run so I
hit it to the apple fritter or whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: might be what am I really actually doing
but for me that's how I feel and I know
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had conversations some of my friends
and they say well you know that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: people want they want to see you know the
Mac or the wedding cake or the sherb or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever they want they want to know both
sides when they see it me I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: about that as much although if I'm doing a
collab with someone I do need to consider
[SPEAKER_03]: that because that may be how they feel and
so I'll be inclined to do a couple for
[SPEAKER_03]: them the way that they would want them to
do which may be more commercially minded
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll do a couple for me that I think
are actually going to be more unique and a
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect example of that is I did the green
crack with the gb6 tricks and people had
[SPEAKER_03]: no interest in it but I kept telling
people like this is going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal pairing and a friend of mine is
growing them now and they're ridiculous
[SPEAKER_03]: and the same thing with the Lucy and the
gb6 tricks 99% of people have no interest
[SPEAKER_03]: care not about the Lucy at all if anything
like kind of like you may have thought
[SPEAKER_03]: when they see the butterscotch I think oh
is that from Canorado they my god that
[SPEAKER_03]: might be interesting from Canorado when
you tell them it's a butterscotch Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_03]: and is you know from reefer man and made
by some guy named poor white farmer all of
[SPEAKER_03]: that is just noise to them they're not
hearing anything that they there's nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: that sounds good to them there and it's
unfortunate because you know out of a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of these plants like the Lucy tricks the
super silver haze tricks the Burma tricks
[SPEAKER_03]: the green crack tricks these older kind of
you know pre 2010 whatever variety
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that were created by people with
not a mind towards commercial production
[SPEAKER_03]: those are some those are some phenomenal
plants you know they're like the pairing
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to be really really unique so I
think when when I when I do something I
[SPEAKER_03]: think like what am I doing why am I doing
it and is it just repeating the same thing
[SPEAKER_03]: if I'm just going to repeat the same thing
then like what is the point of it just
[SPEAKER_03]: make more of the same to do that I'll just
make us ones I mean if people really want
[SPEAKER_03]: that then just take gelato 41 and just
make us ones and take a lot of 33 and just
[SPEAKER_03]: make us ones just do all s ones you know
just stop reading at all just make us ones
[SPEAKER_03]: and if that's kind of your thing do that
but that's not my thing I want to make
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I'm actually interested in
growing like I'm excited you know to I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: excited when I see like I've seen the Lucy
tricks and it has the same butterscotch
[SPEAKER_03]: profile as the Lucy but way better
structure way better bag appeal much
[SPEAKER_03]: improved yield like beautiful beautiful
but it has a distinct profile and my
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling is that because this is being
grown by a rec facility when it hits the
[SPEAKER_03]: market people will not have seen something
like that and that stokes me whereas like
[SPEAKER_03]: yes people will buy you know it's a lot of
41 tricks if we sold it to them but they
[SPEAKER_03]: might not buy Lucy tricks but I think that
if you can get them to try that flower if
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get them to try that concentrate
like it will become something that they
[SPEAKER_03]: seek out because like you were talking
about the craft stuff it's unique and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no denying something that's
different from everything else it stands
[SPEAKER_03]: apart for good for better for worse it
stands out so I think yeah when I when I
[SPEAKER_03]: do a project I think a lot about kind of
just filling in the gaps and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: moving in a direction that other people
aren't moving in no I don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly think about a lot of people I
don't really think about what other people
[SPEAKER_03]: are doing at all I mean I should consider
probably what the market wants but at the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of the day what I have found is that
there's enough people that are passionate
[SPEAKER_03]: about the work that I'm doing that I don't
need to consider the people who don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: it you know and if and like I said if I'm
doing a collab and they want me to do you
[SPEAKER_03]: know for gelato 41 or runs or apple
fritter or something to involve those
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties in there we can do that but at
the same time I'm gonna go and do my weird
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and cross this Burma that nobody
cares about except for maybe three people
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's fine because it's what makes me
happy it's the seeds that I'm most excited
[SPEAKER_03]: about when I see a bunch of you know
gelato 41 seeds and whatever in my fridge
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like doesn't really do anything for
me I know they're gonna be phenomenal I
[SPEAKER_03]: know they're gonna photograph well you
know I know it's gonna look really good I
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's gonna smoke good I know it's
gonna have good flavor I know it's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's gonna make people happy but
there's a lot of other things you know
[SPEAKER_03]: they could they could grow jelly breath or
dosi lotto or whatever and it would
[SPEAKER_02]: probably do the same thing for them yeah I
guess I get the sentiment but I certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like you know man after my own heart
in terms of you know do your own thing and
[SPEAKER_02]: just make the weird crosses that you like
I love that so the next question I would
[SPEAKER_02]: have is I've noticed that you've done a
few crosses using exotic Mike's work where
[SPEAKER_02]: do you rate that because I noticed that
you know exotic Mike gets a lot of praise
[SPEAKER_02]: from a lot of people but I've also had a
lot of friends like people I know in real
[SPEAKER_02]: life I've seen it myself they grow the
gear out and there's a surprisingly large
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of Hermes in the gear you know I'm
probably gonna cop some heat for that but
[SPEAKER_02]: you know where do you find his work is
this just an acceptable risk when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing out these types of genetics and
where do you rate exotic genetics in
[SPEAKER_03]: general yeah so from from Mike I've used
the cooking cream cut which is you know
[SPEAKER_03]: that that cup winning cut and so I've used
that one it's the hash monster people love
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's been a lot of requests lately
from people for for plants that will wash
[SPEAKER_03]: well and everybody knows that that plant
washes really well so I know that if we
[SPEAKER_03]: cross it they know the result will be just
that as far as they like kind of where I
[SPEAKER_03]: rate Mike and Mike's work one I've met
Mike I've spent time with Mike Mike is a
[SPEAKER_03]: really really solid person it's like super
humble really really good guy and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not gonna please everyone in terms
of there being some intersex expression in
[SPEAKER_03]: the work I'm not surprised he works with a
lot of different plants there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: cookie stuff in there even some of the
sherb stuff and whatnot is in there and he
[SPEAKER_03]: does a lot of male female regular stuff I
think he's about to drop a feminized line
[SPEAKER_03]: which would be his first one and so I
think that you know from doing that
[SPEAKER_03]: standard male female you run the risk of
seeing some of that intersex expression I
[SPEAKER_03]: do know though that that there's people
that are like super fanatical about his
[SPEAKER_03]: work he's got a lot of people that find
gear in there that they just love and it
[SPEAKER_03]: may just be that that they find you know
some intersex expression but they find
[SPEAKER_03]: some cuttings that they're like yeah this
one will work and then they run with it in
[SPEAKER_03]: that regard I think it's fine Mike charges
what I consider to be a reasonable price
[SPEAKER_03]: for his seeds so if you're gonna find some
intersex expressions I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the world because the prices he
keeps the prices very very reasonable if
[SPEAKER_03]: you charge a ton of money and the work is
unstable I think that's kind of where like
[SPEAKER_03]: I would draw the line personally and I
also know that you know he's he's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely willing to like work with
people I think if people have issues and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot I don't think it's any issue
replacing it or being communicative like
[SPEAKER_03]: if he's had problems with certain lines
which I don't know that he has had a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: number of issues like as far as like with
like the cookies guys where they just had
[SPEAKER_03]: to like disappear and some other people
that whatever I don't feel like naming
[SPEAKER_03]: right now where they kind of just
disappeared for a while and popped back up
[SPEAKER_03]: with a new line so I rate I rate Mike
pretty well and most mostly because just
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent time with him and he could have
a huge ego and he could kind of be an
[SPEAKER_03]: asshole if he wanted to be but he's not
he's like well he's one of the most decent
[SPEAKER_03]: people you're gonna meet in this business
so that goes a long way with with me like
[SPEAKER_03]: I said and I think he's pretty transparent
with people about the work that he's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: so can we expect to see you working with
any seed banks going forward and if so
[SPEAKER_02]: which ones like what would be important to
you about if you're gonna be dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: a seed bank how would you want to go about
establishing that type of relationship
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah that's I mean that's tricky to be
honest I don't really know that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what I want to do I've worked with one
seed bank before in a limited capacity
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not really something that's like kind
of front and center for me I have enough
[SPEAKER_03]: people that are like interested in my work
that I don't really need to do that and I
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of am cultivating a different type of
model than other breeders like I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: really looking to sell on a smaller scale
to just like you know all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: people and I mean that's that is what the
seed banks do I do get requests from
[SPEAKER_03]: people to list with certain seed banks but
there there's some good ones and I've you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I've seen some people that have
worked with some of them before but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not really something that I'm really
actively kind of seeking out obviously the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest things to me would be just that it
they be stand up that they be trustworthy
[SPEAKER_03]: and they provide good customer service I
mean the last thing you want is someone
[SPEAKER_03]: having a problem with them that then
affects poor that reflects poorly on you
[SPEAKER_03]: for working with them and I'm sure you've
seen you know there have been some some
[SPEAKER_03]: fly-by-night seed banks or questionable
practices with some of them you know in
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of ways whether it's paying
vendors or you know not not delivering the
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriate seeds or you know tampering
with the seed packs or all kinds of things
[SPEAKER_03]: that have happened out there over the
years so they're you know they're some
[SPEAKER_03]: seed banks that friends of mine have had
good relationships with I know my buddy
[SPEAKER_03]: unknown profit has had a good relationship
with seeds here now I know my buddy green
[SPEAKER_03]: team has also had a good relationship with
them so you know that's somebody that if
[SPEAKER_03]: it lined out it would make sense but I'm
not sure that you know the work that I do
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily has kind of the commercial
profile that they might want and as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: like promoting I don't really do a lot of
promoting I just kind of post what I like
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know I just I don't really know
that I would be a good partner honestly
[SPEAKER_03]: for someone because I don't really care to
promote a whole lot if you looked at my
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram it's really just it's just me
just sharing flour and kind of thoughts on
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I like and mostly work that
we've been doing or you know promoting
[SPEAKER_03]: some of my friends in their work and you
know just really kind of taking what we
[SPEAKER_03]: had on the forum and just putting it on
Instagram not really trying to you know
[SPEAKER_03]: create a whole thing beyond that it's just
it just kind of is exactly what it is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like these are the flowers this is what
we're growing and I really use Instagram
[SPEAKER_03]: as kind of like a like a networking tool
to be able to talk to other people about
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I really like facility design I'm
interested in environmental I'm interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in lighting I'm interested in a lot of
these other factors and kind of just
[SPEAKER_03]: really improving that aspect of the
cultivation not so much for like you know
[SPEAKER_03]: buy these seeds and they're gonna be here
and they're dropping here it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: work to do all that it's a lot of time and
a lot of commitment I find that I have
[SPEAKER_03]: better relationships with some of the
larger farms and enough of my friends kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of run these facilities that I don't you
know they understand my work they
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate my work and so being able to
just kind of work with them enables me to
[SPEAKER_03]: still do what I want to do without having
to kind of deal with things on a smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: scale because there's a lot of blowback
that comes from also the people I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think people think about that I think they
just are excited to work with a seed bank
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't think about okay the customer
service they provide or you know this
[SPEAKER_03]: person this one person had an issue but
you're dealing with hundreds of people or
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of people so you know there's
issues that pop up and kind of like you
[SPEAKER_03]: said people have had issues with certain
breeders and whatnot and then it becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: like a whole online thing and it's more
energy than I'm then I think I currently
[SPEAKER_03]: want to you know extend in that direction
if somebody wanted to do like like a small
[SPEAKER_03]: amount in a limited drop or something I
would be inclined to do that but not
[SPEAKER_03]: really like a full commitment to say like
yeah I'm gonna keep promoting and do all
[SPEAKER_03]: that stuff I've seen people kind of get
upset with with seed producers too for not
[SPEAKER_03]: promoting and not tagging them properly
and reposting and all I don't I don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to get into all that's a big it's just too
much to me would mostly be like hey if you
[SPEAKER_03]: like my work great you can carry it if you
don't care to carry it don't carry it it's
[SPEAKER_03]: totally fine and yeah but I know like I
said I know a nonprofit has had a good
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship with seeds here now and my
buddy from green team as well and a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: other people that I know so probably would
lean would lean towards work working with
[SPEAKER_02]: them if that was the case yeah cool I mean
it makes sense right so I think we're now
[SPEAKER_02]: on to our last couple of questions before
we get to the rapid-fire ones at the end
[SPEAKER_02]: so a pertinent question I ask all the
guests what is your preferred style of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and by that I mean are you an
organic or more of a synthetic guy how do
[SPEAKER_03]: you do it so for outdoor cultivation I
mean number one I when it comes to like
[SPEAKER_03]: the organic versus synthetics I don't
really draw a hard and fast line I think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's products from both sides that
really make sense I know there's people
[SPEAKER_03]: running like no till or low till organic
gardens with amendments and worms and they
[SPEAKER_03]: leave the leaves and they do all that and
that's dope but indoor that never made any
[SPEAKER_03]: sense to me I grew up indoor cultivating
so to me it's always been you know
[SPEAKER_03]: initially was bottled nutrients and then
it was salts just to be able to get the
[SPEAKER_03]: cost down and at the end of the day like I
never really noticed a huge decrease in
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality I have done like fully organic
like amended soil and you know I actually
[SPEAKER_03]: like to do that for Fino hunts I think it
really gives the plants an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_03]: pull what they want from that but when you
try and maintain this soil and do all that
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's indoors it kind of becomes a pain
you need a lot more space outdoor yeah the
[SPEAKER_03]: organic soil like fish emulsions all that
stuff I've always been a big proponent of
[SPEAKER_03]: that style of gardening for the outdoor
plants I think that they love it I think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's really something really really
special about being able to cultivate
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors I love it that's definitely
something that you know that I appreciate
[SPEAKER_03]: about having the chance to spend in NorCal
is all those years being able to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors in spite of the fires and
everything else for indoor I definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: prefer cocoa usually is the preferred
medium I have a lot of experience in
[SPEAKER_03]: rockwool as well rockwool is just cleaner
but I kind of like I appreciate cocoa I
[SPEAKER_03]: find it to be kind of like an in-between
between like rockwool or some kind of you
[SPEAKER_03]: know soilless medium or you know I don't
know amended soil or whatever it might be
[SPEAKER_03]: a pro mix or whatever that might be with
Pete with Pete and whatnot so I would
[SPEAKER_03]: probably say my favorite over the years
has been cocoa I find that you know I can
[SPEAKER_03]: grow really large plants in there multiple
irrigations per day and for years and
[SPEAKER_03]: years and years it was house and gardens
house and garden nutrients which I really
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciated and you know now I find you
know you can use floor reflects you can
[SPEAKER_03]: use veg bloom you can use all these
products really a lot of people and this
[SPEAKER_03]: is friendly advice to anyone who's
listening a lot of people are getting
[SPEAKER_03]: taxed on their nutrients at the end of the
day the nutrients are just one component
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't buy your way out of hard work so
all the equipment all the tools all the
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer whatever you you're spending
all this money but if you're not actually
[SPEAKER_03]: doing the work I would take a low-tech
garden with hard work over a garden with
[SPEAKER_03]: all expensive bottle nutrients and whatnot
it's just it doesn't make any sense if
[SPEAKER_03]: people are listening don't pay for water
buy salt if you're gonna do that and if
[SPEAKER_02]: not buy amendments and mix your own soil
yeah really solid advice so do you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite product you'd like to plug it all
um that's a good question I would say as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as a favorite product I don't really
think I'm loyal to anybody at this point I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean there's some lighting companies that
are pretty decent it's I mean god I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't know I mean I would say
man yeah I really don't know I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: there's there's some products that I've
used but no one that I would really
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend off top I would tell people you
know to avoid Gavita I could tell people
[SPEAKER_03]: what to avoid more than anything do it do
it yeah I would say avoid Gavita avoid
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid advanced nutrients avoid water-based
nutrients if you don't need them like
[SPEAKER_03]: literally don't buy anything that's that's
mixed with water buy fluoroflex because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's cheap if you want foliar if you need
to to supplement it look at what the
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture industry is doing and that's
you know stop buying something just
[SPEAKER_03]: because it has a fancy package on it I
mean JR Peters has a product called stem
[SPEAKER_03]: very inexpensive tons of micronutrients
but if it was bottled by advanced it would
[SPEAKER_03]: cost like five times as much ten times as
much yeah I would say you know look look
[SPEAKER_03]: into the LEDs and you know compare the
compare the different technologies that
[SPEAKER_03]: are out there there's a lot of people on
Instagram right now giving a lot of good
[SPEAKER_03]: information on LEDs and you know feel free
to reach out to the people and ask and
[SPEAKER_03]: learn you know and see learn you know
about the value of an adjustable spectrum
[SPEAKER_03]: light and look at you know the CMH's you
know and consider consider you know how
[SPEAKER_03]: you're operating your garden how you're
setting it up and yeah cleanliness you
[SPEAKER_03]: know probably if I was gonna plug a
product there would probably be bleach or
[SPEAKER_03]: something of the sort because cleaning is
fundamental people do not want to clean
[SPEAKER_03]: they seem to forget that we're basically
like housekeepers and janitors for plants
[SPEAKER_03]: at this point so keep it clean and yeah I
don't know I would say there's there's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely companies that are worth
avoiding out there that would not be worth
[SPEAKER_02]: messing with and yeah yeah I don't know
good call so just to wrap up our kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing questions do you have any growing
tips for the listeners or I guess maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: more specifically do you commonly see
people making certain mistakes with
[SPEAKER_02]: growing what's the mistake you see people
commonly doing um common mistakes
[SPEAKER_03]: overfeeding is a common mistake trying to
buy their way out of out of a problem that
[SPEAKER_03]: they created there is no solution to hard
work pay attention be diligent don't do
[SPEAKER_03]: something when it's convenient for you do
it when the plant needs it when you build
[SPEAKER_03]: your systems and you are designing a space
consider all the various factors think
[SPEAKER_03]: about where you're going and not kind of
what you can afford right now and where
[SPEAKER_03]: you are and so as you design as you buy as
you build think about all of that and
[SPEAKER_03]: prioritize the plant like I said no amount
of automation no amount of cameras or
[SPEAKER_03]: sensors or this that and the other is a
replacement for actually having experience
[SPEAKER_03]: with the plant there's a lot of people
that have you know horticulture degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot they think that they know better
than the plant they think that they can
[SPEAKER_03]: look at a chart and or meter readings and
this and that and the other and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that actually is what's happening
it's not when you look at the plant if you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't tell what's happening you have not
spent enough time with it I mean I can if
[SPEAKER_03]: you walk into a room and it feels wrong if
it smells wrong if the leaf feels wrong if
[SPEAKER_03]: the if the structure on the leaf looks off
if the general like the general shape form
[SPEAKER_03]: or kind of like the stance of the plant is
off something is wrong in your room and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think a lot of people they over like their
gardens they overfeed their gardens like
[SPEAKER_03]: they do too much and pay attention not all
strains are the same not all cultivars
[SPEAKER_03]: want the same thing so think about that
when you're setting up your garden if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to design something to be able to
grow multiple different varieties make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure you can have different feeds on each
bench or each table and keep it really
[SPEAKER_03]: really clean you know I think a big
mistake that people make is like they you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I mean you're only gonna get what you
put into it that's all you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_03]: out of it if there's no like I can tell
when a person has neglected their garden
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've had people watch my garden before
and I can tell like they just watered it
[SPEAKER_03]: right before I got back and the plants you
know have a little bit of curl on the leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: or a little bit you know they're gonna dry
back and they're gonna burn and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: care what they said I know I know exactly
what they did but yeah my biggest advice
[SPEAKER_03]: would probably be just you know don't be
afraid to experiment but don't change too
[SPEAKER_03]: many variables at once either like you
won't know what actually caused the effect
[SPEAKER_03]: be patient and think about what you're
doing think about whether or not you're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to learn to cultivate a specific
variety think about whether you're trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to get experience with different equipment
think about you know whether you're happy
[SPEAKER_03]: with you know B grade buds and when it
comes down to harvesting and drying and
[SPEAKER_03]: curing like give it the attention that it
deserves when you run something and put
[SPEAKER_03]: that much time into something and you
don't cure it properly you don't store it
[SPEAKER_03]: properly like you're wasting your time
you're never gonna see the full potential
[SPEAKER_03]: of that plant and yeah I would just say
just you know be diligent be thoughtful
[SPEAKER_03]: and pay attention you know care and the
more you care the better the better your
[SPEAKER_03]: garden will turn out and don't be afraid
you know to ask questions don't be afraid
[SPEAKER_03]: to reach out to people you'd be surprised
especially nowadays how helpful some
[SPEAKER_03]: people will be like I'm not saying that
inspector is gonna answer your message if
[SPEAKER_03]: you ask but he might and you know I think
a lot of people too they they want to they
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be great they're afraid they're
afraid to make mistakes and understand
[SPEAKER_03]: that all of us made mistakes all of us
have ruined a bats all of us have flooded
[SPEAKER_03]: a room or you know inserted a bulb
improperly or whatever it might be all of
[SPEAKER_03]: us have done it and we've done it multiple
times and be diligent with your IPM be
[SPEAKER_03]: diligent if you if you think it doesn't
matter and you start taking a day here a
[SPEAKER_03]: day there and skipping this or skipping
that I promise you it's gonna bite you and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's gonna be months of cleanup and you
that a little bit of time that you
[SPEAKER_03]: neglected is gonna come back to bite you
in the ass every single time you can
[SPEAKER_03]: always look back and see where you were
lazy and it will come back and bite you
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah some phenomenally solid advice right
there for all the growers looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve their game a bit so last question
before our little quick fire round we can
[SPEAKER_02]: see that there are more and more states
coming online regularly and we can also
[SPEAKER_02]: see that it's really hard to find good
flour in the majority of these states like
[SPEAKER_02]: for example you know in on the East Coast
in places like Mass like I can only think
[SPEAKER_02]: of like two people where I'd be able to
get good flour from them and that's like
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Medical and then like ChemDog slash
that guy from Maine those guys obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: crushing it so I guess my question is for
people who are from these smaller states
[SPEAKER_02]: just coming online is really no
established scene and I know I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass has a bit more of an established
scene than most places but I digress if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're from a state where there's less of
an established scene it's hard to find
[SPEAKER_02]: good flour what are some tips for the kind
of communities in these places to just
[SPEAKER_02]: lift their game and produce better quality
flour and get up to scratch with the west
[SPEAKER_03]: coast for example well I'm gonna have kind
of a defeatist attitude I think about the
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational market at least out east for
a while this market is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: dominated by by the big players by the
people that have the deep pockets so if
[SPEAKER_03]: your goal is to try and produce a higher
grade quality flour I honestly think that
[SPEAKER_03]: the best you could hope for is probably
like a Cheesecake Factory level of flour
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's good but anybody who knows
something phenomenal something truly
[SPEAKER_03]: special will never be impressed by it and
the big reason why is because of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that goes into it in terms of
how it's harvested how long it sits it
[SPEAKER_03]: goes out for testing then it gets jarred
up then it goes and sits on the shelf
[SPEAKER_03]: there's just such a gap in between that
scene and when it actually hits the market
[SPEAKER_03]: that the flour is just gonna be like
degraded by the time a consumer actually
[SPEAKER_03]: gets it so if you're used to getting
something really phenomenal high-end it's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be really really tough as a producer
there are states that are more friendly I
[SPEAKER_03]: think Maine is one of those states that
seems to be that like smaller producers
[SPEAKER_03]: can kind of get more into the market there
so that might be worth considering I do
[SPEAKER_03]: think that you know try I mean if you
really really want and you're really
[SPEAKER_03]: really committed to actually producing for
the market like on the recreational side
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna have to raise some capital
and try and make a run of it and be
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to fight tooth and nail for you
know three four or five years and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know that there's a ton of people that are
willing to do that because the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: producers on the medical side of the
market they're not gonna want to make the
[SPEAKER_03]: transition a lot of people I saw that
happen in California not a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: have transitioned successfully through 64
a lot of people disappeared a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people are not made to exist in a
corporate structure they're just not built
[SPEAKER_03]: for it it's a whole different beast of a
situation and I also think to be
[SPEAKER_03]: completely blunt like the rent the amount
that people get paid by these facilities
[SPEAKER_03]: is not equivalent to what they were
earning so a lot of a lot of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: talented growers are not going to want to
work for these facilities and I guess a
[SPEAKER_03]: big thing is that like if you are a grower
are you capable of operating in a in a
[SPEAKER_03]: semi corporate environment because whether
you like it or not that's what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing you know you're analyzing costs
you're managing people you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_03]: you know unemployment and payroll and all
of this stuff that that's not why a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people got into it so I think you know I
think in a few years after all of this
[SPEAKER_03]: settles there will be an opportunity for
some of these smaller craft places to pop
[SPEAKER_03]: up and you know I'm very very much looking
forward to that because I just don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: that it should cost that amount of money
to and require that much security and that
[SPEAKER_03]: much tracking and all of these crazy
things to be able to you know grow an
[SPEAKER_03]: eight lighter and you know have a small I
mean the equivalent of a small craft
[SPEAKER_03]: brewery it just it shouldn't it shouldn't
be that much different from that in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of you know they don't have to have
security in front of their spaces they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to have cameras in every corner
they don't have to pay all these
[SPEAKER_03]: exorbitant taxes and they let them pop up
pretty much anywhere you know for for us
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it's hard I think for a lot of
guys to make that transition for a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people to make that transition if you can
get enough people on the same page you can
[SPEAKER_03]: try and make a run at it but if you're
looking to produce higher quality I mean I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't honestly think that we're gonna see
the level of the quality of flour that we
[SPEAKER_03]: saw in the medical days in California on
the rec market for a long time I think
[SPEAKER_03]: best case scenario a lot of the flour
that's on the market is B grade I think a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the oil that's on the market is
better because the oil is processed so
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly and then it doesn't get it's more
the BHO that they're making in California
[SPEAKER_03]: is an example from the fresh frozen
material it's a lot easier to preserve it
[SPEAKER_03]: and bring it to market in a stable state
where it still has a really really strong
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profile and still has a nice solid
effect if the flour isn't stored precisely
[SPEAKER_03]: all along the way before you get it it's
gonna be an inferior product I mean I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen shops in Oregon like that where it's
you know it's 80 degrees in there and
[SPEAKER_03]: they've got the jar sitting there in full
light and when you ask them you know if
[SPEAKER_03]: they understand about oxidation and
temperature and the terpenes you know and
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't they had no clue what I was
talking about so I think that you know for
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality scene on the East Coast I
think that there are people producing
[SPEAKER_03]: quality flour but I think a lot of them
are gonna stay medical a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna stay underground and I think there
probably are some facilities that are
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to produce higher grade flour but
at the end of the day a lot of the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are bankrolling these facilities
that's not really what matters to them
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just looking to grab market share
make revenue you know they just want to
[SPEAKER_03]: recoup their investment and potentially
flip their business hopefully you know
[SPEAKER_03]: California will see some brands that
survive and exist I know some people out
[SPEAKER_03]: there that are doing you know they're
fully intending to do good quality work
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think if a market could sustain that
it would be a larger market like
[SPEAKER_02]: California yeah of course and you just
raised a really interesting point that I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to touch on for a second there have
you ever met a bud tender who legitimately
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed you with their knowledge oh wow
no yeah even at archive I've met some
[SPEAKER_03]: people that were like knowledgeable you
know and they were pretty passionate but
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody that ever really impressed me with
their knowledge and this is no this is no
[SPEAKER_03]: disrespect to anyone but if you knew that
much about this if you were that
[SPEAKER_03]: passionate about this like is that really
where you would be like yeah like the
[SPEAKER_02]: reason why I bring it up is because I got
sent an email and there was some like a
[SPEAKER_02]: event like for is like the bud tender
awards or something and they were like oh
[SPEAKER_02]: would you would you like to come and
document it and obviously they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: realize I'm in Australia but more
importantly like all I was thinking to
[SPEAKER_02]: myself is like what would I be documenting
like the mediocrity like like yeah like
[SPEAKER_02]: I've I'm disappointed by bud tenders
consistently it's like just the most passe
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to do if you're superficially into
cannabis yeah I had I had to explain so I
[SPEAKER_03]: went into one dispensary I had to explain
to them I asked if they had any live resin
[SPEAKER_03]: and they said oh we've got this and I was
like well that that's co2 and they were
[SPEAKER_03]: like oh but yeah but it's live I was like
no no like I said that's not what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: asking about I said do you have any like
fresh frozen material like BHO extract I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: like that's the only way it would be like
that and I had to explain to them the
[SPEAKER_03]: difference and then one of them asked me
hey you know you know you know a lot about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis would like do you want a job here
and I'm not not to be rude I laughed but
[SPEAKER_03]: not not like that but only to say like no
like this is my life is my whole upside I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to get into it with them but
like you should know that you should know
[SPEAKER_03]: the difference between live resin and
butter and sugar and wax and BHO and co2
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really not that complicated like all
you need to do is care to educate people
[SPEAKER_03]: but the reality is like I said about the
companies that are running these places
[SPEAKER_03]: the bar is so low they pay so little they
care so little about the training and kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of helping build these people up just like
most companies they don't really care
[SPEAKER_03]: about building up their employees why
would they care so they you know
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately most people that come in
what if you've listened all they say is
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the highest THC thing you have for
the least amount of money that's literally
[SPEAKER_03]: what people are interested in like yeah
that that's it you know the test results
[SPEAKER_03]: are a whole nother thing you know that's
like I mean some states are more strict
[SPEAKER_03]: than others but at the end of the day you
know there's been stories you know out of
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington and other places with labs
completely faking test results and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of unfortunate like we live in a THC
kind of dominant society people really
[SPEAKER_03]: just only care about the majority of the
customers that come in just care about the
[SPEAKER_03]: THC level you know and if it's 30% it
sells faster if it's 25 it sells fast if
[SPEAKER_03]: it sells 20 great below 20 they're not
super interested yeah it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting right I remember hearing that
one of the testing companies I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: remember who it was not even if I
remembered I probably wouldn't want to say
[SPEAKER_02]: the name but they were like you know you'd
pay for the test and then you'd also pay a
[SPEAKER_02]: little extra fee if you wanted it to test
over like you know 26 or something I was
[SPEAKER_03]: just like oh yeah cool cool oh yeah oh
yeah that's I mean people people have
[SPEAKER_03]: shopped around for testing companies like
to see who will test higher because they
[SPEAKER_03]: know that they'll they'll get a higher
ticket for that yeah that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting but also sad but not
unexpected given where we're at anyway on
[SPEAKER_02]: to our last little run of questions what I
like to call the quickfire questions so
[SPEAKER_02]: these ones you know feel free to answer
them as quickly or as long as you'd like
[SPEAKER_02]: first one what's your favorite weed that
you've ever smoked wow probably this the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cali mist we used to get in San Diego in
like early 2001 2002 wow yeah that that
[SPEAKER_03]: sounds like a really nice throwback yeah
it was phenomenal it was beautiful you
[SPEAKER_03]: could smell it in the air no matter if
somebody was smoking it wherever they were
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking it you could it was distinct it
had an incredible high that was super
[SPEAKER_03]: clear you felt lifted but clear no no
tiredness no anything to it really really
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful and then the other one was
honestly some some Willie Nelson that they
[SPEAKER_03]: had at Harborside I used to vend to
Harborside and I went in there one time
[SPEAKER_03]: and they had bought a pound of it and I
got I think they paid like six or seven
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand for it at the time and when
pounds of sour were going for 36 34
[SPEAKER_03]: significant but they gave me some of it
and the high from that was phenomenal I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean really really really special flower
it never made the shelf they split it up
[SPEAKER_02]: amongst themselves back there interesting
stuff okay so on the opposite end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum what's the worst weed you've ever
smoked and the follow-up is what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: worst weed that you've smoked that somehow
got commercial traction and other people
[SPEAKER_03]: seemingly thought it was pretty good wow
the worst weed that I've ever smoked was
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the brick weed I smoked in Miami
when I was like 16 since then I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: like no I won't do that the worst weed
that's gained commercial traction is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the Mac or the purple punch
either one of those yeah to two contenders
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've heard before actually no we
haven't heard the Mac we've heard purple
[SPEAKER_02]: punch but they go a new one bring a Mac to
the the worst commercial one but I see
[SPEAKER_02]: where the merit is so the next one is if
you're stranded on a desert island you can
[SPEAKER_02]: only take three strains with you what
three are you gonna take Wow probably the
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem D probably the TK and probably like
the lavender or some something along that
[SPEAKER_03]: line of the old perps I'd probably say
because that would I mean I'm gonna miss
[SPEAKER_03]: the sour but I think I think if I combine
the 91 and the or if I can buy the TK and
[SPEAKER_03]: the D I could probably get something that
I like in there haha love it and you just
[SPEAKER_03]: wave goodbye to sativas at that point hey
I'm on an island everything's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: fine yeah lovely okay so the next one is
if you could have back one clone that you
[SPEAKER_02]: had lost or a clone that you'd wanted but
were just never able to get your hands on
[SPEAKER_03]: what one would it be Wow hmm probably that
lavender honestly I just have a fine space
[SPEAKER_03]: for it I've never haven't had anything
like it in my garden since it would
[SPEAKER_02]: probably be that that lavender yeah it's a
really special plan I've been lucky enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to smoke some grown out by Duke
and it's very very memorable nice lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: indeed so on to our very last question if
you could go back in time to any place any
[SPEAKER_02]: time frame throughout all of history to
presumably get some seeds or a clone where
[SPEAKER_03]: and when would you go Wow man hmm probably
Columbia I think I think that a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting work has come out of there and
it would have to be before we started
[SPEAKER_03]: traveling around the world and polluting
the genetic gene pool probably some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombian and if not hmm if not the
Colombian some of the Asian stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: something something out in Thailand or
Cambodia or Laos I think would be really
[SPEAKER_03]: really phenomenal flower all things being
equal so I'd probably aim aim towards one
[SPEAKER_03]: of those both kind of with the same
intention really looking for something
[SPEAKER_03]: with an incredibly like psychedelic
uplifting type I yeah fantastic sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: like something I would consider doing so
with all that being said do you have any
[SPEAKER_03]: shout outs or comments you'd like to make
I would say if anything I just want to
[SPEAKER_03]: shout out all my friends I really
appreciate them I'm super grateful for
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that they've done for me over
the years good friend of mine who really
[SPEAKER_03]: helped me a whole lot when I landed in
Oakland and didn't know anybody and didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have anything and really looked out for me
and knew a lot about growing knew a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more about growing than I did at the time
and now you know he calls me for advice
[SPEAKER_03]: but still one of one of my greatest
friends and I super appreciate him and
[SPEAKER_03]: then my buddies from IC mag who I would
not be here without my buddy Stoney my
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy frost boss my buddy profit my buddy
nor cow my buddy DZ just all the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that I kind of came up with and that made
opportunities for me and gave me a chance
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was just trying to make a run of it
out West a lot of these guys are born and
[SPEAKER_03]: raised out here and you know they didn't
have to extend any hospitality or do
[SPEAKER_03]: anything of the sort but they definitely
gave me a lot of opportunity and a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of my friends from Chicago who were
basically the reason that I thought that
[SPEAKER_03]: this was possible and were the ones that
it convinced me to come back to the West
[SPEAKER_03]: Coast after I tried the first time and it
didn't work out and gave me an opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of just plugged me with with the
right people and you know we're always
[SPEAKER_03]: there to kind of help me even when I
couldn't afford to pay them just really
[SPEAKER_03]: you know super grateful and honestly for
my mother and my grandmother who in spite
[SPEAKER_03]: of me being completely insane in their
eyes have always supported me and
[SPEAKER_03]: encouraged me and never told me that I was
incapable of doing something and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the best advice that I would give
anybody who's actually taking the time to
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to this is that you are completely
capable of doing it if you of whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: is that you want to achieve if you're
willing to apply and work and work and
[SPEAKER_03]: single-mindedly focus on something and be
be good people don't let people take
[SPEAKER_03]: advantage of you and give give what you
get some really really really really solid
[SPEAKER_02]: advice there so just again a big thank you
