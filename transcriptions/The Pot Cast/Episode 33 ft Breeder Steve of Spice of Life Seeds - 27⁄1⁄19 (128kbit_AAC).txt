[SPEAKER_01]: seeds only place to get your addiction
filled best in the game Guarantee on
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfaction not just germination and
speaking of best in the game for 20
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia organic gardening solutions
another two killers go check them out on
[SPEAKER_01]: this episode we are thankful to be talking
to the man on the million seed feno hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: himself Brita Steve here to talk about
terroir genetics history and what he's up
[SPEAKER_02]: to down in South America let's get into it
alrighty so a big thank you and welcome to
[SPEAKER_02]: another veteran of the scene the man
behind so many famous strains Brita Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks so much for joining us thanks for
having me and thanks for your hospitality
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was in your neck of the woods this
year yeah no problem at all so first
[SPEAKER_02]: question we've been starting the
interviews off with lately what are you
[SPEAKER_02]: currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: well a little selection I had just rolled
up a bud of skunk number one for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: nostalgic smoke and it reminds me even the
feel in your fingers breaking up skunk it
[SPEAKER_00]: has a feel you know I find like it's a
very soft silky even though it's a tight
[SPEAKER_00]: snug maybe a tight snug it still breaks up
in your fingers like it if with my eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: closed sometimes I think I would know that
was skunk number one just because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: feel of the bud yeah no I can kind of
relate to that I've never tried a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of skunks but I think I know what
you mean it's kind of velvety feeling yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: okay well my first question would be
what's your opinion on terms of the skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: now versus when you were first
experiencing it you know it's an old
[SPEAKER_00]: standby and it's such a billboard building
block of everything out there were many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things out there and I just like I
found in the last couple years that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been going back to strains I remember from
when I was younger and just starting out
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 years ago and I think I'm still kind of
nostalgic for a taste of that old northern
[SPEAKER_00]: lights or some skunk number one or
something like they are classics for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason you know and I sure love trying the
latest and greatest from everybody too but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a reason those ones are still
around is there you know they have
[SPEAKER_02]: character yeah of course and have you
personally noted any kind of variation
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years because I think that's the
comment that often gets thrown around yes
[SPEAKER_00]: sir the NLIC today isn't as it's just not
the same as the first ones I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to there's there's some
similarities but there's some definite
[SPEAKER_00]: differences and you know within any
population there's some variation so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can imagine how many northern light seeds
got sold over the years and spread around
[SPEAKER_00]: from Seattle before they were even being
sold in seed companies you know so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of variation even within NL5
there would still be a lot of you know
[SPEAKER_02]: recognizable but different of course and
so do you think that the NL at least maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll say NL5 just so we've got a little
more of a talking point do you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it was a line which had variation
even when it was originally released or it
[SPEAKER_00]: was more of like a clone type of thing I
think there was a fairly stable line and
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think it you know clones can
have sports which is mutations through
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings which is why you know Pinot Gris
Pinot Blanc and Pinot Noir were all the
[SPEAKER_00]: same seedling at one point and they share
the exact same chromosomes but there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation in the cuttings which led to the
other two they're not even sure which was
[SPEAKER_00]: the first one in that case but I mean with
northern lights that could be the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where you you get some clonal
variation over time but mostly you don't a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone is a clone in most cases you know it
would take millennia for some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: tweaks happened like they haven't been a
fair over time the you know selecting from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed when you grow a pack of seed you
always have one favorite of the bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you have two favorites but they're
never all absolutely unmistakably the same
[SPEAKER_00]: you know regardless how stable the line
may be it's not uniform like a tray of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones so the everybody can pick a little
different one and of course every
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that it's grown is different
even different waters source anything can
[SPEAKER_00]: change like you can really taste the
difference between BC Hydro and Ontario
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydro largely because of the hard and soft
water so I mean it's the environment is
[SPEAKER_00]: half the genetic is half of what you end
up with but among the you know within the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment there's lots of variation and
within the genetic there's at least a
[SPEAKER_02]: little variation yeah certainly and you
just touched on a topic I always love to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about but rarely we get to genetic
drift do you believe that it exists the
[SPEAKER_02]: consensus we've heard so far is a lot of
people don't think it exists within
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis but you kind of just hinted that
you think it may well if if it does it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very slow process you know so
there's some clones that have you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know even have been around for 30
years so I do I see a massive change in
[SPEAKER_00]: them not a massive change but sometimes
there's some slippage or the introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: of a virus or something you know where the
like with grapefruit grapefruit was a
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting I got in 94 and it had no name it
was called the people I got it from called
[SPEAKER_00]: it the only thing worth growing so and I
always thought they picked it too early
[SPEAKER_00]: because I thought their bud was sweet but
it was always really long red hair and
[SPEAKER_00]: just not quite finished so I said I really
want to get some clones of this and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it out and it was I got some in the
spring my first year in Vancouver and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them out on my balcony and flowered like
20 of them out there I kept one under a
[SPEAKER_00]: light in my closet the veg when I my first
place in DC right after university and it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled like as it ripened and got truly
ripe well beyond the long orange hairs all
[SPEAKER_00]: over it once it started to swell up and
you have swollen calyxes and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it was just like scratching and a
ruby red I called it sweet pink grapefruit
[SPEAKER_00]: because it when it really finishes it's
got unmistakable you know sweet pink
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit smell and it carries into the
taste is a bit but not as much as in the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell the smell is really obviously sweet
pink grapefruit so it was really nice to
[SPEAKER_00]: find that but and I shared that cutting
far and wide anybody that calls it
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit got it downstream from me
because I appended that name to that found
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting the but do I see different
versions of grapefruit from different
[SPEAKER_00]: corners for sure and some people I've
talked to been calling me see and if they
[SPEAKER_00]: could get one because the ones they've had
have gone to shit and mostly is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have tobacco mosaic virus whereas other
people that have had them the whole time
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're perfectly healthy so it can
pick up a problem on the way and in
[SPEAKER_00]: different hands even and then that gets
passed around and people think oh this is
[SPEAKER_00]: falling apart now and it can be from a
variety of factors but the but do I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna morph into a different looking
plant like you know noir and pinot blanc
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty extreme you know considering
they have the same genetics and the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics drift between those is not that
they weren't born from the same seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: but they had drift through cuttings and
and that's a mutation known as a sport I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see why it couldn't happen in
cannabis except for the reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: typically cannabis is an annual and people
like a vine vines are kept in cloned and
[SPEAKER_00]: passed on and so I think it's more
apparent in something that's been cloned
[SPEAKER_00]: over a thousand years rather than
something that's been cloned over ten you
[SPEAKER_00]: know yeah I think it would become much
more apparent over time those different
[SPEAKER_00]: clones but I think out the gate you know
you're not seeing genetic drift on cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: from a same mothers or growing those into
mothers and growing their cuttings and
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers like I think you could go quite a
few generations all things being equal not
[SPEAKER_00]: not including the introduction of a virus
or something that causes it to degrade you
[SPEAKER_02]: know yeah and I mean you bring up a really
interesting point there because I I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: remember where I read it but I believe it
said that there had actually not been any
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory confirmed cases of TMV and
cannabis and I was immediately suspect
[SPEAKER_02]: when I heard that like what do you think
of that claim well I don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory but from the the symptoms that
I've seen always described as TMV do seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to take down a plant whether it's actually
TMV or not I've never verified in a lab
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've seen most of us have seen those
leaves with the wavy yellow splotchy color
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants they cease to be healthy after
that you know so I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually TMV but I know the cannabis
community identifies typically they would
[SPEAKER_00]: identify that pathology you know TMV yeah
of course that's just what that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: think of as a and are we right beats me
I've never actually seen it under an
[SPEAKER_00]: electron microscope I am NOT the the guy
with the experience in the lab so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to learn something new if we can
dispel a myth with science that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: thing but do I know I don't know I haven't
seen I can't confirm or deny yeah I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: heck maybe if nothing else it's a good
reason to not have tobacco around cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants any excuse so something I wanted to
quickly clarify from the little story just
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier on you mentioned is it the case
that that cutting you got was what you
[SPEAKER_02]: refer to as I'm not sorry what you refer
to was it the case that that was
[SPEAKER_02]: grapefruit or the sweet pink grapefruit
because I believe if you look up the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic sweet pink grapefruit is listed as
grapefruit cross unknown strain well
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some truth to that because the
first plant though I definitely tagged SPG
[SPEAKER_00]: for sweet pink grapefruit and as I was
sharing it with people and showing them
[SPEAKER_00]: from the 19 bugs that I'd grown out there
was everybody was like wow that's super
[SPEAKER_00]: candy that's super sweet and it really had
a very sweet sweet flavor and the bag was
[SPEAKER_00]: unmistakably grapefruit so the first cross
I made with those was with a jolly rancher
[SPEAKER_00]: male and you haven't heard of that
probably maybe you have but it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual so that was the very first release
of spice of life was jolly rancher and it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually changed the name from the
original I had bred that in a creek near
[SPEAKER_00]: the house where I spent my formative years
I've never conceived that I grew up but
[SPEAKER_00]: the where I started growing my first five
years outdoors I would save a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of seed after the first couple attempts
and then I thought okay when I moved to BC
[SPEAKER_00]: I had I called it Medway madness because I
grew it at Medway Creek and I had my
[SPEAKER_00]: medway madness seeds and when I got to BC
I just had a few film canisters you know
[SPEAKER_00]: for personal use at that time I was always
people were always smoking my homegrown
[SPEAKER_00]: with me because I would never sell
anybody's a bud everybody would want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy some of my homegrown because it was a
exceptional but I wouldn't sell it because
[SPEAKER_00]: I said look you know this is exceptional
what am I gonna do with your money go
[SPEAKER_00]: replace it I can't so when it runs out
it's gone so I said the most I'll do is
[SPEAKER_00]: share let's share some with you when we
get together but I'll never sell it to you
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can't grow enough for everybody
and once I run out I can't replace it so I
[SPEAKER_00]: said once it's legal maybe we'll revisit
that but those seeds I just had because I
[SPEAKER_00]: made two or three film canisters probably
at that time and I had a one-page how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your own you know gorilla style as I
did and I would give anybody that was
[SPEAKER_00]: bugging me to buy a bud I'd say here I can
give you a one pager of instructions on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do it and I can give you 20 seeds
to go get started and when you get her
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out pass it along and show some
other people how to do it and give them
[SPEAKER_00]: some starting material you know so it was
just a straight hobby play is what I got
[SPEAKER_00]: into and then when I was moved to
Vancouver having been from London Ontario
[SPEAKER_00]: originally I used to go down to Mark
Emory's City Light bookstore and buy two
[SPEAKER_00]: live crew or high times or whatever the
government was prohibiting so I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like to support his civil disobedience
efforts and once he moved to Vancouver he
[SPEAKER_00]: just coincidentally was also in Vancouver
with hemp BC and he was selling I think
[SPEAKER_00]: three varieties of seeds and they were
northern lights northern light haze and
[SPEAKER_00]: northern light haze Hawaiian that DC seed
company brought over from sent to see if I
[SPEAKER_00]: recall and the police raided him and
busted him the first time for selling
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and I went down to see him the next
week or something I just popped in we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know each other very well or
anything but I said hey remember me I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into that pop rally and London and
blah blah blah I said I see you got busted
[SPEAKER_00]: selling seeds if you are gonna keep going
with it I'd like to donate film canister
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to you and I remember he peeled the
top off of him and said those are coconuts
[SPEAKER_00]: they're freaking coconuts because they
were really big seeds they were like small
[SPEAKER_00]: peas really they were fat seeds those
jolly ranchers so he said well what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call them and I said I said well I
call them Medway madness and we're like
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah nobody's gonna know what that isn't
big the Medway means nothing outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: London Ontario so I said I thought about
it a little bit and they're very tanky it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a tangy herb you know little fruity
and tangy in it but not overly sweet I
[SPEAKER_00]: said jolly rancher you know so we put
those first ones out as spice of life
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds jolly rancher and that jolly rancher
got the mail from that was pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: later or pollinated the sweet pink
grapefruit cutting and that first f1 of
[SPEAKER_00]: those was called sweet pink grapefruit so
they there's both a cutting and that first
[SPEAKER_00]: round of seeds that was called sweet pink
grapefruit and then the second time I
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed the grapefruit led to the sweet
skunk which remarkably has no skunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: the story's been told but I'll share it
with you again while I was in Vancouver my
[SPEAKER_00]: first order of business moving out there
was to collect every single head bang I
[SPEAKER_00]: could find and bring it and get seeds from
anywhere I could and just really look at
[SPEAKER_00]: everything because at the time BC was the
only province in Canada with nobody in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail for growing and I wasn't worried
about selling what I was growing I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to grow out a lot and look at it
and I had 1500 plants from seed in my
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard in the summer right in town they
would get to be a meter high or so before
[SPEAKER_00]: I really started thinning them out I mean
it was a bit crazy and I had 14 lights in
[SPEAKER_00]: the basement at that time so people and
I'd have a live music once a week and have
[SPEAKER_00]: big parties there it was just stupid but
the second time I had one of the guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: got cuttings from because anybody that was
selling cuttings I said I'll take some
[SPEAKER_00]: bring me some and he brought me two trees
one had an orange dash of spray paint on
[SPEAKER_00]: the side and the other nothing and he said
I think this one is big skunk I think this
[SPEAKER_00]: one is northern lights but he wasn't sure
and I'm like for fuck's sake she couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: just write an N on one of them or
something you know but anyway so I took
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants and I labeled them what he
thought they were as they grew out it
[SPEAKER_00]: later became apparent that they were
reversed and though but even worse he
[SPEAKER_00]: picked up these cuttings from one of the
trays the one that I thought was big skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: turned out to be a male and I had like 20
of these cuttings I'm like oh fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: great but but it had been growing in veg
so vigorously I was like wow well this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a real deep plant I was really loving the
plant and then when I saw it was a male I
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't loving it quite as much but I
thought well I'll kill most of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep one because it is super vigorous and
the stem smelled really had a gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma on the stem and so that you know
obviously in retrospect turned out to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the end all days but at the time I thought
it was a big skunk and I made a cross of
[SPEAKER_00]: it with a number of things every year
basically I was taken the best male I
[SPEAKER_00]: found out of my initial years of just
collecting all the females I could and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing them out side by side and then any
males I found I would usually toss but if
[SPEAKER_00]: it was outstanding for any reason I would
keep that male and let it hit a room of
[SPEAKER_00]: like my favorite five or favorite six
females going at the time so that was how
[SPEAKER_00]: the sweet skunk was done was that male NL
Hayes male on the sweet pink grapefruit
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting and when I brought it out in the
seed catalog and took it down town to MBC
[SPEAKER_00]: I was calling it big fruit which would
have been okay it should have just stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with big fruit but Mark was out of skunk
at the time and he said well because the
[SPEAKER_00]: father is a skunk pig bud he's like I'll
call it sweet skunk so he just changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: name on the catalog that was the only time
that happened where I released the seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: something and then they you know the
vendor changed the name and the catalog
[SPEAKER_00]: was just what was you know my ad space in
cannabis Canada magazine at the time so
[SPEAKER_00]: they just edited the name from big fruit
to sweet skunk so that sweet skunk name
[SPEAKER_00]: just stuck because that 's what it came
out with right away and when I grew it out
[SPEAKER_00]: what became famous as sweet skunk now was
the cutting of one particular recessive so
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out 500 of those f1s and 498 of
them looked like northern lights because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure the grapefruit cutting was
a really early version of northern lights
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy I got it from it had it 17 years
who got it from somebody else that had it
[SPEAKER_00]: about that long who brought it up from
Seattle and it was already old so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a several decades old cutting when I got
it and that was a long time ago now so I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it's probably 50 years old or
something if you think about it but when I
[SPEAKER_00]: grew them out it was mostly northern
lights looking plants really quite stable
[SPEAKER_00]: even the shocking we saw which really
confirms that I think it was a grapefruit
[SPEAKER_00]: was an early northern lights and then the
but the two recessives that showed up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room were like hazes and they were
moved to the corner they weren't obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: going to finish at the same time as most
of them so they got shoved to the corner
[SPEAKER_00]: and while they were very similar looking
haze type plants one of them was just if I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pick a favorite you know and I
would ask my friends to come down and rub
[SPEAKER_00]: them and not tell them what I think and I
say if you had to just pick one and these
[SPEAKER_00]: which one do you like more and everybody
picked the same one I like where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like I guess this one is just a little bit
sweeter smell you know and they were both
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional and and so that cutting I
shared it far and wide because you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people are really into protecting
cuttings and I was more of the mind like I
[SPEAKER_00]: hate to be the only guy with this bud I
would really like to see everywhere I go
[SPEAKER_00]: people pull this out you know so I really
wanted to make sure that you know I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of growers wouldn't want it because
it's 12 weeks to flower and they're used
[SPEAKER_00]: to it but I knew some of them would get to
the appreciation of it and go you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what even if you go 12 14 weeks it makes
up for it because of the stretch and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a pretty good yield of fluffy
sativa like buds if I can still say sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: without getting slapped the beauty of it
you know is it just smells gorgeous and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because it's a stretchy you can throw
that fucker into trays for rooting on 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours you don't have to keep the cloning
lights on just root them on 12 hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: then put those straight into flower like
six in a four or six by six a thirty six
[SPEAKER_00]: of them in a four by four area if you like
to grow lots of little ones if you put
[SPEAKER_00]: thirty six of them in a four by four area
you will have thirty six cricket bats you
[SPEAKER_00]: know they just they just stretch up a big
fluffy glorious stretchy buds and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just smell incredible so people when you
know when standard good indoor in town was
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 200 an ounce that would fetch 300 an
ounce according to my friends that were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling because they would be growing you
know grapefruit or trying to even think of
[SPEAKER_00]: what people were growing back there was a
lot of big but it was really a it was an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing time there were some people
growing some really fantastic herbs but
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the people aren't ever growing a
lot of fantastic herbs that's it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: kiss of death of popularity like at one
point the grapefruit perfect example it
[SPEAKER_00]: was highly sought after when it first was
showing up as really good quality product
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was tasty and visually appealing
and everybody's people that were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it commercially and exporting it doing a
good job we're making a good name for it
[SPEAKER_00]: but of course the cuttings get spread
around to everybody eventually and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes the lowest common denominator
because if everybody's growing it and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the case of Vancouver at the time the
Vietnamese were growing a lot of lower
[SPEAKER_00]: grade bud picking everything at six weeks
or whatever and just banging out and once
[SPEAKER_00]: though once that strain got out into the
wider world or that cutting it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: kiss of death because it was it started
out super popular and that would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: kiss of death because once it got popular
everybody's doing it and once everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it now it's the regs or the beasters
you know because it's not being done with
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to detail required to make it
special so when the first when i just give
[SPEAKER_00]: it out to a bunch of really good growers
because i want to see them grow it you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and i give it to beginners anybody
starting out i want to see them get
[SPEAKER_00]: growing some sweeter herb it helps but the
name gets dragged through the dirt when
[SPEAKER_00]: too much bad commercial gets attached to
it and then nobody wants to see it they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh yeah you know a few years later
once everybody would have it it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: be synonymous with shitty weed you know oh
no we don't want more grapefruit and then
[SPEAKER_00]: now that sort of flipped around again as
people are kind of missing the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors because everything's been on this
pungent kush kick for a while and very
[SPEAKER_00]: piney strong aromas and uh punchy herb but
like not necessarily really a pleasure to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke yeah yeah it's definitely
interesting we i think we've been on the
[SPEAKER_02]: fuel binge for a while now so to speak
with the ogs and all that variety is the
[SPEAKER_00]: spice of life as they say and uh i always
like i would i never had one that i
[SPEAKER_00]: thought oh that's the only thing i want to
smoke for the rest of my life you know i
[SPEAKER_00]: always say boy i sure want that in my
library or my cellar of jars for the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of my life i always want to
[SPEAKER_02]: have access to that flavor do i want it to
be described and i'm even um personally
[SPEAKER_02]: toying with the idea of maybe giving
raspberry marmite to a few people but i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: fearful of exactly what you said like just
becomes synonymous with shit weed that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens i mean it's cool it's still
good to get it out there because anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a chance to grow good weed if
they've got good genetics without them
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't even have a chance right yeah
so i like to get the genetics out there
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's always disheartening when you see
a piss poor job done of it and it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it reflects badly on you to some degree
because people think oh yeah you know i
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to this one young american kid
recently that works for a big pot company
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was on a conference call with some
other people and trying to explain how he
[SPEAKER_00]: was a real pot expert and whatnot and i
was like okay and he and he says so what
[SPEAKER_00]: strange did you breed and i was like well
like sweet tooth shishka berry and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: like sweet tooth isn't that the bee sters
and i'm cracking up i'm going that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: a frat boy that looks at boof pack says
you know not a grow expert if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow expert that's not what you say you'd
say oh that looks like this or you know
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you might have some valid input
but when you say isn't that just the bee
[SPEAKER_00]: sters i think that's the boof packs you
know shopping frat boys you know you just
[SPEAKER_00]: you just lost me as far as any credibility
with what you know about a strain you know
[SPEAKER_00]: if all you know is the bee sters because
you've just been looking at the shitty
[SPEAKER_02]: weed that people are selling you garbage
yeah it's it's crazy how many people who
[SPEAKER_02]: are just i call them professional smokers
and they think they're like you know like
[SPEAKER_02]: the guy you're talking to basically anyway
so what i wanted to touch back on for a
[SPEAKER_02]: sec was you mentioned sweet pink
grapefruit and the original grapefruit
[SPEAKER_02]: clone possibly being a northern lights
what do you think is the origins of that
[SPEAKER_02]: like just a worked afghani type of thing
that's what we've heard thrown around
[SPEAKER_00]: before definitely i mean beyond that i
have no idea but there's obviously a it's
[SPEAKER_00]: afghanica that's that's uh i don't know
what else exactly and i'm sure people do
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm sure it's already been sequenced and
explored it's probably in that uh philis
[SPEAKER_00]: philos yeah philis galaxy i bet you they
have it i mean i just haven't looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff lately i've not been keeping up i'm
just trying i've just spent the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years getting my ducks in a row to
get back into being able to breed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wide open field scenarios again and that's
really to me if i'm not doing selections
[SPEAKER_00]: and fields i'm not getting my money's
worth you know i have to pay too much to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it inside to get polluted results the
way i see it because if the plants become
[SPEAKER_00]: incapable to survive outside because
they've been living with crutches so long
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll never run again you know so i want
to have them you know we're the strong
[SPEAKER_00]: survive there's a nature can thin out a
lot of you and it really is a number game
[SPEAKER_00]: you know every time you're planting seeds
regardless of the source it's a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lottery so the more tickets you have the
better chance you have of winning and you
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't find you know out of a hundred
seeds you might find one twice as good as
[SPEAKER_00]: you found out of 10 but out of a million
seeds it might not be twice as good but
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's 10 better it's still vast
improvement you know so really the the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to start large numbers of seed and
grow them in the open exposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: elements is priceless as far as doing
selections it does have to work for you
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you're going to find out in a
hurry which ones can't stand up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: windstorm and if you're not worried about
that and you you're happy to stake all
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants that's fine but i may that may
be a condition for me if i need the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that stand up on their own two feet
because i'm not planning on staking a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand square kilometers of i want to
have plants that are resilient and when i
[SPEAKER_00]: started breeding in vancouver on a
full-time way i would do a selection a
[SPEAKER_00]: year outside and for a generation and then
i would do two generations selected
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors so before long the plants that i
was working with and the lines i was
[SPEAKER_00]: developing were great for indoors and most
people grew them indoors but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: still decent outdoor plants and and that
was always really neat to see for me
[SPEAKER_00]: because i'd always just grown in canada at
that point and but i would find amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical plants like out of seed from
barbedos i got what turned out to be
[SPEAKER_00]: original columbian gold that i've never
seen as pure since and i made two crops
[SPEAKER_00]: with those i had males and females and
stupidly i didn't keep a pure line of it
[SPEAKER_00]: because i thought oh nobody will ever want
these are 16 weeks and so i used um
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the same dad as the sweet skunk
to make a tropical treat line i had
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical treat one and two and then i used
the pollen from the columbian gold on a
[SPEAKER_00]: dutch tree for and i believe that was
tropical treat one and the other one was
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical treat two and then in switzerland
later i may i used uh i'd grown them out a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple lines and crossed them later with
sweets gunk and shishka berry with each of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines and called those tropicana one
and two and i think richard from heaven
[SPEAKER_00]: stairway cornered the market on those but
it was really amazing to me even from the
[SPEAKER_00]: first tropical treats was to see customers
that ordered these plants through the
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine back then and grew them out in
northern australia or hawaii or in mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: or palm springs or somewhere infinitely
warmer than where i was and they could see
[SPEAKER_00]: the real potential like i would see these
plants as four foot skinny little things
[SPEAKER_00]: under lights and then i would get back the
customer photos of guys with these 16 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: monsters just like holy shit you know it
was so cool to see that and the you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really been amazing you know and
ourselves included like with online
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community we've made friends all
over the world that we share this you know
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing if somewhat controversial hobby
and we've been much maligned and
[SPEAKER_00]: persecuted for it and we grin and bear it
and we keep pushing onwards and even with
[SPEAKER_00]: uh you know when we put our personal lives
at risk and at stake and um i have nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: but respect for the people doing it right
that's for sure yeah definitely i mean
[SPEAKER_02]: let's just take a step back for a moment
and fill everyone in because i'm sure a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people are hugely interested in
what you're doing right now as i am what
[SPEAKER_02]: was it that first inspired you to start
thinking about moving down south and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the big things you're doing now well um i
had basically taken a sabbatical from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis work as i was getting really fed
up with the industry and there was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a bit of a pogrom happening where we
were working in switzerland so we just
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to close up shop and uh take some
time to reevaluate what we're doing and i
[SPEAKER_00]: decided you know what i was a lot of the
seed retailers because i never did retail
[SPEAKER_00]: i was always just selling mainly to
distributors even who would then sell to
[SPEAKER_00]: shops and sometimes the shop would or
shops would order directly maybe in a
[SPEAKER_00]: country where there wasn't a distributor
um so i really just operated on the
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale level with them and that degree
of insulation was really good for peace of
[SPEAKER_00]: mind and security but on the other hand i
started having to deal with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: fuckery in people putting you know
starting to print fake packs and putting
[SPEAKER_00]: other seeds in it or their cheap version
of it or whatever just like i am so and i
[SPEAKER_00]: got and and selling knockoffs of them from
other unscrupulous seed companies and then
[SPEAKER_00]: i got to be at one point i had a look
right around then when shit was getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a real headache and i was like there's
not a single one of my customers left that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't sell knockoffs of my seeds on the
next page why the fuck am i doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just you know i said until you've got
some protection like any other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder i'm going halfway around the world
building out facilities for indoors field
[SPEAKER_00]: selections greenhouse production without
selling all the pot by the ton all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time if i just grew grass for sale of
weight it would have been easy quiet made
[SPEAKER_00]: more money but i was always into how much
can i roll back into r and d because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was to me it was just that's my addiction
is the r and d i want to keep growing that
[SPEAKER_00]: having some money is good but it's not to
be all an end all for me maybe for other
[SPEAKER_00]: people that's different and that's their
business and i don't care i don't judge
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that just wants to grow for weight
but for me i just want to sprout seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: i want to sprout them consecutively
generation after generation and see the
[SPEAKER_00]: development towards the ideal of the
examples that i find most attractive and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you can you know you're only in
charge of your own taste you know so if
[SPEAKER_00]: people like stuff you know that is
calibrated to my taste that's great then
[SPEAKER_00]: we were on the same page if not whatever
you breed your other ones i don't it's to
[SPEAKER_00]: their own there's absolutely there's no
right or wrong when it comes to your
[SPEAKER_00]: palate because your palate is your palate
and i find um you know whether i'm reading
[SPEAKER_00]: wine reviewers sometimes i'll find ones
though they like wines i don't like and
[SPEAKER_00]: that guy always likes wines i do like so
maybe i'll follow what he's doing better
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's the same with with grass some
breeders are going to breed stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: appeals to certain people and other people
are going to be more attracted to stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: from other breeders but i think overall
you know it's really fun it's it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like music almost it's like there's music
but how many kinds of music are there you
[SPEAKER_00]: know even with in one genre of music which
is your favorite band you know so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really a expression so we find the
herbs that appeal to us the most and i
[SPEAKER_00]: just feel privileged to have uh indulged
myself so long in doing so and having took
[SPEAKER_00]: a long break from it which my children
were young at the time too and i wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: them to have a you know non-controversial
upbringing as i was leaving europe and
[SPEAKER_00]: going back to the dark ages and and that
worked out fine i'd do something else i
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoyed and it was still the whole
time so it was really not a huge sacrifice
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a break from the industry all that
time and as i watched the various programs
[SPEAKER_00]: roll out in the canadian regime i would
read through them the day they came out
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it was mmar mmpr acmpr and then
the cannabis act and i would lose interest
[SPEAKER_00]: by the time i read them because i would
think the mmar came out when i was gone i
[SPEAKER_00]: think so it would never really uh even
while i was gone the mmpr came out i
[SPEAKER_00]: remember reading it on my computer in
switzerland and i was looking at do i want
[SPEAKER_00]: to come back and set this up and by the
time i'd read through it i was like now
[SPEAKER_00]: this is designed to fail this is a joke
and there's no way i'd want to work under
[SPEAKER_00]: those conditions and if i can't grow
outside or make hash fuck i can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: bothered and uh so so it had zero appeal
to me to build a jail to work in you know
[SPEAKER_00]: so the then the acmpr came out and it
still didn't allow an outdoor cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: so it still lacked interest for me and it
was softer than the mmpr but it was still
[SPEAKER_00]: nonsensical and now the latest the
cannabis act that came out october 17th
[SPEAKER_00]: this year has allowed open the door for
outdoor applications so now it's starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to get more interesting so i'm having a
serious thought about canada but about
[SPEAKER_00]: five years ago even one of my friends that
was a an academic he'd been really trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get me interested in doing an mmpr and
i kept saying no no no no no i don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to bother with this shit let's wait till
we see something better and so we ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: making a company just for studying the
opportunity and on the different uh
[SPEAKER_00]: regimes around the world and we really
were just doing our homework and and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping our eye open and staying patient
and when i saw the first draft of the
[SPEAKER_00]: columbian regs come out it was like they
read the mmpr took a black marker to most
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and cut it down to 12 pages so it
was like oh this is way better you know
[SPEAKER_00]: this has some appeal and it involved
outdoor as an option and and it ticked off
[SPEAKER_00]: the boxes because i'd always wanted to
grow on the equator as well not for a
[SPEAKER_00]: research station that's very important to
me and i love the tropical turps far more
[SPEAKER_00]: than the afghan-based ones and i would
love to drive a combine pulling down sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk for square kilometer a day you know
that's fine let's do that so i really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to to scale up to plant equatorial
fields by doing a lot of selections down
[SPEAKER_00]: there and in the constitution of columbia
people are allowed to have 20 plants um as
[SPEAKER_00]: a personal supply and that's you never
ever hear about anybody getting hassled
[SPEAKER_00]: for their 20 plants um sometimes people
would pool them together the regs weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: really clear on whether or not it was per
household or per person and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: deliberately vague as many regulations are
so that they can be interpreted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities as they would wish so the um
but so we ended up putting a few names on
[SPEAKER_00]: a property not where we're getting the
license and just doing the test plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: know trying out a bunch of stuff while
we're waiting for all the licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: process to go through and even from the
beginning we were we went down there when
[SPEAKER_00]: when we saw this initially as a 12 page
regulation i'm jumping all over but the 12
[SPEAKER_00]: page first draft that intrigued me so much
and i said i want to shake the hand of
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever wrote this i got down there um
august 2015 or 16 2016 i guess i'll blurs
[SPEAKER_00]: together here but two two and a bit years
ago august the um the through friends we
[SPEAKER_00]: got invited to go and present in the
congress of columbia meeting with a lawyer
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a very intelligent woman that
wrote that first draft and she was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyer for senator Juan Manuel Galan and
later we met with him separately and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: you know both really sensible people that
want you know sensible drug policy really
[SPEAKER_00]: and there once their first draft came out
um it expanded beyond that and it gave out
[SPEAKER_00]: the official 12 pages but when they tried
to implement and gave out the first couple
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses it was um around january that
year and the opposition and government had
[SPEAKER_00]: never got a chance to look at it or debate
it so they put the brakes on it so it
[SPEAKER_00]: really did hurt the very first people to
apply because it put them in a holding
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern for quite a long time um but as
after the opposition had a went through it
[SPEAKER_00]: tightened it up as they saw it and made it
a little more controlled and awkward for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of us then it was still allowed
to be implemented the current government
[SPEAKER_00]: is less favorable towards cannabis than
the last one and things aren't moving
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as quickly down there as they had
been so that was why i picked it and we
[SPEAKER_00]: really made to that we're the only company
there to have registered genetics actually
[SPEAKER_00]: where we made history to be the register
the first genetics in the history of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country so that's kind of cool i'm very
proud of that and i'm happy that we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: the first ones to go into production with
them shortly um but i'm not as excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about production like partners and other
people are they're really they see the
[SPEAKER_00]: production part more than i see you know
the value in doing the genetics work and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just because it's not just one
monetary value to me it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: selfish pleasure but you know what it
still works out good for the production
[SPEAKER_00]: team too when when i increase the
efficiency of whatever we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve so if we want high thcv strains
well let's bump them up from two percent
[SPEAKER_00]: to twenty percent or you know if you can
do that you just made ten times of
[SPEAKER_00]: production without getting another hectare
you know so so there's so much important
[SPEAKER_00]: in working with genetic and nowadays with
greater legality and more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions there's so many really
qualified people with skills far beyond me
[SPEAKER_00]: in molecular genetics and whatnot that are
able to go to town and work on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things and some of the things they
work on may not be things that we like and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them may be but uh there's no
substitute for nosing your way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: place you know if you're if that's what
you're looking for if i and i follow my
[SPEAKER_00]: nose i really want the most aromatic
varieties for whatever the end goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a higher cannabinoid content
i'm not gonna i just don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that have the smells i don't like and
i find probably half of the aromas and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis i don't like in whatever
combination you know like then some it's
[SPEAKER_00]: uh some totally puts me off and some
totally turns me on and there's there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some middle ground but uh there's a lot of
variety in cannabis aromas there's far
[SPEAKER_00]: more than in wine i forget the actual
number of compounds in each but it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial difference like a factor of 10
um yeah wow so i mean i've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: photos on your instagram feed over the
past say a year or so and you like to use
[SPEAKER_02]: this tag the million seed fino hunt is
that the goal billion seed search yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: well what i've actually working on doing
right now is planting a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds a month so i could do more than that
given the space and hands and materials
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's no problem and once uh but a
thousand seeds a hundred thousand seeds a
[SPEAKER_00]: month that's a good working pool you know
most breeders of any sort be pretty happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that and it's in a year that's a
significant you know you've cracked a
[SPEAKER_00]: million in a year well over and so i put
this million seed search hashtag i said
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that wants to contribute to this
and send me some of their seeds to try i
[SPEAKER_00]: needed a minimum of 75 but now the rigs
have changed and i need a minimum of 100
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant um them out for characterization
and what i'm offering in return is
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that contributes seeds to this
million seed search i will give them back
[SPEAKER_00]: a detailed grow report from that latitude
and altitude and i'm taking it to other
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes and altitudes within columbia
alone have 11 test zones so i have my main
[SPEAKER_00]: farm in one and then one hectare test zone
with the national university in the other
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 zones so that's just in columbia so if
the seeds are vacant to columbia they will
[SPEAKER_00]: be fully tested and you'll get a full
report from all these different scenarios
[SPEAKER_00]: and i will also welcome you to come down
and check everything out for yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: come for your visit and other than that i
tell people if you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute seeds just send me your
wholesale list and we'll buy a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: you so i really want to try and look at
everything out there and if i can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything out there that's okay i'm not
gonna be sweating it too bad because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know i'm looking at tons yeah i'm not
missing much if anything i'm not missing
[SPEAKER_02]: much yeah i mean it's it's a huge
undertaking to say the least i mean i i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know anyone who's even attempted
such a thing on that scale yeah that's it
[SPEAKER_00]: you have somebody has to to go for it you
know you have to to dream it before you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it you know when i start talking
about doing stuff like this people that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know me well i mean you're a dreamer
man you'd never be able to pull that off
[SPEAKER_00]: two years later even when i got to
switzerland i remember uh you know i got
[SPEAKER_00]: there whenever it was it was june i think
it was a little wait to get set up for
[SPEAKER_00]: that summer but i was making grandiose
plans for the following year and i
[SPEAKER_00]: remember uh getting a visit from this guy
gypsy nirvana from the uk and he came over
[SPEAKER_00]: and uh he wrote a little thing after his
first visit going all this guy thinks he's
[SPEAKER_00]: big shit he doesn't have anything planted
yet and he thinks he's gonna have all this
[SPEAKER_00]: going by next year and he's like we'll see
we'll see then he came back the next june
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like holy fuck i got it everything he
said he was going to and it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter of you gotta dream it before you
can do it you know and you have to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself this is what i'm gonna do i'm i
told myself i'm gonna get set up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: legal scenario to plant fields of grass on
the equator as soon as i can i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really care about breeding northern grass
anymore not i mean i'm interested in it
[SPEAKER_00]: not as interested as the tropical stuff
because the perfumes have more high notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and not the not the stank that the kids
are into these days but it's they're only
[SPEAKER_00]: into it because they've never had the
opportunity to try some spectacular
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorial grass maybe unless they live in
hawaii or something right or australia i
[SPEAKER_02]: got that one don't worry you know okay no
i mean i picked up on that little
[SPEAKER_00]: reference don't worry yeah um i loved uh i
gotta say i loved your grass it was the
[SPEAKER_02]: nicest i tried on your land for sure uh
thank you i'm i'm sure there's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: better but i'm glad i could hook you up
with something oh it was really nice so
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the other stuff i tried from the
guys brought me with one or two exceptions
[SPEAKER_00]: but a few other people brought me stuff
but it was usually too chemi to smoke i
[SPEAKER_00]: really remember rolling one case i rolled
a big fat paper because he gave me like a
[SPEAKER_00]: half ounce and i was leaving like the next
day for that town and i was like oh no
[SPEAKER_00]: don't give me all this and i really made
him take it back he didn't want to take it
[SPEAKER_00]: back but i said a little bit keep keep a
little bit but take it because i just felt
[SPEAKER_00]: bad for him so i'm like surely he can find
somebody that actually wants this because
[SPEAKER_00]: i remember i rolled up a big fat joint and
i lit it and i took about three big puffs
[SPEAKER_00]: on it and i looked him in the eye and i
flicked it out the window he's like what'd
[SPEAKER_00]: you do that for i said i can't smoke that
grass and so chemi is burning my lips are
[SPEAKER_00]: still burning from the first few puffs and
i was like i just can't smoke weed like
[SPEAKER_00]: that and he was just holy shit you're
serious and then i pulled out something
[SPEAKER_00]: else and he was like oh yeah something
else and i said yeah so he's he was
[SPEAKER_00]: impressed that i had i had more from
another friend that i'd met the day before
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same town and i gave and i gave it
to the guy with the chemi read and i said
[SPEAKER_00]: why don't you take this home and smoke it
because i can't finish it before i leave
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow so anyway hopefully this was the
best you stood out you stood out
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely oh thank you i appreciate that
i do want to loop back to the start
[SPEAKER_02]: because all this talk of holland and all
that we should probably go back to like
[SPEAKER_02]: canada and you know how did you really get
into things there and then how did that
[SPEAKER_00]: transition into then moving to switzerland
okay um i started growing my own gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: style two plants here three plants there
um back in southwestern ontario near
[SPEAKER_00]: london in middlesex county and the grass i
would pull back there still to this day is
[SPEAKER_00]: up there with anything i've had from
anywhere in the world so i was quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: sold on i am not buying any more grass i
am growing my own because what i'm growing
[SPEAKER_00]: is better than what i could buy and it was
really just a straight home grown play
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning five years of that and
uh been going through university and
[SPEAKER_00]: decided at the end of university i'm going
to move once i'm done i'm going to move to
[SPEAKER_00]: dc because it's the only province in
canada nobody was in jail for growing so
[SPEAKER_00]: it was attractive that way i never wanted
to go to jail for growing and um i moved
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and really took my hobby
breeding to the next level and ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: taking it pro so as i was in vancouver i
had opened um a crow shop where we had
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and fans but only my organic soil
mix or organic fertilizer and we had both
[SPEAKER_00]: um a system for people to grow organic
cocoa mix with steve's special blend and
[SPEAKER_00]: worm castings and whatnot and then we had
a water system that was pure aquaponics so
[SPEAKER_00]: i'd uh i started growing aquaponics when i
very first moved to vancouver actually it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the first closet i even built i built
a quick aquaponics system because i'd
[SPEAKER_00]: always wanted to try that out and i think
that was the first cannabis grown
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponic weed is the best of my knowledge
but the um i kept doing it and then and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was astounding the results when i moved
into the next house i was in i was i made
[SPEAKER_00]: a literally a mickey mouse system that had
a mickey mouse shower curtain where the
[SPEAKER_00]: water trickled under the road
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so stunning that people just lost
it they would just lose their shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would say what the hell did you do to
grow this it's so different than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else we smoke when i tell them they were
just like seriously and the buds were rock
[SPEAKER_00]: hard it wasn't like you were sacrificing
weight you would get the same the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: would turn out the shape it's supposed to
if it's healthy the whole time and the
[SPEAKER_00]: light's dense enough and it packs in its
nodes and the aquaponics just made it burn
[SPEAKER_00]: to a white ash clean white not even gray
it was stupid how clean it burned and so i
[SPEAKER_00]: was a huge fan of that and i thought for
indoors or greenhouse i would if i ever
[SPEAKER_00]: set up another indoor greenhouse i will
only be doing it aquaponically but it that
[SPEAKER_00]: way and the uh but other than that i
really get a kick out of growing straight
[SPEAKER_00]: into a field and i'm mending the soil sure
i'm not above that in some dolomite lime
[SPEAKER_00]: bone meal or back one or molasses any any
assortment of good organic goodies the but
[SPEAKER_00]: that that was it so i was doing this
aquaponics and that was getting attention
[SPEAKER_00]: of any any of the pot writers they would
come to the city for a visit and high
[SPEAKER_00]: times would want to come to my house and
tour my gardens or whatever so various
[SPEAKER_00]: various ones from andre grossman or ed
rosenthal or or this or that this they
[SPEAKER_00]: would all come through there was anny but
very to think of all but there was there
[SPEAKER_00]: was at least four from high times that
used to come through vancouver once a year
[SPEAKER_00]: writing an article so they'd come and look
at whatever gardens we were doing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest strains and the technology that
we're using and whatnot and the aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: system was always quite popular they it
was dubbed guppy ponics i believe in one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the magazines maybe red eye magazine
with nick from the uk um so as i was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that place ed rosenthal was about to go on
a consulting gig to switzerland for these
[SPEAKER_00]: three brothers that had one of the maybe
the biggest commercial grow operation in
[SPEAKER_00]: switzerland and he invited me along um and
said how would you like to co-consult on
[SPEAKER_00]: this gig i have in switzerland right now
and i said sounds like a blast let's check
[SPEAKER_00]: this out so we went over there and i
realized how legal legal can be like you
[SPEAKER_00]: could go to the supermarket and buy trays
of cuttings right beside the dusty
[SPEAKER_00]: miller's geraniums peppers and tomatoes
they had trays of white widow trays of
[SPEAKER_00]: compote hemp they had they must have had
40 or 50 varieties of cannabis just at the
[SPEAKER_00]: front door of the grocery store for $7.99
a clone or something like that and they
[SPEAKER_00]: had the same little plant tags with a
picture of the bud or a picture of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and on the back it would say plant
in full sun well-drained soil heavy feeder
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it finishes in 120 days like it
was just normal it was boring it was so
[SPEAKER_00]: normal and and these three brothers one of
their four farms was a cloning operation
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were cranking out a shitload of
clones like a hundred thousand a week or
[SPEAKER_00]: something what i yeah and i had another
partner because they were supplying not
[SPEAKER_00]: only to the grocery stores but to all
these commercial warehouse growers or
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse growers that were buying them
20 000 at a time you know so it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial they had a couple of delivery
trucks with shelves in them and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: robotic transplanters like it was amazing
it was it used to be a poinsettia
[SPEAKER_00]: operation and when the when the poinsettia
business in switzerland lost its trade
[SPEAKER_00]: protection there was a free trade
agreement through the eu that included
[SPEAKER_00]: moroccan poinsettias and even though
switzerland wasn't part of the eu they had
[SPEAKER_00]: part they had some trade agreements with
them and it literally knocked out the
[SPEAKER_00]: subsidies for this poinsettia farm and the
guy this old man nothing to do with graph
[SPEAKER_00]: just didn't want to lose his multi-million
dollar greenhouse investment you know so
[SPEAKER_00]: he rented it to these three brothers and
they cranked out this clone operation
[SPEAKER_00]: there it was a marvel to behold back then
and that was 1999 and today it would still
[SPEAKER_00]: be cutting edge so it was pretty cool to
go over and consult in that operation for
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks and in the weekend in the middle
they'd suggested to us you should check
[SPEAKER_00]: out other parts of the country whatnot so
we went and explored a bit actually no i
[SPEAKER_00]: think it was a on the next next time i
came back that i went down i thought i was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be up in that area because after
the two weeks there i was like i'm coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back i'm gonna have a farm this is that
i'm shutting down my whole life in dc and
[SPEAKER_00]: moving here to get a farm to grow it wide
open they go like tomatoes i'll happily
[SPEAKER_00]: pay my taxes and be a good citizen just
let me do this and i was going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back and go so i called my wife and told
her to start preparing and then i came
[SPEAKER_00]: home here for two weeks to bc and went
back over and after the first few days or
[SPEAKER_00]: first week up in the german side where
it's a little you know can be drizzly and
[SPEAKER_00]: gray and you know it's all german food and
german speaking which i don't speak german
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was okay i was there sitting with
my german book the first week or two
[SPEAKER_00]: saying i should study you know really
trying to learn some german and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: one weekend my friend said have you ever
been down to ticino i was like no it's our
[SPEAKER_00]: ticino they call it and i said no it's
it's the nicest part of switzerland we
[SPEAKER_00]: always go there for our holidays south of
the yelps it's all italian and it used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of italy and the food's all
italian and it's really nice you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: love it the weather's better i went down
there that weekend check it out and i
[SPEAKER_00]: called them and say i'm not coming back
i've got all my stuff with me we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have an office and an operation down here
i'm literally the sunshine alone is
[SPEAKER_00]: justification of me not doing this an hour
outside of zura this is the smart place to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it it's a different climate it's a
better climate and they got no argument
[SPEAKER_00]: from them because they said oh that'll
give us an excuse to come down there more
[SPEAKER_00]: often they love to go for their holiday
weekends so i sat up down there and uh had
[SPEAKER_00]: a good run of it for a while and then
things turned sideways there when sadly um
[SPEAKER_00]: the the pope came down on it in a nutshell
and what happened was most of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: were growing there was no law it wasn't
that switzerland legalized cannabis it was
[SPEAKER_00]: that it never made it illegal for growing
it had made it illegal to use it as a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: and to sell it there were no hash bars
like amsterdam but there were fields of it
[SPEAKER_00]: along the side of the train full of white
widow or white shark you name it it was
[SPEAKER_00]: grown wide open and it was sold wide open
in pot stores they would have humo stacked
[SPEAKER_00]: to the roof in the front walls of the
stores you know it was ridiculous and
[SPEAKER_00]: under the sidewalk of chiasso which is a
town there's como and chiasso como's in
[SPEAKER_00]: italy and chiasso's in switzerland and
there's a border on the main street
[SPEAKER_00]: basically so the if you walked from the
italian side into the swiss side there
[SPEAKER_00]: were pot leaf sandwich boards all the way
down the sidewalks for the first three
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks probably and people would walk over
and buy cannabis and walk back to italy
[SPEAKER_00]: and the uh they italians actually had to
change their laws because they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: border guys were forced to charge anybody
they found with it so they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced that to they could let anybody go
with five grams or less without charging
[SPEAKER_00]: them so that was their big win at the time
but then the people would just walk over
[SPEAKER_00]: every day and buy five grams and they
would walk back and the border guys would
[SPEAKER_00]: just roll their eyes and wave them through
because it wasn't what are they going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do take five grams from 50 000 people
every day just not happening right so but
[SPEAKER_00]: then what happened was an investigative
reporter from rome he came up and went
[SPEAKER_00]: into one of the bigger shops i won't say
whose shop or whatnot but the but the they
[SPEAKER_00]: had him he had a hidden camera and
microphone and he went in saw all the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: asked to see some samples how much a kilo
is 1500 a kilo for this frosty greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: grown but you know dutch varieties and
he's he said oh it's such a shame that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get this in rome he says i could
make a fortune if i get this in rome at
[SPEAKER_00]: this price and the and the shop owner said
hey at this price we offer 24 hour free
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery to rome so that played on the tv
and then the you know the flood of kids
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking dope on st peter's square whatever
pope was pissed off about the weed and he
[SPEAKER_00]: called the prosecutor in the region told
her if you're a good catholic you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: round these people up and do a big
inspection and even if you can't legally
[SPEAKER_00]: shut them down make their lives hard and
the pope came down on it that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: what the higher-ups told us my lawyer was
friends with uh with the lady or knew her
[SPEAKER_00]: from school they were in the same law
school and and i had she didn't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: about our company but she came down on it
because my lawyer called her because we
[SPEAKER_00]: had a problem with a thief that kept
breaking in and this thief was renowned in
[SPEAKER_00]: this neighborhood and i'd caught him and
beat him up a couple times i was like if i
[SPEAKER_00]: catch him again what am i going to do like
i just i say i want to stop myself to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect them so i said get this thief
arrested we're taxpaying company we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing everything above board there was
literally no reason not to use them to put
[SPEAKER_00]: them away except we didn't know they were
just lining up the ducks to do a big
[SPEAKER_00]: roundup of the industry and when he
brought us to her attention she's like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm glad you told me about them because
we're just about to round up 99 pot
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and we never heard of this one
and we didn't have a sign all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones were growing and have retail stores
where they were selling the product not
[SPEAKER_00]: joints or hash mind you but just bags of
grass and so she wanted to do a roundup
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection of us we're not doing anything
illegal we have all our stuff in order
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're a seed company and seeds are
you know unmistakably legal and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: being exported to only legal countries the
federals government gave us rebates on our
[SPEAKER_00]: annual employee taxes paid and everything
if you were considered an export company
[SPEAKER_00]: and 70 percent of your production was
exported ours was 97 percent of our
[SPEAKER_00]: production was exported then the swiss
government gave you a huge rebate on all
[SPEAKER_00]: the taxes you paid over there so we were
really totally above board and not hiding
[SPEAKER_00]: anything so we were quite uh quite
perturbed when they wanted to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection and whatnot but we let them go
ahead and they get to see a mountain of
[SPEAKER_00]: what did you do with all the flowers after
you take the seeds out of them we compost
[SPEAKER_00]: them where do you compost them in the
compost pile you take there's literally a
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain of bud composting with seeds
sprouting out of it like a chia pet like
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just okay so that's what all that
bud looks like yeah so we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: show them everything so we didn't have any
legal troubles but i just thought if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna start being a hassle i don't
need this shit you know so and then i was
[SPEAKER_00]: just happy to wrap it up at that point and
we had a lot of seeds produced and stashed
[SPEAKER_00]: too so we could just ride off that for a
while so we shut down the company i
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sold the facility to shanty baba
when i left and i was in spain and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly they when i had a disagreement a
family disagreement so i said i'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna leave if they're gonna be dicks
about and he said oh they're just trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to scare away you cowboys it was his words
exactly but then a few months later they
[SPEAKER_00]: picked them up and stuck them in a dungeon
condemned by amnesty international it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 400 year old mandrisio dungeon so i
felt super bad for the guy because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: the nicest guy i remember writing him a
letter back back in the day but i hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that was well with him i haven't talked to
him in a dog's age but yeah so that was
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of how how i got uh through it in
canada in switzerland out of switzerland
[SPEAKER_00]: and then starting up again now in the
tropics yeah wow what an adventure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been wild and now and this year is really
going to be something because um mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: has just come around st vincent jamaica
we've been getting invites to other parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world throughout africa even asia
including china and thailand but i think i
[SPEAKER_00]: am going to focus my efforts this year
predominantly between columbia mexico and
[SPEAKER_00]: canada and may do um i've been offered 20
acres in jamaica and 20 acres in st
[SPEAKER_00]: vincent so i'm tempted to take those up
because island time is always a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: but uh mexico is such a hotbed of amazing
cannabis evolution different valleys in
[SPEAKER_00]: mexico i've always been intrigued by you
know great oaxaca and the first time i was
[SPEAKER_00]: ever in mexico was when i was 16 which was
a long time ago and the first mexican bud
[SPEAKER_00]: i ever saw that wasn't brickweed in north
america the first mexican bud i saw in
[SPEAKER_00]: mexico was gorgeous frosty purple bud from
a little mayan guy and i was totally blown
[SPEAKER_00]: away i was 16 it was like i was just
starting to see frosty bud you know i was
[SPEAKER_00]: like 14 15 16 you were seeing a lot more
brickweed from mexico or jamaica is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we had the commonly in canada at that time
and a lot more hash and oil because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an import seen in those pack a
little better um the local production
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't really catching on yet the people
were growing mexican or jamaican seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't always working out too well so
by the time people started growing modern
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids like skunk or northern lights and
modern at the time so it was a real
[SPEAKER_00]: eye-opener you'd be like whoa this is what
it's supposed to be like now i get it you
[SPEAKER_00]: know so they were like and we and this is
from here we don't have to import this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit you know this is great so we just had
time to go to town and learn how to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: and me and my friends all got into putting
a few plants out and helping each other
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe one of them would have a place where
we could keep a light and a few mothers
[SPEAKER_00]: and start some cuts and then we would take
them out so it was uh you know we all drew
[SPEAKER_00]: our own but it was still a team effort but
it was fun and and you know that that was
[SPEAKER_00]: a good time i totally always will have
fond memories of that the people that got
[SPEAKER_00]: pinched doing it at the time will not have
such fond memories of it because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: got caught with one plant back then you
were getting no time and it still just
[SPEAKER_00]: turns my stomach to see the people that
think we should be in a fucking cage
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have better taste in herbs than
them you know yeah definitely you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what i mean i mean i saw the repression of
this not just it was not obviously just in
[SPEAKER_00]: canada you see the whole world how many
millions of people are banged up for this
[SPEAKER_00]: bloody tasty herb it just made me insane
and i always thought too that the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: we could fight back was teaching our
friends to grow their own and teach and
[SPEAKER_00]: telling them teach your friends to grow
their own and really get a strong culture
[SPEAKER_00]: that going so no matter how they you know
shut down the borders or whatever they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to build a wall we've got the goods
fuck it it doesn't matter we don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: the we don't need mexican brickweed coming
up here by the bale we've got kind bud
[SPEAKER_00]: here ourselves and that's satisfying but i
think to this day in the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: countries of the world the entire system
the shit system is trying to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant extinct and at that point there
wasn't a country in the world that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make the plant extinct and when
you think what right does one species have
[SPEAKER_00]: to make another species extinct that's the
ultimate in hubris you know and i just
[SPEAKER_00]: thought this is just unacceptable and i'm
thinking not on my watch i'm going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything i can to preserve these plants
and spread them around and i'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be alone doing it but it really was the
people that were committed to doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: early on that there was a really good
feeling between people that felt the same
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were happy to share you know and
it wasn't a matter of hoarding and i can
[SPEAKER_00]: see as it becomes legal people are going
to want to maintain an advantage of having
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary genetics and stuff and i'll be
the same too but at the time it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: more a matter of preservation and that we
didn't want to see this get lost and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were think of how much governments spent
flying around spraying stuff and pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: out plants with helicopters that we saw
you know if they can afford to fly around
[SPEAKER_00]: the country pulling plants out of
cornfields and backyards and cliffs and
[SPEAKER_00]: you name it you're thinking what do they
need our money for they've got way too
[SPEAKER_00]: much time and money on their hands if they
can fly around the fucking world ripping
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs out of our yards you know or the
bush like how much does that cost that's
[SPEAKER_00]: insane and when i it really put me against
government and that's never changed you
[SPEAKER_00]: know i've just lost you know any shred of
respect for governments when they
[SPEAKER_00]: persecute cannabis users and i just you
know but that's probably going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: lifelong even when they grudgingly
legalize it but on shitty terms i'm still
[SPEAKER_00]: not impressed you know so i think well
it's still better than some places where
[SPEAKER_00]: you mean at least canadians smoking a
joint in most municipalities aren't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a trouble but like in canada it's
you know changes in every municipality
[SPEAKER_00]: right now so there's the feds let the
provinces do what they want and the
[SPEAKER_00]: provinces tell the municipalities you can
kind of do as you see fit as well so in
[SPEAKER_00]: one side of town here i am you can't smoke
in public and the other side you can smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere you can have a cigarette so it's
not a consistent open legalization it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a simple legal like tomatoes
legalization like i'd seen in switzerland
[SPEAKER_00]: when i moved there and that was the most
beautiful to see that you could grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: field of weed as many as you wanted
without any regulation concerning
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing or anything like that it was the
end use was the issue and as seeds was my
[SPEAKER_00]: end use and i was growing research crops
that was fine i didn't have a bong bar i
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't selling blocks of hash to you know
their kids at school i was simply growing
[SPEAKER_00]: a field of weed picking out my favorites
sampling it as i would and i mean i'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: real hash smoker it takes a lot of weed to
keep a real hash smoker and melt you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not something you can do with four
plants which the canadian regs currently
[SPEAKER_00]: are permitting and in bc you can only grow
four plants if your neighbors can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: them if your neighbors can see them you
get six months mandatory minimum or
[SPEAKER_00]: something stupid like it's it's so far
from a rational legalization i mean i know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worse than australia and i think you
know i hate to be bitching when we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some ground covered but it really is one
of those cases where it's far from good
[SPEAKER_02]: but i'm sure it's good from afar you know
yeah i mean are you having bain here and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a little bit of exposure you know
what do you think is the way for australia
[SPEAKER_02]: to move forward given we've got nothing so
far really well all you need is nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't need to do anything other than
return it to its original state as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: our fucking planet you know the
regulations are what destroy it the it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't a problem before they regulated it
you know the regulations are where it went
[SPEAKER_00]: downhill so i'm a real free marketeer i
would be happy if i could pull up at the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the road and buy untested buds
from the hippies that live there but if if
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else wants to walk into a
pharmacy and get something that's verified
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and third party tested to be free
of contaminants i have no problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: that some company maybe my own will exist
to fill that need but i don't think it has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be because let's face it how many of us
have ever ever had verified clean bud it's
[SPEAKER_00]: clean because it's generally clean and and
if it's contaminated you can smell it you
[SPEAKER_00]: open a bag of weed with mold in it you
don't need a test to tell you it's moldy
[SPEAKER_00]: you can smell that moldy weed as soon as
you open the bag you know there's and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's degrees of tolerance so in canada
cfus colony forming units the limit with
[SPEAKER_00]: health canada's 50 000 cfus per gram now i
don't know and i've been asking them
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatedly for a solid year or two what is
the tolerance for cfu per gram on cigars
[SPEAKER_00]: because if there is a fucking discrepancy
between what a cohiba can have and what a
[SPEAKER_00]: reefer can have we've got a problem and
the the canadian regs clearly favor
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco health canada's absolutely shat
the bed on this one because they've made
[SPEAKER_00]: it impossible for a gram of weed to equal
a gram of tobacco price-wise because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've made a flat tax of a minimum a
dollar on every gram so they don't tax
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco that way if they did tobacco in
canada would be as expensive as it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: australia because holy fuck i was
surprised to see how expensive cigarettes
[SPEAKER_02]: were in australia yeah right that's the
real nanny state at play there yeah but
[SPEAKER_00]: canada but canada's protecting the tobacco
lobby by ensuring even it's not even a
[SPEAKER_00]: question of low thc or anything even if i
had low thc hemp flowers they would still
[SPEAKER_00]: tax it a dollar a gram which makes it
virtually impossible in british columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: at least it varies in canada pack of
cigarettes and in bc is 20 in ontario it's
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 so it kind of varies by province how
many cigarettes are in a pack i think in
[SPEAKER_00]: australia they were 30 in a pack but in bc
a pack of cigarettes is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood of 12 to 17 dollars so it's
creeping up on you know it's somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 50 cents and a dollar of smoke but
not quite a dollar of smoke but that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: kitten caboodle if it was 20 hemp
cigarettes it would be 20 x size right off
[SPEAKER_00]: the top then the price of the product plus
sales tax so they're absolutely ensuring
[SPEAKER_00]: if i want to sell joints for the same
price as cigarettes they've made it
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematically impossible and there is no
reason to tax cannabis you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of cancer for more than the
cause of it you know it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: asinine so they just uh the canadian
government just pisses me off endlessly as
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm sure yours does to you yeah i mean the
thing they say to us which i'm not sure i
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine the canadian government would do
the same is that they say that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to tax more on tobacco maybe they
don't do it in canada but in australia
[SPEAKER_02]: they say we're going to back attacks
tobacco harder because that's how we can
[SPEAKER_02]: still be able to offer um you know
universal health care because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: covering all the the burden on the health
care system of the smokers it's all a tax
[SPEAKER_00]: grab my my australian doctor father-in-law
explained to me who is actually a lung
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor and dealt with nothing but people
dying of smoking diseases his whole life
[SPEAKER_00]: and he straight up told me he said smokers
cost the system less because they die
[SPEAKER_00]: younger it's the people that are on life
support who dragon it out from 80 to 90
[SPEAKER_00]: that have you know a bunch of little
ailments that are in to see the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: three times a week those cost the system a
shitload not the guys that die of strokes
[SPEAKER_02]: at 50 you know yeah i mean it's i'd love
to see the figures behind it but yeah i
[SPEAKER_00]: mean the tax in australia younger you just
check it out do the math on smokers die
[SPEAKER_00]: younger and the elder seniors cost the
system the most yeah yeah definitely so
[SPEAKER_00]: senior is getting old that should be
illegal yeah okay i mean i'd love to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that one illegal tax people for getting
old the older you get the more you owe
[SPEAKER_00]: should be encouraged to die young for the
good of society leave a pretty body
[SPEAKER_02]: something i wanted to ask about is you
referenced it earlier and you can feel
[SPEAKER_02]: free to be a little bit ambiguous or as
specific as you like but i've noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a few companies there are
definitely a few companies that offer like
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what looks like your work and
sometimes it's a bit ambiguous just to see
[SPEAKER_02]: like is this them doing a knockoff or
whatnot and so i've got one specific i'd
[SPEAKER_02]: love to ask about is do you have any
relationship with alpine seeds because i
[SPEAKER_02]: can see they offer a whole bunch of there
you go because they offer a bunch of sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: grapefruit stuff like fems bxs stuff like
that and it looked like it was more on the
[SPEAKER_02]: legit end just due to how deep of an
offering they had for sweet pink
[SPEAKER_02]: grapefruit but i guess at this point
you're just used to it you know being the
[SPEAKER_00]: game like that yeah this is an interesting
point you know is i've been you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: some eyes a hothead about this over the
years but i really have a fairly to me
[SPEAKER_00]: simple understanding of the way this can
work good for everybody when i share or
[SPEAKER_00]: sell genetics like let's say sweet tooth
for example if i make a cross and i call
[SPEAKER_00]: it sweet tooth and nobody else has called
their cross sweet tooth you know that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: original seed cross and its original name
for it if you take those and make more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds with them i only ask that you give
them a new name because the seeds you have
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be the same as mine you know so i
say i don't mind if you want to call it
[SPEAKER_00]: dente dulce and put in bracket i made this
f2 with sweet tooth or whatever you know
[SPEAKER_00]: but call it something else because it it
confuses people down the line and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what really happened a lot with sweets
going to actually but the uh but sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: tooth is a good example it's uh they're
all good examples i mean it's happened
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of them as soon as your seeds
popular people are making knockoffs of it
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a given the uh there's you know
it's the only seed breeding in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: that couldn't be protected with breeder's
rights so so it was a easy thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: unscrupulous hacks to just start chucking
pollen in their closet and calling it a
[SPEAKER_00]: popular name but the letdown for me was
that that the vendors would carry them i
[SPEAKER_00]: would feel like you know what i want to
stop supplying these people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: selling knockoffs of the seeds i worked on
because i promote them i get them the
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure into the cup or whatever then the
next week everybody's selling it as their
[SPEAKER_00]: own and you're just like for fuck sakes
people have some have a little respect and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little dignity and i can give your
seeds an original name because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds i'm happy if you credit them
say where they came from i don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: care but if you want to i'm happy to do
that shows respect and that's cool and i
[SPEAKER_00]: did the same thing when i was making seeds
as i would always list to the best of my
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge the origins the real origins
because we were preservationists as well
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a duty to carry things on
accurately to the best of our ability
[SPEAKER_00]: considering even record keeping was a
liability when i started growing i didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even like keeping pictures i had a couple
polaroids which i hopefully i still have
[SPEAKER_00]: but from from ways back when but you
didn't keep a roll of pictures of your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow rooms because when people were in
court the cops would say well here we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got photos of all this crash you've grown
and that would use it against them so you
[SPEAKER_00]: you were covering your tracks to keep no
record so it was really a verbal oral
[SPEAKER_00]: tradition um so you know accuracy and as a
breeder you know accurate labeling is
[SPEAKER_00]: everything if you not do an accurate
labeling it's crazy so it just makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think i know we can't call your
sweet you've already called these ones you
[SPEAKER_00]: know so it's uh not just marketing but
it's really it makes me crazy when i see
[SPEAKER_00]: people growing hermy sweet skunk it wasn't
my sweet skunk but it was somebody's some
[SPEAKER_00]: idiot fucking would sell some sweet skunk
and then everybody would be going i like
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet skunk but it's hermy it's like no it
wasn't fucking till that moron started
[SPEAKER_00]: selling self ones you know so it really
dilutes your work when people sell their
[SPEAKER_00]: work as yours you know or mistakenly close
like easily mistakenly close but like when
[SPEAKER_00]: people were making i gave bode hill one
line for blockhead years ago and say you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and somebody made up the they
understood my point and i said if you
[SPEAKER_00]: called it square dome and put blockhead
back cross you'd have no problem i'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking sending you christmas cards that's
super cool but if people can mistake yours
[SPEAKER_00]: for mine then it becomes an issue down the
road when people start getting stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not representative of what i put
out and they start blaming me for it what
[SPEAKER_00]: are you gonna think right so that's you
know neither here nor there you know an
[SPEAKER_00]: egregious example was it still is uh
barney's barney's farm in afsterdam there
[SPEAKER_00]: was no barney's farm when they entered
sweet tooth in the cup the sweet tooth
[SPEAKER_00]: they entered in the cup was grown by a
dutch grower who bought the seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: vancouver and was actually growing sweet
tooth i was at the same cup unloading a
[SPEAKER_00]: pile of sweet tooth as free samples my
seed sweet tooth was all the rage and the
[SPEAKER_00]: uh and so the coffee shop at barney's won
the cup of sweet tooth i was very happy
[SPEAKER_00]: for them i knew it was our sweet tooth
then a few months later they come out with
[SPEAKER_00]: barney's farm and a seed line called sweet
tooth that they made up you know whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage they used was totally unrelated
they didn't actually make it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tooth from me they took their own
cross and just called the sweet tooth and
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked nothing like it it didn't look
like the bud they entered in the cup i
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it was just painful to see this
blatant name rip off you know and i just
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that's just shameless and uh later
they came out with shish ka berry i see
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a new release i saw online
somebody sent me a link they said here
[SPEAKER_00]: check this out barney just released a new
strain called shish ka berry that's funny
[SPEAKER_00]: because i seem to remember making that mid
90s the same crop i made the sweet tooth
[SPEAKER_00]: with with the same dad and all but it's a
new strain at barney's now and there's it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like it should be descended from
shish ka berry but their sweet tooth
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't even look like it's descended from
sweet tooth it's just a blatant step on
[SPEAKER_00]: the name and the sad thing is is now
there's going to be people growing out
[SPEAKER_00]: barney's sweet tooth and thinking it's
sweet tooth or sharing it with people and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going hey this is a sweet tooth
and they're like this isn't very sweet you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's the big deal with sweet tooth
sweet tooth isn't all that it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: you've never even had the real sweet tooth
you know so it's a bit painful to see
[SPEAKER_00]: these people abusing it and that's one
thing i look forward to in legalization is
[SPEAKER_00]: i haven't released anything new since like
2003 and i've been working on things for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last few years and i'm really excited
to bring them out but i'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention the name of them until i consume
people's asses for fucking knocking them
[SPEAKER_00]: off you know so that's it it's uh and that
gives more viability to the business of
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up r&d centers for seed you know
if if you're out there going to the ends
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world to plant fields and you know
do it where you can legally and whatnot it
[SPEAKER_00]: means leaving your comfort zone sometimes
and it's called work but when uh people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in their bloody apartments making
knockoffs in their closet and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't end up with the same retailer i
just didn't want it i won't deal with the
[SPEAKER_00]: the retailers that have a bad um history
of selling knockoffs i just pissed me off
[SPEAKER_00]: too much and i would really like to come
back out with seeds once i can sell them
[SPEAKER_00]: direct and cut out the middleman and bring
really good quality good value seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to people but it still would be
you know another division and at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point a i'm not ready to release them and
b i'm just going to decide closer to the
[SPEAKER_00]: time because i would like to have direct
retail and know that they're not getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: switch in bait and switch practice like
even at 20 of these other resellers they
[SPEAKER_00]: might keep stuff up that looks like it's
available when it's sold out i mean
[SPEAKER_00]: there's people pretending to be selling
seeds they bought from me 15 years ago for
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years i know they don't still have
those seeds but they're saying they do
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you send them money to order
them they're going to send you a
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement you know and say oh actually
we're out of that not not well we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that for 14 years and it's still on
the menu you know like there's just so
[SPEAKER_00]: many grease balls in the business that i
was like i just can't do it like this i
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta wait until i can do it openly and
legally again because there's just so many
[SPEAKER_00]: greasy people to deal with and the sad
thing is now that it's legal again and
[SPEAKER_00]: they got all these stock pimps and whatnot
it's almost greasier now i think in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of ways it's actually gone downhill i've
seen the caliber of people involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: alleged cannabis trade they may just be
involved in the paper trade but they
[SPEAKER_00]: consider it the cannabis trade because
they're not actually qualified to do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in the cannabis trade so these
bloody paper pushers are really greasing
[SPEAKER_00]: up the scene and it's it's at the point
where you know you don't even want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to a cannabis convention in canada because
of the greasy low-life industry players
[SPEAKER_00]: these days and like of the first 15
companies there was over 13 of them hired
[SPEAKER_00]: a lobby group to press for the arrests of
bud tenders and dispensaries because
[SPEAKER_00]: people were exercising their power of
choice and deciding that the pot from the
[SPEAKER_00]: local unlicensed dispensary was several
magnitudes of quality better than what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were ordering on line from these
licensed corporations and those and not
[SPEAKER_00]: all but most of those corporations lobbied
for their arrests and i'm very pro-choice
[SPEAKER_00]: free market person if people think they're
getting a better product from somebody i
[SPEAKER_00]: go that's buy it from them and if they
think your product sucks they shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: a captive market for your shareholders you
know and if you have to cage your
[SPEAKER_00]: competition to succeed you're a piece of
shit and that's those same companies most
[SPEAKER_00]: of them lobbied against field-grown pot
outdoor they lobbied um against homegrown
[SPEAKER_00]: even because they really wanted you to
have to buy their 17 dollar grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: overdried flavorless but and most
canadians that have sampled weed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal producers they've found i would say
no more than five that anyone likes the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed from the rest of them people just
constantly complain and it's a dance
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're only allowed to belong to
two lps at a time the patients belong to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lps so they have to put their script
with two lps and that was an increase from
[SPEAKER_00]: one so they have they're at the mercy and
most of those lps will really get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: business wanting to serve the rec market
and the med market was just an excuse for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little while and they have left their
patients hanging as they put the weed out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the rec market and the the government
was ultimately failed in its attempt to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a legal industry in a timely manner
they wanted to protect the kids and get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of the black market and make sure that
the supply was safe and tested and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these noble pursuits but what's happened
is you know the organized crime is the
[SPEAKER_00]: government it is a lot of the kleptocracy
we live in with the corporations joined at
[SPEAKER_00]: the hip with regulatory capture with
what's happening there so you know those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys were lobbying against outdoor growing
because they knew it would make their
[SPEAKER_00]: their flowering facilities and the white
elephants and it that's just not the way
[SPEAKER_00]: business is steering government we've got
a problem and it's you know ready to cage
[SPEAKER_00]: us rather than concede losses to a better
competitor which was the black market was
[SPEAKER_00]: kicking their ass all over the place so
you know and the legal market also failed
[SPEAKER_00]: to come out with edibles and extracts at
the same time as grass I understand there
[SPEAKER_00]: was maybe some strategy politically behind
that and that they didn't want to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: getting grass through on the first wave
because those in opposition were
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely adamant against shatter and
edibles right the children the children
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I do believe there was some
strategy probably but they in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: states that legalized it they did it all
at once you know so it was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointing to see that lack of
follow-through here yeah the other point
[SPEAKER_00]: did I swear I had another point on the no
I'm enjoying it all one thing I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: just quickly ask so because it was just
you mentioned it a minute ago if you did
[SPEAKER_02]: you know get that direct to customer or
even if it went through a trusted
[SPEAKER_02]: middleman however you end up doing it
would that mean a return for spice of life
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds or would it be under a different
banner and that's a good question and it
[SPEAKER_00]: might even be a couple of brands you know
it's a possibility there's a good you know
[SPEAKER_00]: of course it would be fun to bring back
spice but sometimes a new project needs a
[SPEAKER_00]: new name too you know so I'm open to doing
both even I'm just not gonna say it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm away a little ways away from
that another thing that I'm actually
[SPEAKER_00]: considering that you just brought up is
spice of like verified genetics so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to offer a three level program
essentially for producers for me to verify
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're growing what they say they
are be that it's an approved quality that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these guys are doing a pretty good
job of this and the third level being
[SPEAKER_00]: spice of life brand or their breeder Steve
or however we want to dress it up and say
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys are doing exceptionally well I
would be happy to call it my own it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking good you know so if I the people I
meet that I believe can do that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: offering them a chance the producers that
I think can do the same quality of grass
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently that I would totally respect
and I say I would supply you with genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: forever I'll just keep sending you new
stuff as I want to release it and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no upfront cost but I would like residual
10 cents a gram on the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder Steve brands let's say and I would
have consistent packaging for them to get
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it was exactly the same from
Anchorage to Auckland you know in anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world if you bought Breeder Steve
brand buds you knew it came in this
[SPEAKER_00]: package with this security feature you
know and really have us and then have an
[SPEAKER_00]: annual party where the licensed spice
growers can get together you can swap
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds we can have lots of fun but we'll
have definitely have an annual party for
[SPEAKER_00]: get together and I'll encourage this sort
of network of spice growers to share
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst themselves because if it's so nice
when you have favorite flavors that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you can reliably find a good version
of it consistently wherever you go that
[SPEAKER_00]: just doesn't happen in cannabis yet you
know so I think that would be you know
[SPEAKER_00]: something to achieve if we could do it so
that's been on my mind more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: recently because there's a new window for
introducing genetics into the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: legal system right now it used to be that
they original originally there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: window where they could bring in no
questions asked genetics for the first X
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of LPs after a certain date they
closed that down and they could only buy
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell what they'd had brought into the
system between each other so they were all
[SPEAKER_00]: selling each other clones for gouging
rates usually like 50 you know here give
[SPEAKER_00]: me 15 grand for the genetic and then $17 a
clone for the 10,000 clones you need and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't give them to anybody else in the big
contrary it was all just okay but then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all growing the same thing like
literally every single LP in Canada grows
[SPEAKER_00]: Shishkeberry but the sad thing is it's a
pretty pathetic selection they've got I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I haven't seen any of the LPs do a
really nice job with it I've seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out like frosty and full and I
think I don't know it's just not there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: another Shishkeberry clone going around
the black market in BC making fruity
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous fat frosty nugs it's it's twice
as nice to cutting as the one in the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: system so that's kind of too bad but at
least there's a room to bring that other
[SPEAKER_00]: one into the legal system because under
the new cannabis act new growers and new
[SPEAKER_00]: licensees are allowed to bring in genetics
from wherever they want one time so they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to declare them all at their opening
of their license you know okay here's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I have and they have to provide evidence
that they have you know if they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: these hundred clones and these hundred
seeds or whatever so there's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: because they realize they need a fresh
influx into this very closed loop system
[SPEAKER_00]: when they they don't understand the
importance of genetic diversity that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: understatement but the point I was trying
to make earlier when I was pitching about
[SPEAKER_00]: how they could have done that licensing a
little better where they failed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rollout I just remembered was they spent
over 20 years licensing growers to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: without ever licensing them to sell so all
they would have had to do was say and
[SPEAKER_00]: every single one of those growers wants to
go legal but they don't want to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: open a public company to do it to meet a
bunch of asinine expenses and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: those growers submit pot for third-party
verification if you must and call that
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed you know hey you pass the batch
cleanliness test you're in you get to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes and they would all jump at the
possibility so well the Canadian media
[SPEAKER_00]: frets about the Canadian great Canadian
pot shortage pot has never been more
[SPEAKER_00]: available or less expensive in this
country than it is right now you would be
[SPEAKER_00]: astounded man you can get pounds of bud
you would like for under a thousand bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: like six hundred bucks four hundred bucks
what you know yeah it's so cheap here now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so cheap and the people that have
absolutely let's call them gormless they
[SPEAKER_00]: still walk into a dispensary and pay
fifteen dollars because they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that even grows pot or haven't
tried to themselves but if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of friends that are growers they're
going price if you have any friends you're
[SPEAKER_00]: literally going to be able to get nice pot
these days for so cheap whereas they go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the dispensary or go online to order
from the Ontario cannabis store or
[SPEAKER_00]: something and they're paying like there's
plenty of cannabis in the 15 to 17 dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: a gram range and I think there was some
that was even higher and I'm not opposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to there being luxury items and charging a
high price for stuff that's fine but it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't they shouldn't you know there's
no ceiling on price but they put a on
[SPEAKER_00]: upwards price but they put a ceiling on
downwards price you know so you can't go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the floor and make something
actually really cheap like if I could sell
[SPEAKER_00]: a pack of pre-rolled joints that were a
gram each same as a pack of cigarettes for
[SPEAKER_00]: five dollars less than a pack of
cigarettes or even a dollar less than a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of cigarettes all in tell me that
would it be appealing to many smokers who
[SPEAKER_00]: are very price conscious they'd say boy oh
boy I can smoke that nice organic grass
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cheaper than I can smoke cigarettes
would that encourage people to smoke more
[SPEAKER_00]: nice organic grass rather than cigarettes
I think it would call me crazy but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: people are pretty sensitive and if they're
given the option to enjoy bud and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no reason we can't grow fat frosty
full ripe buds and have them like cobs of
[SPEAKER_00]: corn and there should be no reason you
can't drive down the highway pull over at
[SPEAKER_00]: the side of the road and talk to the
farmer and pick out a pick out buds from
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different bins you like you know
we're hanging up hanging up there but they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be like cobs of corn it doesn't have
to be expensive you're gonna have 12 big
[SPEAKER_00]: one ounce cobs for two bucks as long as
you can grow it in the wide open like that
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I was doing the math on doing an
outdoor in Canada and in southwestern
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario only because BC can't grow good
outdoor bud it can grow good outdoor bud
[SPEAKER_00]: in some places but they can't grow great
outdoor bud the only place in Canada that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow great outdoor bud is in
southwestern Ontario and it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: latitude as northern Cal and southern
Oregon 42 degrees the reason that makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: big difference and people you know would
know in almost any agriculture whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: was grapes or cherries or peaches the
harvest starts down south and the harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: moves north so they harvest their wine in
California in August and in BC maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: October you know Oregon and Washington in
between so the the harvest creeps north
[SPEAKER_00]: now part of the reason for this it's the
same with grass is that grass most grass
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not all but you know exceptions to
every rule but most of the stuff we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: these days is photosensitive varieties so
it stays in veg when the days are long
[SPEAKER_00]: it's triggered to flower when the days are
short hence 18 and 12 typically inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 12 for flowering you know and the thing
is in the northern latitudes or the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes because for in your case they'd
be southern latitudes but the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes have such a long day in the
middle of the summer that it seems to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant longer to snap out of veg and go
into flowering so say where I live here is
[SPEAKER_00]: like you get days that are 18 and a half
hours of daylight whereas 10 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: further south like in southern Ontario
they might only get 16 days hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: daylight in the longest days so those
plants that have never got 18 and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: hours they only got the 16 hours it's less
of a leap for them to go into flower so in
[SPEAKER_00]: BC 10 degrees further north I find the
same plants going into flower slower so by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time they do the light is getting
weaker much and much quickly you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: light is getting weaker every week so the
buds that are finishing under that weak
[SPEAKER_00]: light don't look as good maybe a little
leafier not as full whereas in southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario I would pick the same plant four
weeks earlier and it would be way riper
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so it's really something to see
the difference between those two zones and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once more people realize the quote
people out West have no clue and when
[SPEAKER_00]: people do realize the difference in
quality I think you're gonna see indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: places going out of business in three to
five years it's really just however long
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes them to license enough outdoor
back in southwestern Ontario if they never
[SPEAKER_00]: license enough the indoors will still be
in business but if they license enough the
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors will be over because we could have
full melt dry sift for the price of flour
[SPEAKER_00]: you know versus growing flowers indoors
you know this is silly we don't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee in Canada in greenhouses we buy it
from where coffee grows well we don't same
[SPEAKER_00]: with sugar you know we do great maple
syrup but we don't try and do cane sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: up here so there's there's cannabis that
works here and it's most of that is really
[SPEAKER_00]: just gonna work best in southwestern
Ontario so when the outdoor market my plan
[SPEAKER_00]: as I come back in the circle is to release
ten dollar ounces untrimmed before tax and
[SPEAKER_00]: just tops so all the smaller buds would go
for extract and then just the tops from
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the very top and then the tops
of the top ring of branches those tops at
[SPEAKER_00]: ten dollars an ounce that's cheaper than
what most LP seem to be selling grams for
[SPEAKER_00]: these days are very in the neighborhood
you know I don't know the actual stats on
[SPEAKER_00]: what all these are selling grams for
because they don't buy grams so they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: buy from LPs I'm not saying I wouldn't try
a few there's I would say two of them
[SPEAKER_00]: whose pot look worth trying but and there
were some positive reviews and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another three where I'd see some
positive reviews but they didn't look all
[SPEAKER_00]: that good and I just thought they probably
just have lower standard but I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: saying they're all bad because it looks
like there's a couple of decent ones and
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll give them that the but the
outdoor will make them all irrelevant
[SPEAKER_00]: because the outdoor can grow back there is
as good or better than any indoor as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as it's done well you can still screw it
up outside I'm not saying everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor in Ontario is better than all
indoors that's not what I'm saying but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're doing you can grow better
but outdoors there then you can't indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and in a good year too you could have a
crap year but there's always exceptions to
[SPEAKER_00]: the rule but for my money I'm backing
outdoor Southwestern Ontario for both
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and extracts and I totally think I
can do it at such a fraction of the cost
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the math I did a few years ago and
I can't remember exactly how I came to the
[SPEAKER_00]: number but I had estimated that the
country consumes five to six thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: acres worth considering flower extract
edibles you know all all sectors that five
[SPEAKER_00]: or six thousand acres would saturate the
market in Canada and it's yeah if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot less than some people think but that's
a lot five thousand acres across the law
[SPEAKER_00]: you know with the Columbia project I'm
looking at going a lot more than that and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out with less than that of course
but once I've acclimatized things I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with for the ends I want to
achieve I was really my plan is to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and I will leave it alone once I can
get it planting harvesting and processing
[SPEAKER_00]: two square kilometers a day that's my goal
for the equatorial project because I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to come out with vitamin THC and vitamin
CBT and vitamin CBN and have these things
[SPEAKER_00]: made so inexpensively that people stop
looking at them as you know a rare drug
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rich and just start looking at it
as a necessity for everyday people in all
[SPEAKER_00]: walks of life at any price point I want I
want to make it as ubiquitous as you know
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirin so that you see you can get a
reliable your aspirin is aspirin whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you get it in Sydney or Stockholm it looks
the same taste the same it is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: right and it's and it's affordable the
poor people they don't say some days they
[SPEAKER_00]: might but overall many people can afford
aspirin and I don't think you should have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be rich deserve aspirin you know that's
just it shouldn't be for the top 10
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the wealthy world it should be
for everybody and and cannabis always has
[SPEAKER_00]: been from the beginning of time it's been
the poor man's herb it's been the herb of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kings as well and the Kings maybe got the
dragon tears pressed from the edges of
[SPEAKER_00]: their hashish but they and the poor people
might be boiling stocks of low-grade
[SPEAKER_00]: plants but it's been there for everybody
and in the Middle East in Asia in Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: you name it cannabis has been there for
human history for so bloody long and the
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute gall of politicians that feel
they have a right to to persecute us for
[SPEAKER_00]: its use when it's one of the basic human
foods you know it's it's everything it's
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I don't have to tell you people
if you're listening to this show you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot I know that and if you've listened
this long you might be as crazy as me yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: well one thing I wanted to quickly ask is
you've made it pretty obvious that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: into growing organically but I wanted to
ask what is your opinion on hydroponic and
[SPEAKER_02]: salt-grown weed in general do you think it
can ever compare you know what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly done it all and and my best
hydro I did you know totally enjoy it I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: leech the hell out of it but it was using
really clean pure nutrients too the most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bottled newts that come with
coloring and all that I generally find
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's even with two weeks of people
flushing them in that I still find they
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe by the end of the joint or halfway
they start to get this plasticky smell
[SPEAKER_00]: awful there's just something I don't like
about it the whereas and I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_00]: all organic grass has done well either
because it can be overfed organic and not
[SPEAKER_00]: burn too you know there's it's not a
guarantee of quality that it's organic but
[SPEAKER_00]: I never find the most exciting weed not to
be organic let's put it that way and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you can grow fantastic hydro with
especially if you're mixing your own salts
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot and you're really cognizant of
leaching them for a totally sweet fades
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are burning really smooth and
you get a true varietal flavor of each
[SPEAKER_00]: variety you're growing because there's no
terroir and that's fine if you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: pure varietal flavor water is a great way
to go I like it with the aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: because I find it it's still that clean
but a little bit more life to it seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring out more flavor and more layers even
more subtleties it's the je ne sais quoi
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flavor the there was a study a long
time ago I remember reading in Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Alexander's growing edge he was the guy
that published sensimilia tips until he
[SPEAKER_00]: got busted and sensimilia tips really put
me on the organic path for my second the
[SPEAKER_00]: second time I ever grew pot first time I
grew pot I read a book like growers guide
[SPEAKER_00]: or something and then by that winter
before the next spring I'd found
[SPEAKER_00]: sensimilia tips in like used magazines at
the head store somewhere and buy them all
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd read all these great blends from
these old Oregon hippies and that and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh I gotta up my game and I could be
adding a lot more organic components to
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and what it came to mean to me
was that if I fed one or two things to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it was very apparent in the smell
and taste of the grass if I used a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a lot of things none of them
dominated the smell or taste of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: now case in point a plant is what it eats
it sucks up what it eats and some people
[SPEAKER_00]: will be skeptical of that and that's fine
my experience is it's fucking obvious if
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose works because I had a friend
look I was just meeting at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been we're friends for a long
time since but he came into my apartment
[SPEAKER_00]: and show me a half pound of weed and he
was a friend of a friend and he came in
[SPEAKER_00]: and before he even pulled the bag out of
his backpack I said do you grow with fish
[SPEAKER_00]: and he said what I said I said do you use
fish emulsion because one of my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: home was growing with straight fish
emulsion and his weed smelled like the
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty ass bottle of fish emulsion it
totally came through in the smell of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed but you smoked it and so I asked this
because I it just smelled like my buddy's
[SPEAKER_00]: weed because I can smell weed when he came
in but I could smell weed with fish and
[SPEAKER_00]: not live fish but dead fish and I said
this to him right as he was reaching in
[SPEAKER_00]: his bag to pull out the half pound he's
pulling out the half pound and his eyes go
[SPEAKER_00]: wide he says and he goes kind of white
he's like why did you say that I said I
[SPEAKER_00]: had a friend that grows with fish emulsion
his weed smells just like yours and he
[SPEAKER_00]: says I put a fish in every hole you know
he was just he was just he's like nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: ever people just somebody go wow that's
beautiful that's great grass you're the
[SPEAKER_00]: only person that ever said your weeds
fishy you know and he couldn't believe it
[SPEAKER_00]: so we had because you know it was just an
honest remark it wasn't wasn't trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a dick I was just being honest about it
you know and but it's so funny the the way
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant really carries whatever it's
like when you stick celery and red dye in
[SPEAKER_00]: your celery you'll turn red you think of
the grass the same way is it will pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's built out of what's
underneath it right it's not just built
[SPEAKER_00]: out of thin air so the another time the
from the first year I grew I had a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used a bag with stear manure and
that stear manure wasn't composted that
[SPEAKER_00]: long and later that that winter when I was
reading about how well composted it had to
[SPEAKER_00]: be and it couldn't smell still and it
should break up really soft and it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be wet and sticky and smell and
I thought all the shit I used was wet and
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky and smell but I didn't even think
about it until a nonsmoker at my
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend's house she had roommates
nonsmoker came into the room and said what
[SPEAKER_00]: is with that weed you're smoking it smells
like manure and they were dead serious and
[SPEAKER_00]: I were pissed and I thought it was funny
because I was naked I just laughed but I
[SPEAKER_00]: went and had a shower or the next morning
or something had a shower and when I
[SPEAKER_00]: walked back into the room it hit me
because I just smoked a joint in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: once I had a shower cleaned out walked
back in the room he's right it totally
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like manure and I realized that was
because that wasn't composted well enough
[SPEAKER_00]: that manure so then I got really adamant
about finding the oldest compost I could
[SPEAKER_00]: find and really becoming a bit of a
compost snub and that made that next year
[SPEAKER_00]: that pot that I grew the second year
having done my homework after that first
[SPEAKER_00]: year it was so good I measured everything
I see to this day against it you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just so fucking good and it was one
of the things in it about 17 things mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the whole but one of them was a
generous help things of hundred-year-old
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken compost from a chicken shed that
just got tore down and had been exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the it was just like ground soft sand
almost it was really we had no smell is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of spunky and they've hundred years
they've had a chicken coop there they
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't had chickens in it for about ten
years and tore it down and just been
[SPEAKER_00]: rained on and for a couple years and it
was so good they were really really
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional buds and I'll never ever
forget the year before the first year I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever grew I had already done a bit more
homework than my friends locally and one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them his parents were okay they lived
in the country and they said you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: some here let's take them away to plant so
he said okay so I had a sucret tin with
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000 seeds from Jamaican weed I used to
get in cans from Montreal from Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: guys there and I had those 2,000 seeds and
I went and planted them in trays and we
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted them into a little four inch
pots and we left them like that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: after once the time they were kind of
2,000 knee highs then his mom started
[SPEAKER_00]: going that's a lot of little plants I want
you to start getting those out of here and
[SPEAKER_00]: so the one day I popped over to go grab
because they were just starting to sex and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was one that was really starting to
show like a little cluster of pistols on
[SPEAKER_00]: top and it was just the furthest ahead of
anything in the female department and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just said I'm just gonna take one you guys
can have the rest of them and I took that
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant and dug a hole and planted it at
the creek near my house and that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first plant I ever grew and that was from
Jamaican and it was the only one of 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds probably that even finished the rest
of them probably wouldn't finish in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: but that one just happened to be a real
early one relatively early one and I never
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled or tasted it again until a couple
years ago when I first went to Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd visited some plants in a friend's
place near Bogota and greenhouses but the
[SPEAKER_00]: very then I flew to Rizarroda it's another
department and that's a area that's known
[SPEAKER_00]: for Punta Rojo so I thought oh I'm gonna
see some Punta Rojo visiting farms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hills here and the first farm we showed up
at I saw this plant across the yard it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a little shorter than the one I had but
it's always 12 hours there and I knew it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the same plant from it from across the
yard before I could even smell it I said
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my god that looks like the same
structure that first plant I ever grew and
[SPEAKER_00]: same coloring in that and I got closer and
it totally was and I could rub it and
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it and they're just like full circle
you know I never smelled that I got whiffs
[SPEAKER_00]: of it in things but I'd never smelled that
plant again until I went to Columbia and
[SPEAKER_00]: it totally closed the circle for me
because it was like holy shit that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: first bud I ever grew is Punta Rojo and of
course lots of Colombian seed ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: going through Jamaica so there's no doubt
in my mind that that first Colombian stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it may not have been pure Punta Rojo
may have been mixed with other Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: things or Jamaican things but it may not
have been it could have been pure Punta
[SPEAKER_00]: Rojo but it really that one expression at
least it blew my mind so it was really fun
[SPEAKER_00]: to to see that and and again as you get
older it's not always about you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: only want the latest and greatest you get
nostalgic for flavors you miss you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not the strongest one Punta Rojo
doesn't doesn't put the hurt on anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: just a nice light social smoke light buzz
but very pleasant tasting and definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you get stoned from it you just
maybe don't get as stoned from it as you
[SPEAKER_00]: might from something else that's 30% THC
but then again it's a question of degree
[SPEAKER_00]: because me with that 30% THC people are
smoking pinners of and not the same bats
[SPEAKER_00]: are smoking that other one either six or
one half a dozen of the other you're still
[SPEAKER_02]: high everybody's happy yeah for sure it's
it's hard to compare right I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly jump back though to the Genesis
story behind sweet tooth because I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember when we were able to hang out you
told me and I was like man that's such a
[SPEAKER_02]: cool story I need to get you to tell that
one again specifically the the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: male you are using yeah so the so of the
1500 plants I had in my backyard that
[SPEAKER_00]: summer and I am going to say that was 1996
and it's a bit fuzzy back then but I do
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it was 1996 that summer that I did
this big selection in the backyard and of
[SPEAKER_00]: this DJ short blueberry seed that Mark
Henry had given me I think I had five
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or six seeds or something and the
females were no great shakes I never even
[SPEAKER_00]: kept one but the male there was one male
that had a hard purple top it looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster of dark grapes pointing up really
tight balls but the amazing thing about it
[SPEAKER_00]: was it had chromatic resin is they shone
like all bearings with a metallic
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatic look to them they weren't clear
white amber cloudy they were ball bearings
[SPEAKER_00]: they were just shiny metal balls and I've
never seen that before and I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it since to see that real real
metal sheen on those trikes and so that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and and visually it was stunning
with the green leaves dark purple flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: metallic resin glistening all over I'd
never seen that present on the male either
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you squeezed it you know it
reeked of blueberry jam it smelled so good
[SPEAKER_00]: of blueberry jam and I had one of my three
grow rooms in my basement set up that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to seed so I was just gonna take
the best male from the backyard that
[SPEAKER_00]: summer and go down and pollinate those and
that's the one I chose and that the top
[SPEAKER_00]: bud of that plant I actually dried with my
coffee cups in the kitchen and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it in little bits in my bonk
because it was delicious it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: licking blueberry pie filling with every
bonk hit it was the most delicious male I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think I've even smoked other males
that male it was like I'm smoking the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and I left the side branch to take
took into the room in the basement that
[SPEAKER_00]: had plants four weeks in or something that
were and that male went off a week or two
[SPEAKER_00]: later and pollinated that room so though
that male was responsible for fathering
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tooth shishkeberry blue domino plum
bud there was a fifth one but I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember those four for sure but sadly I
didn't rejuvenate the male and keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was really thinking of it at the
time more as a backboard because the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I wanted to preserve those plants and
make that cross to the mothers to really
[SPEAKER_00]: try and stabilize a plant representative
of grapefruit for example you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: every I would try it with a different out
cross before I did the back cross to see
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones I could get to making basically
a pure sweeping grapefruit essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: that was sweet two three that was a cubed
version of it so once you back cross it
[SPEAKER_00]: twice you square it the third time you've
cubed it and assuming the mother you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with to begin with is somewhat
stable by the time you've cubed it you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a pretty good representation of it is
not exactly the same but it's gonna fool
[SPEAKER_00]: most people even myself sometimes I'm sure
I would find sweet tooth reason it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be absolute ringers for grapefruit but
most of them were pretty much pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: like grapefruit and any recessive you got
were obvious because of the blue you know
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was a fun one to do that with and I
remember the first time I met Dave Watson
[SPEAKER_00]: he came up to me at the cup and he asked
me he said you bred sweet tooth three to
[SPEAKER_00]: be homozygous he says I lurk on overgrown
cannabis world those boards he said I see
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on but I don't post or talk
to anybody but he says I've been watching
[SPEAKER_00]: and I see that you made a homozygous
strain and then tell that one the only
[SPEAKER_00]: other homozygous stream was number one he
says why did you do it and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's got a plant that they want to
get reliable seeds from but they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've only got this mother so I
want to give them a reliable backboard
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can make a cross with and then
weed out of the current the following
[SPEAKER_00]: generations you know because they can see
okay this one looks like my you know
[SPEAKER_00]: mullum bimby not like sweet tooth so I'm
gonna take keep taking the ones that look
[SPEAKER_00]: like the mullum bimby and after a couple
generations they'll have weeded the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: tooth out if they want you know but
they'll have reliable seeds of their
[SPEAKER_00]: mullum bimby relatively speaking right so
I just wanted to put something out stable
[SPEAKER_00]: of course it's easy to knock off table
seeds they're stable but you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why most seed companies of all
stripes whether they do corn or tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: or grass don't release stable seed because
a there are a lot of work and B by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you get there anybody can copy them
but for me it was like I wanted to put
[SPEAKER_00]: that into the Commons and have people able
to use it you know to do their original
[SPEAKER_00]: work with you know yeah it wasn't when I
see people that are just making knockoffs
[SPEAKER_00]: of it I'm like you're missing the point
you know this is useful genetics for you
[SPEAKER_00]: to do more than just knockoffs with you
know so I think a lot of people would
[SPEAKER_02]: realize that you know the this was
segueing into kind of like how you had
[SPEAKER_02]: that joint experience with DJ short and
most notably producing the blue satellite
[SPEAKER_02]: which has gone on to have a huge cult
following what was your recollection of
[SPEAKER_00]: that experience so actually the first
blueberry I ever grew out was that male
[SPEAKER_00]: and while it was in flower DJ was visiting
Vancouver and came over to my house and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually was able to see it in person and
he was like you've got a sweet one there
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course he looked a little a little
put like I was banging his daughter or
[SPEAKER_00]: something but he was okay with it you know
he was he was okay with it it was fun and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was some mutual respect there I'm
not just gonna make blueberry knockoffs
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not what I'm trying to do here
right so I need you to appreciate what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing and we both you know felt the
same way and I've seen this with other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders as they say why did you get into
breeding cannabis you think we just want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it easier for everybody to grow
really good stuff because we all believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a conscious evolution waiting
to happen in humanity and it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: question of getting enough tasty joints
into enough hands that people that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it wouldn't normally break out of the
mold might be tempted to buy something
[SPEAKER_00]: that just smells incredible or tastes
incredible and it shatters their their
[SPEAKER_00]: preconceived notions of the world around
us but so what happened was even we both
[SPEAKER_00]: believed in this potential evolution of
consciousness through better cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: the masses and when I got over to
Switzerland and got set up and I was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it over there he got in touch with me and
said hey I really love what you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to come for a visit and discuss
some some business making a deal I said
[SPEAKER_00]: sure come on over so him and his darling
wife came over and stayed at my place for
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit and had a look what we're doing and
said he brought a contract with me for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to sign and said he that we should do some
releases together for him to get royalties
[SPEAKER_00]: off of it's awesome so I said that's
awesome I'm honored honored that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to do that with me you know so he
sent me over or brought with him at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time I can't remember but he got about a
number of seeds into my hand including
[SPEAKER_00]: this unreleased berry sativa line the only
one he'd released was his blueberry indica
[SPEAKER_00]: line so the blueberry sativa was really
interesting one it had the squiggly leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: that we think of as TMV as lots of
blueberry does whether it's TMV or not who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows but he but there was that one and
there so there's the blueberry sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: there was the moonshine or blue moonshine
an old flow and maybe a blue velvet I but
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have just been the moonshine the
blueberry sativa in the old flow and those
[SPEAKER_00]: were kind of his main three old work lines
of seed that was old and not getting any
[SPEAKER_00]: better and needed to be grown out to do
stuff with so he I said okay let me check
[SPEAKER_00]: him out and I grew them out and of the
flow there was the most diversity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flow but my very favorites weren't the
ones with the nice yielding buds but they
[SPEAKER_00]: were this one with little popcorn nugs and
it really totally smelled like chocolatey
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepalese hash it totally had that Nepalese
hash aroma to it and the nugs were no
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger than popcorn there was no top bud
to speak of the top bud you could see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you look straight down on it you'd see a
couple of calyxes and a cluster of leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: curling upwards like a rose and from the
side the bottom of those leaves were all
[SPEAKER_00]: mauve and the insides would be dark green
but it really looked like a rose and it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled like chocolatey hash and I called
it rosebud and I hid it with a sweet the
[SPEAKER_00]: same male as sweet two three if I believe
now bx2p1 the that rosebud was my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor of any I called that that stuff we
did together I named it the joint project
[SPEAKER_00]: so I said okay we'll do the joint project
and I thought well do that with DJ maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that with some other breeders and
sell them under my joint project line so
[SPEAKER_00]: the blueberry sativa only two of them
popped and they were both females so there
[SPEAKER_00]: was no male to use again unfortunately
would have been nice and because we could
[SPEAKER_00]: have kept something going with that but I
used those two females both in a room with
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tooth three pollination and in a
room with Shishkeberry three pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: and made a blue satellite one and two is
how it started out and then there were
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent generations of each of those
but not very long and and relatively small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts so it never did a really big
production of those seeds so they were
[SPEAKER_00]: always just a small section of an indoor
room but never a whole greenhouse sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: two three I made in a whole greenhouse
same with Louie you know legends ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: indica and some blockhead I made some
seeds and really large amounts once I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: these crosses work really well we should
make a shitload you know so then I would
[SPEAKER_00]: do literally like a hundred kilos of seed
or something of a line if I really liked
[SPEAKER_00]: it and then if I was still just in the
early stages of it I consider it dating
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like not gonna marry her just yet
but we're gonna go out again and spread
[SPEAKER_00]: them around the spice testers and that too
and see see what the what happened but the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue satellites were well received and
they were not everybody loved them and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a lot of variation in all DJ
stuff you know and he'd tell you himself
[SPEAKER_00]: is there's lots of variation there's he
never worked he's the absolute opposite of
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave with number one number one was bred
to be homozygous the blueberry was made to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain populations so it was always a
population seeding that he'd been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and never trying to dial it into one Fino
so that's like when you two blue
[SPEAKER_00]: satellites were quite comparable one was a
little bit sturdier and nicer than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one but the flow there was really
quite a few distinct you know so it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: like looking at an adventure mix almost
which was always popular to me that
[SPEAKER_00]: rosebud stole the show and the moonshine
was neat we did the same cross with the
[SPEAKER_00]: moonshine with the sweet tooth DX 2p1 and
that was moonshine rocket fuel the
[SPEAKER_00]: moonshine rocket fuel was out for a little
while too but again it was kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-hit wonder I think it got bought up by
like one of our customers so it was maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: only available through heaven stairway or
one of the retailers so it wasn't widely
[SPEAKER_00]: represented like just a very three or
sweet two three those ones got to every
[SPEAKER_00]: country they were selling seeds in large
volumes so I mean there was so much shish
[SPEAKER_00]: kebari in Spain you still see shish kebari
in Spain you know in places it was funny I
[SPEAKER_00]: had when I had the blue domino in that
first crop I had a customer in Ottawa that
[SPEAKER_00]: really liked it early and sort of was one
of the first to grow out the ford said oh
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this blue domino so he
bought the rest of it and I never made
[SPEAKER_00]: another big batch of blue domino it was
just that first F1 and he bought the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have made an F2 but he bought the
whole batch of whatever domino blue domino
[SPEAKER_00]: was out so it was only available from this
store in Ottawa so people in other parts
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know it at all but if I went to
Ottawa I'd see like 20 different growers
[SPEAKER_00]: with it maybe just blow my mind to see how
regionalized some of those strains were
[SPEAKER_00]: just because they weren't released widely
so it would have been interesting if there
[SPEAKER_00]: was more of it to see what if it stood the
test of time but it may have stood the
[SPEAKER_00]: test of time around Ottawa but nobody in
Vancouver's growing any blue domino I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sure because it was all sold in Ontario
yeah well something along that note which
[SPEAKER_02]: has been of interest to me is I've always
wondered what was the land race or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: not land race but the Afghani that you
used that went into Shishkebari like and
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think I read somewhere that you
actually line worked it for a bit or is
[SPEAKER_00]: that not true yes it did it was actually
the only line the only seed lines that I
[SPEAKER_00]: released with two mothers so I would
usually well every other one I did was one
[SPEAKER_00]: mother and one female you know whereas
with the Shishkebari I had two workhorse
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghans one probably an Afghan hybrid but
very much on the Afghan side but you see
[SPEAKER_00]: different Afghans some have a little more
slender leaves some have the real webby
[SPEAKER_00]: ones and then there's some that are just
kind of thick medium most of them are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the thick medium they tend to be
thicker leaves and thicker plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are even thicker they're not a thin
leaf they're a thick leaf like cardboard
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're chunky plants they form the
basis of all indoor growing genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: they add yield to anything that they're
crossed with typically so Afghanis are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know they are to indoor what white is to
rice you know it's like the there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: red line and yellow line the red line had
red petioles on the leaves it was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more rounded top and chunkier bud but a
little stouter and the yellow line was
[SPEAKER_00]: quick to yellow as it got it went into
fade faster so it got very yellow as it
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting right and it was pointier and
it was a little taller and frostier but
[SPEAKER_00]: still had that real raw mulching leaf
Afghan aroma and both the red and yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: were fantastic hash producers so for I was
really into screening hash when you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: seed crops you get a lot of hash the one
thing about growing a seed production crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that I love is I get to smoke every resin
gland I grow and still have a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: crop without selling a single resin gland
you know I get spoiled with hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting it over time I know some people
think hash from seeded plants isn't as
[SPEAKER_00]: good I know other people's that think it's
better but it's personal preference I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think it really matters anybody
nobody complained that hit that melty
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble but those plants have really large
resin glands and crossing them both at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time with that blueberry you know in
a good chunk chunky rows of it if I had
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe five types of weed or six types of
weed in that room for that pollination so
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a substantial amount of it on
that f1 at least and then there was only
[SPEAKER_00]: more after that they were so popular the
blueberry really elevated it so you were
[SPEAKER_00]: still getting a big fat chunky frosty bud
but you would get some more fruit in it
[SPEAKER_00]: and some more color like instead of just
being all the same olive green color it
[SPEAKER_00]: would have streaks of purple and instead
of just smelling like mulching leaves it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled like a little soubois perhaps but
very much fruity you know so it was
[SPEAKER_00]: totally elevated it and still was a good
commercial option and the thing that any
[SPEAKER_00]: seed producer unless times have changed
but back then most growers really only
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in commercial seed the guys
that were growing for their head were they
[SPEAKER_00]: were still out there but they're in the
minority so I prefer to breed stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: tasted fantastic or had a nice uplifting
kick but most people really concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about yield and time and it's and bag
appeal because they're commercial growers
[SPEAKER_00]: so any seed company at the time realized
that the market was for commercial seed
[SPEAKER_00]: and Shishkebury every year would probably
be 80% of the sales because it was the top
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding plant and people want the big
heavy thing you know and to me it was not
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite flavor of grass but it was one
of my favorites for making hash would
[SPEAKER_00]: yield maybe three times the hash of the
same amount of sweet tooth trim Wow and
[SPEAKER_00]: the glands would stack up in higher
screens like you have a what the 220 work
[SPEAKER_00]: bag and then you got your 190 and 160 and
everything underneath it the 190 would
[SPEAKER_00]: melt it would bubble big shiny bubbles
like it was the resin glands were
[SPEAKER_00]: humongous on that I've never seen bigger
resin glands on any other cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: actually so I did the red and yellow lines
the f1s I kept them going and crossed them
[SPEAKER_00]: back together along the way and
Shishkebury three which was released from
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland was a bit of representation of
all three parents in one yeah okay so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting you touched on that consumer
point because when I was looking through
[SPEAKER_02]: the spice of life catalog so to speak I
like something that caught my eye was donk
[SPEAKER_02]: and the reason why was because of the fact
that like one of the parents was like kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of more of a cash cropper type of thing
from the description was that your attempt
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of offer a more commercial strain
yeah you know what that was uh there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of spice releases over the years
very few but a couple that were done by a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend of mine you know or different
friends so one early on I had a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: that did one uh called it was a cross of
mighty might and heavy hammer and we
[SPEAKER_00]: called it heavy hummer so that was the
first one that was just a seed I hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: grown but I let out under my catalog
because it was from one of my best friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and I said yeah that's pretty cool let's
put it out there because he wasn't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to start a seed company or anything and
then the donk was sort of the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a friend I had in the Kootenays and
I was out visiting him and he was like hey
[SPEAKER_00]: I just crossed this he's like what do you
think and I was like I was like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what people love giant buds so let's see
we put it out let's do it so that was one
[SPEAKER_02]: that I didn't breed but I released okay
cool do you ever did you ever consider
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to make a strain purely to suit the
consumer market or you just like look if
[SPEAKER_00]: something ends up yielding big that's cool
well the consumer were the ones buying the
[SPEAKER_00]: big stuff from the growers so the the home
growers they cared a lot less they might
[SPEAKER_00]: buy something like rosebud now I put I
don't remember exactly but I figure
[SPEAKER_00]: shishkeberry was listed in the grams per
meter grams per watt kind of thing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit you know on the higher side
sweet tooth in the middle and most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle whether it was the blue
domino or blockhead or other things the
[SPEAKER_00]: but the rosebud I think I put on it dismal
for the yield instead of you know heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: medium heavy medium I put dismal beside
yield on the description of it and people
[SPEAKER_00]: would say what does dismal mean I'd say
maybe 50 grams a square meter 70 grams a
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter oh my god that's nothing why
would I grow that if you're lucky enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke a joint of it you're like oh fuck
I would grow that for the rest of my life
[SPEAKER_00]: just for myself nobody's ever gonna be
grown that the cell until it's wide open
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and they can afford the economy of
scale but a lot of the best tasting grass
[SPEAKER_00]: is the worst yielding grass and that
doesn't compute with the indoor grower in
[SPEAKER_00]: a prohibition scenario because they don't
have the luxury of finding the luxury
[SPEAKER_00]: buyers that will pay extra to have
something exotic they have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something you know good-looking generic
bud it's got to be fat frosty and green
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the basic parameters of what they
need to sell they can't advertise it in
[SPEAKER_00]: you know rich and famous magazine so that
Arnold Schwarzenegger can buy thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar grams of it because it's that mark
it's not there yet when it's wide open
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and it can be like an auction for
domain Romany Conti like how many people
[SPEAKER_00]: get to drink a bottle of Romany domain
Romany Conti not very many you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't make a lot of wine and as a result
your supply and demand dictates that that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit is expensive and it's a luxury good
you know yeah without doubt like that too
[SPEAKER_00]: where you think geez there's only X amount
of this bud now the people that think you
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow high quality bud indoors are
missing the point it's like they think you
[SPEAKER_00]: can make high quality wine out of wine
kits it's not high quality you you might
[SPEAKER_00]: be okay with it but that doesn't mean it's
actually high quality you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more to it than just consistency
the best tastiest things like that have a
[SPEAKER_00]: year on it because they're not consistent
year to year they're a product of that
[SPEAKER_00]: year and the year that the vintage of the
harvest is it's as important to outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: you know as the variety you're growing let
alone who was growing it or taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: it who was making sure it was cured well
and dried well that year you know like the
[SPEAKER_00]: same vineyard in France may be there for
the last 200 years making fantastic first
[SPEAKER_00]: growth in Bordeaux that the winemakers
changed every 20 years over that time you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the vineyards still this famous thing
it's not the winemaker at that point it's
[SPEAKER_00]: that land that land expresses the that
variety the best and that becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized with time and some of that time
is you know we're we're at a true
[SPEAKER_00]: Renaissance in cannabis right now it
really is a mind-blowing time if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis lover to be alive like I I can
remember when I was sort of started
[SPEAKER_00]: campaigning for it as it were when I was
like 14 15 in high school debates or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot and just talking to everybody else
well cannabis has to be legal it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: not fair this sort of herb it doesn't make
sense it's part of the planet like it just
[SPEAKER_00]: struck me as evil and wrong from a very
young age and I never wasted a day not
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it with people but to think
nowadays it blows my mind I was walking
[SPEAKER_00]: into dispensaries like a year or two ago
and I'd see you know electric joints like
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-filled disposable oil pens with sweet
tooth in them and you just like if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: told me that in 96 you know I would have
believed I always believe cannabis would
[SPEAKER_00]: be legal but if you had told me I'm gonna
walk into stores one day and people that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know me you're gonna try selling me
pen electric joints full of sweet tooth
[SPEAKER_00]: oil I'm just gonna be tickled pink you
know I couldn't believe it it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like holy shit this is it's a whole new
paradigm yeah totally something that has
[SPEAKER_02]: come up in the last few episodes which you
just touched on is the idea of terroir and
[SPEAKER_02]: more importantly how can we in this modern
age establish new appellations for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis what is your thoughts on that
well they're gonna it's a excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: question and I think it is certainly an
underappreciated aspect of it's part of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that seems obvious to me but I
know plenty of people you know they're
[SPEAKER_00]: still learning their varieties and they
would rather have that well leached hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: in case the your varietal character
absolutely got no problem with that the
[SPEAKER_00]: but the thing that is increased in the
plant is in the terroir it really brings
[SPEAKER_00]: out more and it adds something to it in a
good way or a bad way you know so some
[SPEAKER_00]: places don't have a great terroir for
grass some places do and some they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: different and places with limestone and
with a lot of lime in the soil tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you limey or green buds that are
sweeter limestone sweetens grass it
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetens soil people that's how they
describe it sweetening soil limestone
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetens soil and you see it sweetens
grass the different pH effects the grass a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people will turn it down at the end
in the hydro system so the plant shuts
[SPEAKER_00]: down and stops taking up so much nutrients
each to their own there's lots of ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're trying to whatever you're
trying to do but I am I know between
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario and BC grass the same varieties I
can generally taste which province it's
[SPEAKER_00]: from even if it's grown in Rockwell and
that's to do with the water not the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: the but if you think of a one design race
is a good competition of the captain
[SPEAKER_00]: skills or the skipper skills they're all
racing the exact same little sailboat and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no technical advantage it's really
just the experience and skill of the
[SPEAKER_00]: captain and with the clone it I would like
to see competitions like this whereby
[SPEAKER_00]: grower gets the same clone and they might
be in different scenarios but they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bring you back a different bud as
a result and if you take the same clone
[SPEAKER_00]: say you took a clone of your favorite
Mullen Bimby madness and you planted that
[SPEAKER_00]: in one part of Jamaica another part of
Jamaica another part of Mexico somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in California somewhere in Oregon
somewhere in Ontario I guarantee you
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna be able to tell the
difference you may not know where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: from but you're gonna be able to say wow
this one really tastes different than this
[SPEAKER_00]: one and often I find it is even clay like
if there's some clay in the soil you can
[SPEAKER_00]: taste the clay in the herb and it is
apparent and you know this brings me back
[SPEAKER_00]: to another session with DJ short early on
it'd be the second or third time I've met
[SPEAKER_00]: him and it was first time I'd smoked his
bud was that the milk bag at a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cup in Amsterdam and he'd broader sent
over a few a few of his buds from his
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard and when we were smoking a joint
of his flow and it was the first time I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: ever smoked a joint of flow and he rolled
this joint up and passed it to me and I
[SPEAKER_00]: took one puff of it or maybe even on the
dry tote maybe before I took a puff of it
[SPEAKER_00]: you might remember if somebody wants to
ask I had the puff it whether it was dry
[SPEAKER_00]: or lit and I says it tastes like beets and
he just looked at me and smiled and he
[SPEAKER_00]: says I grew that in my beats it comes
through whatever you're putting it in
[SPEAKER_00]: comes through so that flow had the terroir
of beets because it was touching beets it
[SPEAKER_00]: was coexisting with them and feeding off
of them potentially you know it was
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped around the beets and it came
through in the bud and it was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting note I gave him was hey it tastes
like beets and and it did for a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: reason so he was quite surprised but and
he pulled out his flavor wheel had been
[SPEAKER_00]: developing and we realized we were both
really into taste we both loved good
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flavors and he's a really Zen man
and I always enjoyed his company I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: talked to him in a dog's age it wouldn't
hurt yeah that's interesting I mean if
[SPEAKER_02]: people haven't picked on it picked up on
it thus far clearly a bit of a wine
[SPEAKER_02]: connoisseur what was it that inspired you
to get into wine and what's your favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: type?
[SPEAKER_00]: well wine is a parallel universe to
cannabis they're both sort of mild
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorful intoxicants and that enhance
everyday life you know I enjoy wine as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as I enjoy cannabis probably are damn
close and I wouldn't really say I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite type but I'd like wine that's
clean not dirty and I like it and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't mind a little barnyard and
that in it I'm more technical I like wine
[SPEAKER_00]: to be very clean and I do like to try
varietal wines I also love having blended
[SPEAKER_00]: wines you know there's not a right or
wrong that way and it's not even a red or
[SPEAKER_00]: white thing I appreciate every wine on its
own merits whether it's a Riesling or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Chardonnay or a Picapoole or a Columbard
my favorite white I had in Australia was a
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbard from Primo Winery in McLaren
Vale I believe that was my favorite white
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried in Australia and I was not
expecting that much fruit from Columbard I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think anyone in Canada grows it I
was actually thinking of planting some but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I really enjoy wine and I really get
off on learning about it from people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been doing it more than me and I've
been doing quite a while 15 years I've
[SPEAKER_00]: made real wine and that's half as long as
I've done cannabis but I've been doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more the last 15 than cannabis so I
would say at this point they're fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: even as far as terms of appreciation go
and understanding the the thing is I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got one friend who's got a vineyard of
different clones of Pinot Noir and he'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make a matrix of barrels with really
high-end French barrels but he'll maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: use four different forests with a couple
different toast levels and you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: like say three sets of those so there's
three sets of the same barrels and then
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll take the three different clones of
Pinot Noir and put one into one set of
[SPEAKER_00]: barrels one into the other set of barrels
and one into the last set so you might
[SPEAKER_00]: have clone 555 and 702 remember the
numbers of the clones for the Pinot but
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between each of those
pinots is apparent but when you frame it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the different oaks it gives you a
different perception of them too but after
[SPEAKER_00]: you've tried them in all the sets then
against this matrix of them that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really a lot of fun tasting and we end up
taking breaks to smoke a joint and we end
[SPEAKER_00]: up blasted at the end of it we listen to
music and it's all fun and we really have
[SPEAKER_00]: too much fun in our wine cellars but the
but the flavors is what it's all about to
[SPEAKER_00]: us and we both love the nose and the taste
and as you get to do it you can once
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done it enough blindfolded you
could recognize those different Pinot
[SPEAKER_00]: Noirs and most sommeliers which people
think of as real wine experts he couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you what clone is in that Pinot Noir
you know it's a next level of appreciation
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they can tell you it's Pinot Noir
they can probably tell you the producer
[SPEAKER_00]: the country the vintage but can they break
down what clones are in it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always somebody that knows more
than you you know so it's really good when
[SPEAKER_00]: you can when you're humble enough to
accept that and lucky enough to learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: those people you know it's no point come
out thinking you know everything because
[SPEAKER_00]: you never learn anything after that you
always keep learning and if you enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you know it's hard not to because
you're obsessed with it yeah certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly so just out of a little personal
curiosity what's your favorite red that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm into oh you know I don't have one
favorite I rotate between between them
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy like I I get I don't not like
Shiraz but I get tired of it quick yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: really good you know I never get tired of
lackluster pinot can't take it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the but I've been drinking I have more
South American wine maybe because when I
[SPEAKER_00]: go down I take some wine with me as gifts
usually but I like to drink some South
[SPEAKER_00]: American stuff when I go out in the
restaurant so I'm always ordering Carmen
[SPEAKER_00]: Yerre or something like that I do like
Carmen Yerre and I really love like if I
[SPEAKER_00]: had to pick one fine wine which is kind of
what you're asking I think I would take
[SPEAKER_00]: Brunello de Montalcino which is typically
fantastic examples of San Giovese and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets my favorite characteristics is red
licorice when they smell like red licorice
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of my best merlots even they'll
smell like blackberry licorice like the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple licorice oh my god if they smell
like red or purple licorice I'm in love
[SPEAKER_00]: roses too and Brunello's one I often get
red licorice and roses those are the noses
[SPEAKER_00]: I want from red wine most of the time you
know I'm open to blackberry and you name
[SPEAKER_00]: it but but overall if I had to pick one
like if you're saying what's your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: if I was stuck on the desert island I
would want a cellar full of 97 Brunello's
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Berlin when they came out in 2002
and they were divine and I was supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: stockpile a bunch and save it for a long
time and or sell it back to my local wine
[SPEAKER_00]: merchant and I drank them all way too
young if I could have anything back give
[SPEAKER_02]: me a cellar full of 97 Montalcinos there
you go well I mean on a similar point of
[SPEAKER_02]: your high and connoisseur products I
wanted to know your thoughts on recently
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen a small amount or maybe you
might say a little more than small but an
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of controversy surrounding the
recent sale of $100 eighths in the states
[SPEAKER_02]: do you feel like there's room for the
extremely high-end cannabis market or do
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel like we're forever banned I think
it's not even the tip of the iceberg yet
[SPEAKER_00]: because the very best producers
historically could not make themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: known to the wider market people saw some
but where'd you get that I can't tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: you know but once everybody's able to know
then the forces of supply and demand are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to drive the price of the best stuff
up and $100 each is a tip of the iceberg
[SPEAKER_00]: man for sure and I've got nothing against
that if it was the only price for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: I have something against that but if you
can go and buy a $20 eight beside it if
[SPEAKER_00]: something's still decent I think that's
fair that's okay there's only so much you
[SPEAKER_00]: know let the let the consumers decide if
nobody will pay a hundred dollar rate
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll go away you know yeah well that's
exactly what I've kind of been thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the underlying point of the
discussion that I think gets missed is
[SPEAKER_02]: that no one who bought these eights was
forced to that's right that's a free it's
[SPEAKER_00]: free market free will whatever you want
but maybe one day I'll sell hundred dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: each but before I do I want to sell ten
dollar ounce there you go well something
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is an interesting aspect of
the whole discussion is that there are
[SPEAKER_02]: some people who say that we're forever as
a market so to speak going to be bound or
[SPEAKER_02]: we should bound ourselves by the fact that
to certain people this is medicine do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think that that argument is going to be
able to stand the test of time or it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little faulty I'm all for producing dirt
cheap medicine and I'm putting my money
[SPEAKER_00]: where my mouth isn't doing it the I'm
there's a big difference between people
[SPEAKER_00]: that need the molecule as medicine and
people that want the sexiest bud you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have medicine in a you know a
nondescript jar it doesn't have to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: sexiest bud it can be a dropper it can be
a pill and be a potion you know a cream
[SPEAKER_00]: that you rub on your hands people want to
buy boutique bud that's different than the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical market do medical people deserve
boutique bud absolutely but if they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: learn to grow them themselves they're
gonna have to learn to pay for them and if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not happy with just the raw
ingredient because mass produced field
[SPEAKER_00]: grown will make the medical compounds very
very affordable so if medical is your
[SPEAKER_00]: thing probably a tincture works for you
right yeah so if tinctures can my plan for
[SPEAKER_00]: first world pricing is I can keep somebody
medicated on field grown tinctures for a
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar a day retail so if all the patients
can be covered for a dollar a day that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna work for all but the absolute
poorest humans you know it's gonna work
[SPEAKER_00]: for most of the humans that have access to
any sort of pharmaceutical you know yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely if you can buy and you should
be able to buy cannabis and it shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be reserved for the rich but that's not to
say that boutique bud can't be for the
[SPEAKER_00]: rich absolutely can be and it always has
been yeah definitely so just to wrap up
[SPEAKER_02]: our kind of little discussion of talking
around the world the different terroirs
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatnot as we've referenced a few
times already recently you were down under
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're so in a few other places what
was your impression of the various
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis scenes and places where you
stopped in well I can tell that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation amongst many Aussies for
cannabis and there is an absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: ignorance about it by the majority so
democracy is Greek for oppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: minorities I believe it's the translation
but the but is a minority cannabis lovers
[SPEAKER_00]: in Australia face an uphill battle because
they have various authoritarian regimes
[SPEAKER_00]: descended from the Queen and they really
are not nice about cannabis in Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: overall and you and many others
recommended I don't travel with any even
[SPEAKER_00]: domestically which I never even think
about Canada just throw it in my bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: away you go but down there you guys told
me not to travel domestically with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't and I'm glad I didn't because
everywhere I went I heard the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: say oh don't forget in your bag you won't
get there with it so it was it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hard for me a little bit sad to go back to
seeing it where people were had to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more covert about it still and it took
me back in a way it was kind of a an
[SPEAKER_00]: amusing nostalgia but it was disappointing
at the same time because I know there's
[SPEAKER_00]: solid people keeping it real case in point
yourself but you know you still got a mind
[SPEAKER_00]: your P's and Q's to not have the neighbor
turn you in you know it's all it's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in the world you think of the
people getting death penalties for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and stuff it's just too much you
know why do people feel that entitled to
[SPEAKER_00]: rule us I don't get it I don't I don't
consent to be ruled in that way definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: so one thing I wanted to quickly ask you
because I should have said earlier but it
[SPEAKER_02]: slipped my mind you mentioned blockhead
and I think you you know kind of talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about body and how he was using it and
stuff one of the things I found
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting about that was I think a lot
of people would have got exposure to
[SPEAKER_02]: blockhead through snow lotus because I
think that you know got a lot of traction
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah how did how did you feel about
that when you realized that there was that
[SPEAKER_02]: was incorporated and then it was taking
off in its own right the snow lotus so to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak that I love that I love I want
people to use them in their own stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it's for and I want and I love
to see the recognition when they say hey I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean the snow lotus let's have blockhead
and have whatever else that's cool that's
[SPEAKER_00]: cool as shit I got no problem with that
even if you want to make straight up lock
[SPEAKER_00]: off knock heads if you call them square
dome and put blockhead in brackets say I
[SPEAKER_00]: made this from a blockhead that cross
that's cool too I have no problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's just when if I if there's a
potential for customers to be confused
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road which they have if they have
the authentic one or they've got this next
[SPEAKER_00]: version of it you know that that can that
leads to confusion that bothers me I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got absolutely no problem and I do wish
that guy all the best because I know when
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't talk to him ever directly but I
know his his friends were speaking for him
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're apologetic and said don't worry
the guy's gonna discontinue that give you
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the CS I don't want anything
from him I'm happy doesn't have to even
[SPEAKER_00]: stop selling them I'd rather he just
changed the name and you can still call it
[SPEAKER_00]: blockhead back cross in brackets it's what
it is that's fine but call it something
[SPEAKER_00]: that identifies it as yours so that when
other people get it they don't see oh well
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't the same as the blockhead I had
the first time or whatever you know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not trying really not trying to be a dick
about it I just want people to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really cool when they respect the
origins of what they're using I always
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to do that myself but I always gave
stuff an original name too because what
[SPEAKER_00]: you release is yours yeah not mine you
know so I mean on the topic of blockhead I
[SPEAKER_02]: did want to ask it's one of those ones
which also has or at least online it
[SPEAKER_02]: commonly says that it uses an unknown
strain as one of the parents are you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us a little bit about that one it was
the same father as the sweet tooth DX 2p1
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the most stable male I had for
hitting anything and really a vigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: specimen it had very thick dark green
leaves it was pretty much impervious to
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew it was just a real champion of a
dad that one but I used that one on a
[SPEAKER_00]: product 19 which came from an American
grower named Seuss and he was in Vancouver
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while he came up from Oregon and he
had a couple of his own strains and he
[SPEAKER_00]: kept them close to himself and he sold the
bud downtown once in a while and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people would get a seed or whatnot and
this one guy that claimed to have done
[SPEAKER_00]: some trimming for him owed me some money
and he came by and said well I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that money I owe you but I got paid in
seeds from trimming for Seuss so he says
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want I would I can pay you back in
seeds and he'd owe me money for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time I didn't even know if the seeds were
really from Seuss or what I just said you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what let's see what have you got so I
just took the seeds in lieu of the debt
[SPEAKER_00]: and I didn't grow them out in Canada but I
took them with me to Switzerland and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was two kinds there was a BKS which was
like big Korean skunk and I never actually
[SPEAKER_00]: did anything with that I think the seeds
got stolen even the and the other one was
[SPEAKER_00]: product 19 or p19 for short that was the
unknown mother if anywhere says it was
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown it was the p19 product 19 or
project 19 I was never clear on it you
[SPEAKER_00]: just always called it p19 however it was
project or product I wasn't clear on but
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really weird dude the guy was a
super weird dude and I was always under
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I was always wondering if it was
the grass that made him weird or if he
[SPEAKER_00]: made his grass weird because his vibe
because he had a weird vibe to him but his
[SPEAKER_00]: grass did too so you smoke his grass and
it was really a strong but almost
[SPEAKER_00]: off-putting for a lot of people and I know
people would say I smoked that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking out the curtains look paranoid and
wig it out like some people really got a
[SPEAKER_00]: wig out on some of the strains so it was
really unusual stuff and it was totally
[SPEAKER_00]: unrelated to everything else in my stable
so I planted those and I found one really
[SPEAKER_00]: sharp mother out of it that I liked better
than the rest and she was a big chunky
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty thing and it had a very unusual
aroma almost vinyl like you know sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: a reasoning has a vinyl smell it was very
similar to that it had this you know kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of an artificial and the and the quality
of the resin was very unusual too it was
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely greasy and when you made bubble
hash from it it actually would when you
[SPEAKER_00]: put the hash on the drying screens it
would melt through the drying screens even
[SPEAKER_00]: if you put it on like a 15 when you went
to pick it up it was stuck to whatever was
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath it and you just couldn't handle
it unless it was frozen it was really the
[SPEAKER_00]: the greasiest resin I've ever seen it was
really unusual and it was always the
[SPEAKER_00]: certain color like yeah bizarre but it was
strong and it definitely it put the wig
[SPEAKER_00]: out on a lot of people I think it
routinely I never had tested in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would see growers in the states that
had access to testing and they would post
[SPEAKER_00]: results of it cracking 30 every time
basically every time I saw a block head
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis it was over 30% so that's you
know not extremely common and it
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly wasn't 20 years ago yeah okay
I just wanted to bring up a comment made
[SPEAKER_02]: by one of our past guests Sharbad of 707
seed bank I think I've seen you even you
[SPEAKER_02]: know kind of briefly interacting with him
in the comments but he's played with the
[SPEAKER_02]: block head a little bit doing some various
filial projects and whatnot and a comment
[SPEAKER_02]: he made which really grabbed my attention
was he said all of breeder Steve stuff you
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it outdoors but it looks like it's
indoors and he said it's like all these
[SPEAKER_02]: strains are like that and you just you
never see that across a lot of breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: have you heard that comment yourself and
if so like why do you and I know why
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the case and I told you earlier was
I always do a selection round outside
[SPEAKER_00]: every year and then to inside so there was
always every year every strain was being
[SPEAKER_00]: selected to work outside but it was also
selected twice more to work inside so most
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders don't take the effort to do
selections outside and that their plants
[SPEAKER_02]: don't work outside yeah okay that's
interesting because he said that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: such a benefit because you know like he
said it a bit tongue-in-cheek but he said
[SPEAKER_02]: you know like he could pass it off for
like much more at dispensaries because
[SPEAKER_00]: they thought it was indoor constantly you
know what I've seen this so many times and
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear all these people especially today
too now that Canada is gonna allow outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these people say yeah but outdoor
socks you I was like fuck you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even tell the difference if I gave you
some proper you wouldn't have a clue is it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks just as good and it may taste even
better you know outdoor bud can be but is
[SPEAKER_00]: but if the plant is healthy and reaching
its full potential there's literally no
[SPEAKER_00]: telling if it was indoor outdoor if it was
abused outdoor it looks like outdoor if it
[SPEAKER_00]: was grown somewhere where it doesn't
really work it looks like bad outdoor but
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's somewhere where it's happy and and
the climatized there's no reason you would
[SPEAKER_00]: ever know the people that tell you that or
simply haven't experienced that yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: totally all righty well that brings us to
the tail end of the interview we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: our little quickfire questions so first
one I wanted to shoot your way what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: most memorable weed or hash or concentrate
you know anything that anything with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis so to speak most memorable
experience you've ever had with it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a tough one man that's a tough one I think
I can break it down a bit I'll say the
[SPEAKER_00]: most memorable weed was the second year I
grew at Northern Lights that stuck in my
[SPEAKER_00]: head and calibrates my bud forever the
nicest hash the most spectacular hash I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had that I made was the incredible
blue satellite the blueberry sativa mother
[SPEAKER_00]: the full melt I pulled off of her looked
like tiger's eye that gem you could see
[SPEAKER_00]: into it like rays of gold into this amber
chunk it was so spectacular I did have
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of that a long time ago this tin
I had it in it was really something I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never seen hash that looked like that
before or since that blew me away the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest the best hit I ever had was at the
legends of hash the Lebanese restaurant in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and Dave pulled out his old
Afghan hookah like a traditional one that
[SPEAKER_00]: was really like a family keepsake it was
maybe 200 years old or something like this
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a very very ornate beautiful hookah
with a solid wood pipe stem on it and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl he loaded up the bowl as he does with
full melt dry sift and it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: seven-year-old Hayes resin or something
like this an absolute full melt and he
[SPEAKER_00]: literally packed cramps of it into this
bowl and it's a room full of hash makers
[SPEAKER_00]: and hash dealers and hash lovers and we've
taken over this restaurant and he goes
[SPEAKER_00]: sets up the thing and he says who's gonna
help me light this and nobody in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to stand up and go over and hit it
and he said come on guys who's the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: stoner who's hardcore come on who's gonna
help me light this so he was ready with
[SPEAKER_00]: his wooden matches to light this big
stinky bowl of Hayes melt I remember going
[SPEAKER_00]: I was embarrassed because nobody would get
up there all looking around like no way
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to light that thing and
we're all you know happy to smoke little
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes of it and of course it was a really
extravagant hit and everybody knew it was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a long bus you know and gonna
drop them and that was one of one of two
[SPEAKER_00]: times in my life I had temporary amnesia
from cannabis and I went so I said I fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: it I got up went over to the middle of the
room crouched down took the wooden stem in
[SPEAKER_00]: my hand and he's like okay give it a big
big huff get a couple of big huffs to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing going it's like okay I take a
big long busting blast off of this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and stand up and bust a lung for a second
and go back to my table and sit down by
[SPEAKER_00]: the window at my table and I'm looking out
the window at the sort of Amsterdam Street
[SPEAKER_00]: scene outside going by and a minute later
so I look at the people at my table and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like I don't know many of these people
are looking around the room I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: who any of these people are and I was
looking out the window going fuck I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know where I am and then I was like
what's my name and I couldn't remember my
[SPEAKER_00]: name you know like I literally couldn't
remember my name and I knew it was that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was just really stoned and it was gonna
pass but it was weird because I've really
[SPEAKER_00]: had this genuine temporary amnesia from
that one blast of lighten that damn hookah
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a legendary hit I will never
forget that that was I'll be eternally
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful to Dave for that bloody hit
because it stoned me to the bone and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was great but I mean after five minutes or
something you know I just sat there
[SPEAKER_00]: quietly nobody realized I was kind of
tripping out they must have assumed that
[SPEAKER_00]: was tripping out but you know once they
got going a few people went over and took
[SPEAKER_00]: a puff of it Dave was puffing away on it
he started cork but man oh man I was lit
[SPEAKER_00]: from that and after a minute you know a
couple minutes I was sort of like okay I
[SPEAKER_00]: know where I am now if I can drink the
beer chill out you're good but that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: blast man so for the grass hash and best
hit was there another question yeah it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: follow-up is Dave a CIA agent well he
probably puffs toughest of all of them if
[SPEAKER_00]: he is I would I would not say he's a CIA
agent I can understand why some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: suspicious of Americans that get off
lightly and disappear into foreign scenes
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the issue and I think many
people facing what these people are facing
[SPEAKER_00]: in those scenarios would probably do what
they had to and not die in prison but I
[SPEAKER_02]: really don't think the guy's a CIA agent
that answers the question so next one the
[SPEAKER_02]: opposite end of the spectrum instead of
the most memorable experience well maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the same question in a different way
what was the most memorable worst
[SPEAKER_00]: experience so I'll tell you one that one
that pissed me off was when I was younger
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was 18 or 19 and I was traveling
around Central America for a winter and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was on an island key cocker in Belize and
there was a rasta about my age named Jimmy
[SPEAKER_00]: the lion and he had some nice bud from
Orange Walk and Corazol northern Belize he
[SPEAKER_00]: was out at the island and I said hey man
I'll buy some of that bud off you and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can all smoke it together because I was
visiting backpacking tourists with a few
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks and they were poor locals I said let
me buy some of that bud off you and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just smoke it together because that's
nicer than a lot of the Belizean that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: seen so I told them I said listen because
it's a small island there's a cop riding
[SPEAKER_00]: in circles around on a bike checking us
out suspiciously wherever you went and I
[SPEAKER_00]: said let's go to there was a palapa at the
end of this dock it was a private dock
[SPEAKER_00]: that was ours and we just went out there
we sat in the rafters with his radio and I
[SPEAKER_00]: said let's put all the weed into one big
joint we'll smoke it then we're going into
[SPEAKER_00]: the beach to do some fishing and then we
barbecued fish over coconut husks with a
[SPEAKER_00]: grill popped up on four coconuts and the
lime tree behind us to squeeze lime under
[SPEAKER_00]: the fish and I'd give another rest a few
bucks to go get some rice and eat great
[SPEAKER_00]: coconut and we'd boil the rice so we would
have like this rasta cookout going on the
[SPEAKER_00]: beach and we were smoking a joint and I'd
said put all the weed in that joint so
[SPEAKER_00]: that if the cop comes by we can ditch the
joint and nobody has anything on them you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and he'd he'd told me okay I put it
all in this big fat joint we would roll it
[SPEAKER_00]: in banana leaves because you couldn't get
papers and the banana leaves or almond
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves weren't too bad even if you got
them the right age but this cop drive by
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked like a kid on a bike he must
have been like 18 or something and he had
[SPEAKER_00]: his shorts and a camo t-shirt and a black
beret and I was like was that that one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cops and he's like yeah then I'm like
swat the joint out of their hand because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's about five or six of us there was
a few hippies from California in that
[SPEAKER_00]: circle and a few locals and as the cop
drove by he was looking at the joint and
[SPEAKER_00]: then looking at me and just stare me
straight in the eye because somebody was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying the Californian dread was trying to
pass me the joint and he was talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: people on the other side of him and he was
totally oblivious to this little cop on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bike riding by us on the beach and I
and so soon as the guy got past a bush I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like he's gonna come back so I swat
the joint out of the guy's hand and with
[SPEAKER_00]: my left toe I pushed it into the sand and
that cop was running right back over with
[SPEAKER_00]: his gun
[SPEAKER_00]: he's going off to us so he goes around and
he comes straight to me and searches me
[SPEAKER_00]: first and the only thing I have on is a
bathing suit with my room key in it
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing else and I'm standing on the joint
and so he's checking my pockets like he
[SPEAKER_00]: goes okay where did you do with the joint
I saw you were gonna have it I was like I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a joint and so then he went
around the circle and checked everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jimmy the lion still had a bud in his
pocket that he didn't put in the joint and
[SPEAKER_00]: so they busted him and dragged him into
their little shitty one-room police
[SPEAKER_00]: station kind of with the cell underneath
it and he I was a couple doors down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: little hotel I was staying or hostel
whatever and all night that guy sang Bob
[SPEAKER_00]: Marley songs through the bars and he kept
the whole island awake it was but I was I
[SPEAKER_00]: just stayed there the whole night just
feeling like so bad that this poor bastard
[SPEAKER_00]: is hauled in and now that you know they
may take him to the jail in Belize City
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a real shitty shitty jail and I
thought this nice young rasta guy for one
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking herb stock you know and I just
that was always been the worst buddies
[SPEAKER_00]: kill is when you're enjoying a beautiful
buzz with wonderful people and really
[SPEAKER_00]: having a good environment and then the man
comes in and kicks and in your face you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and it's like fuck you guys I really
have no respect for the law and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: because of pot loss yeah totally okie
dokie so next one if you're on a desert
[SPEAKER_02]: island and you can only have two or three
strains what would you pick mmm real
[SPEAKER_00]: original Colombian gold maybe that rosebud
or the and and the sweetest of the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: tooth the real sweet sweet tooth had a
real great candy taste like great
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipops almost you see it they I had
friends from California that thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: was great when they came to visit me on
time you're spoken like this is just like
[SPEAKER_00]: grape ape it's been around a long time and
I was like well this is a new cross but I
[SPEAKER_00]: can see maybe has similar parents or
something and my favorite sweet tooth is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually some of my favorite herbs of all
time there's a real sweet tooth there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing sweeter like just for straight up
rot your teeth sweet flavor that's it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't have any other characters that I
didn't like some herb that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet might have some kind of rot other
smells too that I don't like as much but
[SPEAKER_00]: the best sweet tooths were my favorite for
the candy flavored herb the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian gold is my favorite for a real
high cherry note and like an absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: succulent perfume totally love it but if I
had to take a third herb I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother of that rosebud that little popcorn
flow it just was like chocolate and you
[SPEAKER_00]: never have grass I had a couple of
chocolate herbs but nothing that chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: it was real hashy chocolate taste it
really reminded me in the police temple
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl the real stuff so I think those three
would be diverse enough to satisfy my
[SPEAKER_02]: palate if I could only have three no key
dokey it's a good selection so if you
[SPEAKER_02]: could have one strain back that you'd lost
over the years which one would you get
[SPEAKER_00]: back oh that's a good question there's
been a few but I think it wouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain per se but as selections I've had
of a strain that were the only time I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen true sterile females I really regret
losing those cuttings I had seeds there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a release I had called tights gunk it
was a Ryan's killer was the bag seed
[SPEAKER_00]: mother we call it Ryan's killer and when I
grew out the Ryan's killer which was when
[SPEAKER_00]: eights of pot were $40 in Vancouver twice
a year this one guy came out with some
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a friend of a friend and she was
selling herbs and she sold this other guys
[SPEAKER_00]: for 40 but when this Ryan guys came out
from lower mainland it was 55 it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: wow 55 and a why I try something okay it's
really different to it had a real
[SPEAKER_00]: sandalwood smell and taste so everybody in
my house got an eighth and they all found
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple seeds and they gave them to me so
I sprouted them and I got six plants up
[SPEAKER_00]: all three were females three of them had
pistols and three of them had no pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ones with no pistols would not
take a seed covered in pollen with males
[SPEAKER_00]: right all over them they would not make a
seed so I actually had the perfect example
[SPEAKER_00]: of sterile females I've heard of a number
of people have messed around trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make them through various techniques and
they're generally trying to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: polyploidy and I've gone back in my mind a
million times about what people were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: back then and I've got a pretty good idea
how to get back to it and it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different than what most people are trying
so I don't want to say much more about it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like it's like a great arms
race right now that whoever comes out with
[SPEAKER_00]: the sterile female first wins because what
that does for outdoor cultivation is
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing short of evolutionary if you've
got a problem with hemp in your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood which many Canadians do they
can't grow outdoors there's too much hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: around them if they had if we could induce
sterility into their plants without
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise making them different it would
be a huge game changer and even indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: producers will have a hermy and I've seen
you know customers of the biggest LPs in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada complain about getting seeds in
their bud come on people you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: still be selling CD bud if you're not
trying to sell CD bud so it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: really easy to correct that for all of
them I could take a cutting from anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: and send it back to them sterilized in a
few months the only difference in the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: would be that it didn't have any pistols
so that was really an amazing plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: find nobody I've ever talked to has ever
seen a similar one obviously whoever else
[SPEAKER_00]: grew those seeds saw it but probably
didn't realize the significance of it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time as I didn't because I'd only been
growing for less than 10 years at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point and I just thought hey I've just
never seen this before but I'm sure I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see it again I never saw it again so I
really really really regret letting those
[SPEAKER_00]: go I'd left that the house where I had
them I sold the least to a friend and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to move to another house out on the
ocean which was gorgeous but when I said
[SPEAKER_00]: listen I'm gonna move out there I'll sell
you the lease on my place the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: set up all the plants are there equipment
it's all yours so I sold him the place
[SPEAKER_00]: that I left and I said I'm gonna come back
in a couple months when I get something
[SPEAKER_00]: else set up I'll come back and get
cuttings and everything and when I came
[SPEAKER_00]: back he'd cleaned out like half the stuff
you know like and he'd lost them he's like
[SPEAKER_00]: oh I lost this and I lost that one too he
was like oh no I said fuck I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: kidding myself that I didn't spread it
around a little bit more because the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that I was so proud of early on
and shared far and wide they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still a round they're more far and
wide than they ever were because people
[SPEAKER_00]: have shared them in an ongoing way so like
a sweet skunk you know there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet skunk or grapefruit in BC let alone
in the West Coast it'll never be gone
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's out there it's you know it
would be like trying to get rid of oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point there's so much of it you're
just never gonna get rid of it yeah no
[SPEAKER_02]: totally okay so on to our lucky last
question if you could go back in time to
[SPEAKER_02]: one place to collect land-raised seeds any
place any point in time where would you go
[SPEAKER_02]: and what would you get
[SPEAKER_00]: hmm I think I would go to equatorial
Africa 2019 I love the good African
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorial streams there's Congo Nigerians
and Angolans and I don't think they've
[SPEAKER_00]: changed that much in the last thousand
years you know maybe they have but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know they they they really have some
amazing aromas and a little different
[SPEAKER_00]: effect being that they're a little higher
in THCV than many other places yeah it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not that I need to go back in time I just
need to go and travel through some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas that I think still hold
amazing land-raised stuff you know like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to Angola the chances of everything
being polluted with blue cush are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: low but if you smoke Angola and I know
friends in BC that grow Angolan it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulously delicious it really is and it's
nice is up there with some of the Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: ones but I get a little bit better even
than like Burmese and Vietnamese and that
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to like the Africans just a hair
better than the Asians and I like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Asians but I love the Africans so that's
where I would for land-raised collection
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where I would want anything from
equatorial Africa yeah what a fantastic
[SPEAKER_02]: answer so with that being said did you
have any comments or shout outs you wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to make well shout out to everybody that
ever supported me in this endeavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: your encouragements always meant a lot I
would have done it for my own selfish
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure as I said I love to do it but you
know the vindication I felt from all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that ever helped me along the way
my gurus that mentored me and took me in
[SPEAKER_00]: to a degree like it wasn't like they were
became my parents or anything but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of good advice from some
really good people over the years and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you know as one out of the blue I
would take that Tom Alexander from sense
[SPEAKER_00]: Amelia tips I brought up earlier because I
never made the point out of that what I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to make was they had a study
following sense Amelia tips he had growing
[SPEAKER_00]: edge and they had the study I remember
reading that showed that organic produce I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they did it on tomatoes the study
that it provided they had an organic one
[SPEAKER_00]: in the non-organic tomato and the
non-organic tomato had the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids of a tomato you could tell it
tasted like a tomato it was a tomato but
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic stuff grown in compost and
whatnot had developed secondary flavonoids
[SPEAKER_00]: so they were able to quantify the improved
flavor in the organic produce through the
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance of primary and secondary
flavonoids that study confirmed what I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt that the organic pot tasted better
and I always thought organic you know your
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard tomatoes taste better than those
pink ones at the supermarket and really
[SPEAKER_00]: you know shout out to Tom Alexander for
sense Amelia tips and then onwards and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing edge and the science of people
growing kind but and especially I you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to thank anybody that ever bred
seed in this planet before me because we
[SPEAKER_00]: all stand on the shoulders of giants you
know and I really you know have nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: but respect for guys like DJ short and
even Watson what he's done with skunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Connell Clark you know without his
book marijuana bought me I'm sure I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been off to a much slower start but
that was the second grow book I ever read
[SPEAKER_00]: and that really blew it up for me and
brought it into perspective and I'd read
[SPEAKER_00]: it after you know I think the first year I
grew then I got some books and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the very first books I got and I
read it and look at the drawings of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different lines and think wow there's so
much cannabis to experience beyond you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the sensey catalog so it was really a
treat to it was really inspirational
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Connell Clark I really felt a debt
of gratitude to him for his excellent work
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's done a great job I'm sure there's
lots more people I could thank but this
[SPEAKER_00]: has been a very long show already and I'm
sure you're all ready to go roll another
[SPEAKER_02]: one that's a good little sentiment to end
it on so thank you so much Brita Steve for
[SPEAKER_02]: coming and dropping all the knowledge and
all the awesome history it's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure thank you again for your
