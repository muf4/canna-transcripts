[SPEAKER_01]: And as usual, I'd love to hear what are
you been smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you haven't puffed yet, what do you
plan to smoke on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't puffed yet mostly because it
finally stopped raining around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing a bunch of yard work,
but I have a I have a embarrassment of
[SPEAKER_00]: riches right now mostly from friends of
stuff and some of we chatted about last
[SPEAKER_00]: time but train wreck blue dream loop that
loompa headband my headband sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: chem d A bunch of some Death Coast diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of stuff Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I I don't actually repeat very often These
last few weeks because I've gotten enough
[SPEAKER_00]: samples that life is pretty good right now
as far as that goes I Love that sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're spoiled for choice and it's
probably not surprising to any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners that that's the way it is You
mentioned a few really interesting names
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear Which of those lot do
you think is the standout to you so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: out of all those I would say that I Mean
this might sound like a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: Homer ism or whatever but the the what I
call the LA the headband That I have like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably in my top three or four
things all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Especially like when I'm at home and I
don't have to go out in public I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like it a whole bunch sometimes if I'm out
in public I get too baked on it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me feel like I'm a little bit in the
Twilight Zone and like I shouldn't maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: be at a grocery store that lit up or
whatever, but Yeah, I like Headbands chems
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm almost out of chem D just
because I keep smoking it so much I've not
[SPEAKER_00]: been very good at regulating my amount,
you know, so Yeah, it it's gonna be a sad
[SPEAKER_01]: day soon when my little my jar is gone
We'll all have to pull one out for the
[SPEAKER_01]: homie at that time I would love to ask you
well before we get to the chem stuff you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned You know the LA and in the past
Episode you mentioned that it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani sort of plant If I had to put it
to you and get you to tell me you're the
[SPEAKER_01]: absolute best Afghan in your opinion Be it
a line or a particular cutting What would
[SPEAKER_01]: you go with or even if you would just want
to say like a certain region, you know But
[SPEAKER_01]: what would be your pick best Afghani?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it really hasn't changed in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's pretty much for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Chem 91 And the reason for that
is basically like it's got like my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite Afghani high When I smoke it I
feel like you know that feeling you got
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you're in high school and you
get really baked and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're you have the munchies and
you're gonna watch a comedy with your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and you're like just warm and
happy and content Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all weed is happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of its anxious some of its little
racy some of it can Have these different
[SPEAKER_00]: elements But the Chem 91 to me is just
really potent and it's also like very warm
[SPEAKER_00]: and very comforting You know and it's
interesting too because it's it's ugly and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not very frosty and it kind of looks
like dinosaur weed in the sense It looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like some kind of ancient throwback plant
Especially by IG standards today if nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't think you would pick it out of a
lineup in terms of what you think via
[SPEAKER_01]: Pictures would work the best, you know
Yeah, it's certainly it's undeniable that
[SPEAKER_01]: a the Chem D looks a lot better than the
Chem 91 And also, you know that the Chem
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 is is really unlikely to win a beauty
contest No, it's it's ugly and I mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: can make it look pretty but it's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really that frosty You know its
smell comes and goes kind of sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: hit it out of the park and it tastes And
smells delicious and then the next three
[SPEAKER_00]: times you grow it if you can, you know,
it's in there, but it's not very prevalent
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the most important thing to
me generally speaking with any weed is
[SPEAKER_00]: effect and it has effect in spades it
really It packs a punch and it does it
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatedly and you don't really get a big
tolerance to it to me Like it works pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly, you know certainly certainly
look you you sort of Humbled into this
[SPEAKER_01]: question I wanted to ask you but I've got
to unpack it a little bit But I love the
[SPEAKER_01]: way you described that it makes you feel
like you know when you're in high school
[SPEAKER_01]: getting high for the first time those sort
of nostalgic feelings What I've noticed is
[SPEAKER_01]: that exotic weed as a broad term Tends to
be all the craze among the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: generations those people who are in high
school Whereas Chem Dog is often thought
[SPEAKER_01]: as being more popular among like the older
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering do you think this will ever
switch and we'll get to the point where
[SPEAKER_01]: like Chem Dog has some more meaningful
popularity with the younger generation And
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of in line with what you're
referencing that you smoked it back then
[SPEAKER_01]: and you were like, wow, this is the best
thing ever It's interesting that these
[SPEAKER_00]: days they lean more towards the exotic
Some of that is not their fault In the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that you know it a lot of it comes
down to access Right You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure like for instance, you know
Episode one of your podcast your access
[SPEAKER_00]: has probably gone up exponentially with
interviewing all these people and making
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and connections and all that type
of stuff and getting to try different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and so You know being that weed is
still illegal And then it is you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is even in the states where it's
quote-unquote legal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really legal It's pretty much
like highly regulated and highly taxed So
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people that are producing stuff
are producing stuff of what they think the
[SPEAKER_00]: market currently wants and so as a result
of that like a lot of young people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 90% of their options that they know
what to get are exotic I'll use a
[SPEAKER_00]: different example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if old people were telling you
that one of the best bands that they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: ever they'd ever heard was Led Zeppelin,
but you couldn't go out and find a record
[SPEAKER_00]: or Or listen to it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't available anymore Like you hear
rumors of people having albums of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you actually couldn't experience it
right and so I think a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: popularity is Access and I also think that
you could take almost any strain forget
[SPEAKER_00]: about chem for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take dozens of different strains
that were that we consider to be elite
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe have sort of fallen off the
popularity where the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokers have never tried it They've just
heard about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order for for some of those
classics to outpace The Zaza or the
[SPEAKER_00]: exotics or whatever you want to call it
today people would have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know vote with their wallet and
Get it, you know You'd have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: walk into a store or your dealer would
have to be like do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some gelato 45 or do you want some chem D
or do you want some dog chips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want some jealousy by Julie,
you know, like they'd have to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: option, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly look I I wholeheartedly agree
with you and in part this sounds like a
[SPEAKER_01]: call to arms, you know Everyone listening
to the show you need to grow a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: chem Deseminated into the community But no
like to play devil's advocate here The
[SPEAKER_01]: Jungle Boys have put out a crop of what
they called chem dog 91 and I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if it was popular enough that it merited
it to come back But what I will say is I
[SPEAKER_01]: also heard a rumor from someone that they
were using the the JB cut Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's also kind of one of those
things where it would take some time and
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know, I You know a lot of times
people it's weird because in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that were really good sort of
organically got the elite label Which is
[SPEAKER_00]: it slowly spread and the more and more
smokers that desired it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where how it gained popularity to
some degree we're now modern marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: exists and so people get told what's good
and that affects perception in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: to Right, like if you know, maybe a better
way to judge, you know if we're gonna use
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91 as an example take some kind of
exotic and Take chem 91 and put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint and don't tell people which is which
so they have no indication right because
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're not bringing Your biases into
it and I don't think the Jungle Boys grow
[SPEAKER_00]: very good weed to be honest You know,
you know, I don't I think they grow you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a commercial quantity and I don't
think that You know, we haven't gotten the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure yet for quality to really win out
in the marketplace It's more like who has
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses and who's able to do it and then
the economics sort of dictates that they
[SPEAKER_00]: blow out Large amounts of good-looking
weed to try to stay ahead of the taxes and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the fees and all the polls on the on
the money So I don't really think we've
[SPEAKER_00]: hit like a legal connoisseur grade yet in
my opinion The weed you could get in clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 215 era Was you had a chance of
getting nicer weed on average than you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get today?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it permanently has to
stay that way, but it's that way currently
[SPEAKER_01]: On this topic in you know You mentioned
earlier having the licenses and the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities to go ahead a lot of growers
who were Producing the killer bud that you
[SPEAKER_01]: used to be able to say get it a dispensary
a lot of them are feeling pushed out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the market the overwhelming majority of
them haven't been able to secure like a
[SPEAKER_01]: Larger license and facility that would
allow them to keep going What would be
[SPEAKER_01]: your general advice for any of shall we
say, you know the the old school growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are feeling like they're being pushed
out of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they need to maybe find like
a unique?
[SPEAKER_01]: Space like a niche or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can fill or like what would be some
general advice you might offer?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually it's that's kind of a big
subject man So I'll try to break it into
[SPEAKER_00]: chunks and where I live in Mendocino
County It sort of is the question of the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment because unlike a lot of other
places this place sort of rose out of
[SPEAKER_00]: poverty post logging with the the rise of
medical cannabis And so it's like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more important to my local area than it
might be to a lot of other places You know
[SPEAKER_00]: because I mean I think about it all the
time and I talk about it with friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: like even if we make it what if the
community as a whole falls apart around us
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the place That we love and the
place our kids go to school and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all this different stuff becomes like,
you know, just very difficult and I I
[SPEAKER_00]: might sound a little political here a
little punk rock or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: when I say this but Like I mentioned
before I don't think weed is legal Yet I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's highly taxed and highly
regulated like the idea that Name one
[SPEAKER_00]: other legal plant That you have a plant
limit and grow in your backyard,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if i'm a tomato if i'm into heirloom
tomatoes I I can take my my backyard and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow thousands of heirloom tomatoes I
can breed those tomatoes to try to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: better one than i'm into I can share those
seeds with my friends You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only rules or regulations I might hit
upon are if I try to commercially sell
[SPEAKER_00]: them then I might need like a tax id or
some kind of like But in terms of just
[SPEAKER_00]: like non-commercial aspects There is no
there nobody nobody cares, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So The way it is now legally where you're
like, oh you can have six plants You've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing this podcast long enough that
you can't have a mother room with six
[SPEAKER_00]: plant limitation You can't you can't breed
and make selections for what you want with
[SPEAKER_00]: the six plant limitation Um, it's not
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's world Will allow you to do it if you
give us a bunch of money and jump through
[SPEAKER_00]: a ton of hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my general gist is like Maybe i'll put
it this way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh from my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been telling me you shouldn't do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a bad person You shouldn't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a bad person Stop doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna put get you in trouble if we
catch you doing it And we've been fighting
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole time to make the rest of
america be like, oh That opinion is dumb
[SPEAKER_00]: These people should be able to do whatever
they want because they're not hiding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not harming anyone This is
preposterous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now they've switched it and they're
like man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing you've built is pretty cool
We'll take it from here Right,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the direction that they're going to
take it Is not the direction that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have been involved in cannabis
a long time want it to go So to me the
[SPEAKER_00]: fight hasn't stopped The fight has gone
from you can't have it to we want what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have and then you can go away Right,
so for me it's like you're still fighting
[SPEAKER_00]: now the problem becomes is that When we
were fighting to just have it before
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition made having it lucrative So
it's sort of like funded the resistance if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were You know what i'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the whole concept, uh, you're familiar
obviously with One of the first forums
[SPEAKER_00]: overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Do you know why they named it that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow the government Overgrow the
government, which is basically laws only
[SPEAKER_00]: work if a majority of people Think the law
is a good idea and respect it Right one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the big reasons why they ended prohibition
when alcohol in america was because so few
[SPEAKER_00]: people agreed with it on average that it
led To a general breakdown in trust but
[SPEAKER_00]: for cops for the government for law making
You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually if enough if you live in a
democracy You can't have laws that the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the people think are total
bullshit Like it's a it's a there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: friction there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we've gotten to this idea That
it's happened in enough states where I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's pretty I don't think we can
ever go back To prohibition in turn with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis like full prohibition because Too
many people use it and like it and too
[SPEAKER_00]: many people have seen it go recreational
or medical in their state and It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's gone mad max and society has
fallen apart, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's more about For people like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you steer it in the direction that
you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the that's the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fight hasn't really stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Changed now the the part of it
that becomes difficult is that before when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were fighting Like I said prohibition
made cannabis very lucrative So if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were willing to risk your freedom to grow
cannabis You probably could make a good
[SPEAKER_00]: living and then you could sort of fight
the system as it were You know um,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as they've you know as they've
legalized things and the prices collapsed
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where do you where do you get
the funding to keep pushing for things as
[SPEAKER_00]: it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I don't I don't know if this is
necessarily the show to talk about this or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever But what the government thinks is
happening with weed Versus what's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happening with weed in terms of
recreational and legal is so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost it's almost silly,
you know, like they have no idea what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on they don't and You know,
so the question becomes for people like
[SPEAKER_00]: us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: uh is You know We're probably both in the
same boat of we would we would prefer as
[SPEAKER_00]: many old and important things to be
preserved as possible for It's fine to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bunch of what we would call mids or
kind of goofy stuff or whatever because
[SPEAKER_00]: some people Just want to buy a big case of
cheap beer and they're happy with that
[SPEAKER_00]: like there needs to be Cheap weed,
hopefully that's still pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, but cheap weed for people that
That's their economics But what i'm hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: is that eventually we'll be able to get a
higher grade of weed Will lead to a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: price Just like with watches or cars or
italian leather shoes Or organic food or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else there's like grades,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can go to the store and I can buy a
three dollar bottle of wine Or I can buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: three hundred dollar bottle of wine Right
and Legalization really hasn't allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: that quality to happen yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically like Who can do it and the
economics of it are really messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then who can survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: While doing it, you know And I don't know
how politically you want me to get on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one, but it's basically it's it's a really
tough time right now I've never actually
[SPEAKER_00]: been more scared of diversity surviving
than I have right now um And I do feel for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone um because most people You know
most people aren't uh, I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it the right way this I don't want
this to sound the wrong the the like
[SPEAKER_00]: elitist or anything like that,
but most people aren't like us and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean by that is that Most people are going
to even growers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people Weed is going to fit within a
certain framework in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what i'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah like there's only going to be a small
group of people that Weed is like their
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their passion It's what they spend a
ton of time thinking about and pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: forward like to use a different analogy or
something like there might be some people
[SPEAKER_00]: that fish right and then there might be
guys that like Own all this specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: fly fishing gear and they plan their
vacations around where they can fish And
[SPEAKER_00]: they just like kind of you know,
it's important enough to them That it
[SPEAKER_00]: means a lot more than your average
fisherman Right, you know who might
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally go out there and do something
or might be the same with classic cars or
[SPEAKER_00]: stereos or anything else You might want to
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that are not interested
mildly interested Kind of deep into it
[SPEAKER_00]: where you start learning about some things
and then there's a small core of like
[SPEAKER_00]: diehards Who really live and breathe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: In almost any hobby Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like you just sort of talking about
like let's talk about Anything where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like plus two standard deviations
above the meme, you know, like you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: like the top 0.3 percent It's the most
extreme end of the spectrum you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that and that's not making me
but like that just might be like I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: joke about it like that likes a lot of A
lot of weed people might have a touch of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tism, you know or something like that
Like we like, you know, like we're like
[SPEAKER_00]: rain man out there like we're in this one
little area Like we know a lot right And
[SPEAKER_00]: then people that aren't like us they're
like, why do you care so much about this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right and so I get that even up
here even in Mendo people have a
[SPEAKER_00]: Misconception about Mendo and Trinity and
humble I would say most of the growers up
[SPEAKER_00]: here Like it did fit like they did it
because it was the biggest economic driver
[SPEAKER_00]: of their area and it supported their other
interests in their life But a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people figured out a way to grow a certain
Style with a certain couple strains make
[SPEAKER_00]: money off it and they didn't care to learn
more than that Like that was fine for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fit their movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those people Are gonna have a much
harder time because they they existed
[SPEAKER_00]: basically because there was prohibition
and there was inefficiencies and And all
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's people that have been growing
up here for 20 years that haven't really
[SPEAKER_00]: been refining their craft The whole time
it'd be like it'd be like if you were a I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if you were a You know a doctor
or something like that and you never
[SPEAKER_00]: bothered to learn anything post med school
Yeah, okay fast forward 20 years and you
[SPEAKER_00]: might know a chunk but some of it might be
kind of outdated and there might be new
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and new things going on that
really matter that just slipped by you and
[SPEAKER_00]: most people up here and in weed in
general, it's like they liked,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know It was like one of the things
with it was one of the things that got it
[SPEAKER_00]: made a decent amount of money You weren't
around a bunch of real criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like gave you sort of like a freedom to
be independent And there's nothing wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with weed works for you in that range Most
of the people that you talk to not all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them some of them fall into that category
in my opinion I won't say who because it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't matter but a lot of them that you
talk to are our weed nerds right like
[SPEAKER_00]: They've embraced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like if I if I won a hundred mil
there's a bunch of weed growers that if
[SPEAKER_00]: they won a hundred million dollar lottery,
they would probably never grow weed again
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would hire my friends and start some
kind of like nursery art research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development thing and start messing around
right and so You know it it that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why a lot of strains get lost right
because it's only a few weird nerds
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding on to why are you holding on to
someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's old and unpopular Right
That's sort of really good advice for
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know the advocacy needed and the
direction to help steer things moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward I guess if we had a more sort of
How shall we say like savory look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: accounting for the way things have gone
thus far When we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity, do you think it is that
unreasonable that in like 20 years time
[SPEAKER_01]: the big corporations May have consolidated
we're smoking glass house mountains if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want the mids we're smoking alien labs if
you want the Zaza and Like there's just
[SPEAKER_01]: not really any home growers left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's possible at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think that's like a bit too
far-fetched?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible, but that would be that
would that would be regulators Stomping us
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at it from a look at it from a
Related but a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay in America when when I was a kid up
until not even really all that long ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for a long time you could go into
grocery stores and You like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were talking about it offline before we
started but You got the vegetables and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits that made the most sense for the
producers to produce to put into that
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery store right and They had
production models.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had cucumbers And tomatoes and all
these different things that fit that
[SPEAKER_00]: production model, but because it was
totally legal There was this whole small
[SPEAKER_00]: little group of weirdos There was trading
heirloom varieties of every different kind
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginable and they did that for decades
When the only place you could get that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff was at farmers markets right
and then eventually people were like man
[SPEAKER_00]: these tomatoes taste pretty watery and
bland and There's these other tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they taste delicious And they started
going to like these co-ops and these
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie You know places that had some
better grades of food and stuff and they
[SPEAKER_00]: started tasting these different veggies
and they were like man these are
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible and Then some of these big
grocery stores start carrying these lines
[SPEAKER_00]: because enough customers demand I want
heirloom tomatoes in this store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't I get summertime seasonal
delicious?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not just this one type and so I
think if they open it up and they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make it fully illegal whether or not
Whether or not it becomes like
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially viable there will be a small
group to a medium-sized group that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and trading and saving things and
pushing it forward and doing the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that interests them and they won't give a
shit about What's going on in the bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: world?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that that doesn't work is if they
make it illegal for anyone, but the large
[SPEAKER_00]: producers right so it's like big
corporations controlling all of it is fine
[SPEAKER_00]: as Long as you allow the little guy to do
what he wants now would I prefer big
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations to control everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I also live in America and I watch
how most Industries are controlled by
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively few groups think about Think
about another thing which is not an exact
[SPEAKER_00]: analogy because it's not plants but It is
kind of similar after prohibition ended
[SPEAKER_00]: for alcohol For about 70 years Americans
had their choice of what kind of crappy
[SPEAKER_00]: pilsner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got bud bud light cores old-style
Pabst You know like the heady beer when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into a bar was Heineken literally and
then now What's happened is probably 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the market is what it's it's craft
breweries Bringing all this different
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that was always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just big corporations offered you
here's Here's a bunch of shwill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that Budweiser like for actual
Budweiser beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes about half the barrels of
Budweiser that it used to from the 90s on
[SPEAKER_00]: and It's replaced that by buying micro
breweries because there's this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Segment of the population that likes to
drink beer, but it doesn't want to drink
[SPEAKER_00]: that grade of beer anymore It wants to
drink a different grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to drink, you know stouts or IPAs
or ambers or box or you know some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing like that and It's they become
economically important enough that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to cater to them to some degree So
what can happen to weed is still wide open
[SPEAKER_00]: but The way I look at it is kind of punk
rock in the sense of like we we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: been given what we want yet So the fight
isn't over This is sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization and rec weed is sort of like
they're losing and this is like their
[SPEAKER_00]: fallback position Of like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll give it to you But it has all
these rules and you have to do it like
[SPEAKER_00]: this and we need to keep saying no No,
we want it like this Like we want it like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even like even stores Eventually
what probably is going to have to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: in order for quality to really rain is you
would have to allow You know
[SPEAKER_00]: direct-to-consumer sales Because what
happens is right is that in the current
[SPEAKER_00]: model?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk into a dispensary to buy weed
You can only buy the weed that just the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary has pre chosen to buy to sell
to you They could be like I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy this Neville's haze Doesn't look nice
and you want more for it What does that
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the consumer doesn't get a
chance to buy it so by only having these
[SPEAKER_00]: certain regulated stores that can sell it
you give those stores a lot of power over
[SPEAKER_00]: what the consumer gets to gets to see and
Then the growers are gonna want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: What the what the middleman and what the
dispensary is willing to buy But that that
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be who's determining what weed
is out there consumer should Yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like I mean to me it feels like
there's a lot of parallels with yet the
[SPEAKER_01]: beer and the wine Industries you see where
it's like, you know A lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into like these natural styles of
wine and these craft beers and it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: about accessibility I certainly have
wondered with cannabis specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always felt like the wine especially
In Europe, they were really there was
[SPEAKER_01]: something about the the Appalachians which
allowed there to be like To put it simply
[SPEAKER_01]: in wine, you know some wine goes for like
thousands and thousands of dollars a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle and there's a decent and the people
who are in those vineyards make good good
[SPEAKER_01]: money off it Oh, yeah, and so I sort of
thought how can we do the same thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis where you can still grow it
yourself and maybe if you're in a good
[SPEAKER_01]: area you can fetch a pretty penny for it
because I think if I Try to and correct me
[SPEAKER_01]: if I'm wrong from extracting all of what
you've said It's basically that the more
[SPEAKER_01]: variety the better for everyone in every
regard But also never see the right to
[SPEAKER_01]: personally grow because we need to have
the small home growers Yeah, I mean I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: use I'll use the analogy again imagine if
if your record store refused to carry Led
[SPEAKER_00]: Zeppelin and You didn't have the choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you couldn't hear it Right,
you know But I do think that you're right
[SPEAKER_00]: in that I don't know if I use this analogy
in the in our previous chat So if I did I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize but I think it does matter in
that if you go back to like say like the
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s and in the United States Most people
had almost no knowledge of wine The the
[SPEAKER_00]: regions that are famous for wine now like
in California and stuff like that We're
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of really getting going back
then you would say that like most
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans their knowledge of wine was like
white wine is for the wife and it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: with fish red wine is from is is like
meats and roasts and steaks and they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of knew red and white and after 40 years
of You know education and the populace
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that are like they know
what Napa is they know what regions are
[SPEAKER_00]: they know like Oh, I like Zinfandel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like merlot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this Appalachian for my pinot gris
I like you know, because there's all this
[SPEAKER_00]: information and then you get enough nerds
that are pushing it forward and you go
[SPEAKER_00]: into like a Heady wine shop and the guy
working there has his favorites and he
[SPEAKER_00]: knows tons of information about it and
he's like Preaching to like the customers
[SPEAKER_00]: about what his favorites are and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: weed needs to have that kind of thing
because what's happened with weed is that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning you only had access to
like what the dealers you knew had and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it was like what they had access to
and like what they wanted to buy and now
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've got stores, it's opened up a
bit, but it's like the choice that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: the taxes are so high and the pressures
are so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really haven't opened it up yet to
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really haven't graded out like what
the differences are in weed and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times with these mylar bags and everything
like that like people don't even see the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed until they've purchased it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so there's a lot of improvements
that need to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that like all these laws that
have happened right now, a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: need to go, but they're like the first
baby steps, right and the other the other
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting component, which I don't know
that Australia is a pretty big country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you get this there, but in
America, we're so big that we grow crops
[SPEAKER_00]: where the climate suits the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, like we grew, you know,
we used to grow oranges in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California or oranges in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow, you know, maple trees grow in New
England, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow almonds in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow potatoes in Idaho, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figure out where the climate suits the
crop and that's where the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop gets grown because it's cheaper to do
it that way because the climate suits the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have right now is we have this
weird thing where every state that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: legal or recreational or medical is its
own island because the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't allow interstate commerce.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So California can't send its weed anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana can't send its weed anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Massachusetts, Colorado,
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like you've got this
captive group of people that just have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take what's on offer in your little state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nowhere for the overproduction
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, the best
states there's going to come a time when
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes federally legal, where most of
the places that are setting up to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis won't grow commercial cannabis
because the climate isn't as suitable as
[SPEAKER_00]: other areas of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they'll probably end up
growing indoor where the power is
[SPEAKER_00]: cheapest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you can ship it anywhere in the 50
states or you could ship it international
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, they're going to set it up
where it makes the most sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned Glasshouse or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like their whole business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their whole business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it stays the way it is for the next 10
years, they'll probably fail as they burn
[SPEAKER_00]: through investor money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their whole point is to have a hundred
acres and eventually they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to ship to other parts of the
country that can't grow as good a weed as
[SPEAKER_00]: California can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's big corporations that are setting
up that are hoping that we go federally
[SPEAKER_00]: legal because otherwise they'll fail in
their little state that they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what I think about though is
people like Bud Light and Heineken,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some of these more sort of everyday
man beers, they're very much accepted in
[SPEAKER_01]: the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: From us heady guys, there is still a lot
of grievances with some of these midsy
[SPEAKER_01]: brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think in time that'll equalize out
and it'll just become accepted that this
[SPEAKER_01]: is in fact like beer and wine and these
guys are trying to be literally the Bud
[SPEAKER_01]: Light of cannabis and there's nothing
wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that because of the way
modern marketing works, every single
[SPEAKER_00]: license holder will tell you they are
trying to grow the best cannabis on earth
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have the terpiest, flaviest,
highest THC, best weed you can buy and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why you should buy it from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find a brand that wants to tell
you, we definitely want to be the Bud
[SPEAKER_00]: Light of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get them to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might grow Bud Light, but they're
going to try to tell you that it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: most exclusive, rarest fire on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be wrong, but I think that guy
who wrote Three A Light has come out on
[SPEAKER_01]: the record being like, yeah, this is not
going to produce the best quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and the problem too, this might
get into the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that, but one of the
issues with legal cannabis in America is
[SPEAKER_00]: that because it's illegal at the federal
level, banks won't touch you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard that even getting
and maintaining bank accounts for quote
[SPEAKER_00]: unquote legal businesses can be very
difficult because these banks are
[SPEAKER_00]: multinational corporations and they don't
want to get in trouble with the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't care that it's legal in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care that the feds say it's not
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is, is that means that
unlike almost any other business,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't go with a business plan to a
bank and get a regular loan, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very concerned with black market
money making its way into the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want you guaranteed to have banked
money to start your legal business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where do you get legal banked money?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bank won't give it to you,
you then have to get it from private
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that have that money in the
bank, which means that the way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize it in this country, all of a
sudden made private investors,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the biggest movers and shakers in
cannabis because they fund all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't, you can't like have,
I mean, imagine there's, there's scenes in
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, in Southern California
where like the license is just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of, of, of licenses they have is
like $800,000 a year to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to be a check cut to the
government, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these, all this infrastructure,
all these build outs, all this different
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that's happening right now that you
see, whenever you see it, it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: always private money that's been raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a business and the taxes
are through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations are crazy and it makes you
do all kinds of inefficient stuff to like
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with the regulations, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Banking is a huge issue and you've got
these private investors that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: told that weed is basically like cocaine
and you're Pablo Escobar and it should be
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling in cash and we want a big return
on our investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you see a bunch of people
starting to grow boof or mids because
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they don't want to, but it's the
only way they can keep their head above
[SPEAKER_00]: water with the taxes, the regulations,
and then the investor group breathing down
[SPEAKER_00]: their neck for return and profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of things that are,
that, you know, that are stacked against
[SPEAKER_00]: mod, like, you know, recreational cannabis
actually getting fire on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That three pounds of light you were joking
about, you know, when Colorado went,
[SPEAKER_00]: went recreational, it was one,
it was one of the first places in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country to go full recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, you know, Washington state and
Colorado, not just medical, but actual
[SPEAKER_00]: like full rec, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these indoors there, the most
important thing was getting three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of light because your accountant or
your CFO or whatever is like, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to get paid?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pay your staff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got to give this enormous chunk
to these investors that helped you build
[SPEAKER_00]: out this huge facility that cost a few
million bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're breathing down our necks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they want is they want you to make
the most money you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not the same thing as the best
weed you can possibly grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean there's not a balance there,
but right now it's been weighted towards
[SPEAKER_00]: survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you've seen it,
but like in California, obviously where I
[SPEAKER_00]: live, there's enormous amounts of licenses
right now that aren't getting renewed
[SPEAKER_00]: because the people have decided it's not
economically viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly because the taxes are too
high and the way they set the rules up are
[SPEAKER_00]: too restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, proposition 64, most people
don't know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was written by a bunch of tech bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know who Sean Parker is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who invented Napster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's one of the guys that,
that he's one of the guys that funded the
[SPEAKER_00]: prop 64 movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they didn't, they didn't,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the best way to put this
is, but it's not like a bunch of lifelong
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts were brought together
and said, Hey, why don't you write out a
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition that would be good for the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bunch of dudes that might've been
very smart and other fields thinking that
[SPEAKER_00]: they could be incredibly smart in this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, you know, they made it,
you know, imagine a bunch of rich tech
[SPEAKER_00]: bros or whatever made it so that like you
needed private capital to exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like they wrote themselves
into the movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you that I, you know,
I don't talk about it all that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, I've done consulting and I
definitely have rubbed shoulders with the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal scenes in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried to help on projects and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very weird culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural difference to get a
lifelong weed person in a room with a rich
[SPEAKER_00]: kid whose parents are worth tens of
millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about a culture clash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about people that don't understand
the other person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you know, look at,
look at, um, you know, uh, Dennis Perrone
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever the first medical in America
happened in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote this law, you know,
he was this gay activist trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to a bunch of his friends who
were suffering from HIV and various other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pushed through this law that was
very vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very much towards the consumer and
very much towards the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sparked a 25, a 20 year,
25, you know, at least 20 year,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 year boom, like nothing anyone had ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these people come inside and they
decide to write this rec thing that was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically benefiting the government,
the rich people, um, not benefiting the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, not benefiting the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're four or five years into it and
it's collapsing under its own weight
[SPEAKER_00]: because no one bothered to talk to the
people that were intimately involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for a long time about how the
structure of it should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it probably will take a whole bunch
of investor money getting lit on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a whole bunch of failure for them to
start adjusting the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't, I don't exactly
know the future is very uncertain because,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a lot of these places are only
surviving off investor money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when investors decide to stop
investing, you get failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's very up in the air and
probably most of the people you talk to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine, because you talk to
people like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't very happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, it's cool in the sense
that yes, America should get used to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that recreational cannabis should be
totally normal, but we really would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to scrap most of the rules around it and
come up with a different, more successful
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some brilliant thoughts there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we will have to wait and watch and
see who does for, you're certainly not
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong about people operating on investor
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a little change of pace though,
I was hoping to ask you last episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm going to get in now before I forget
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to consider the followers of the
show along with myself, maybe a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: bias there just from me, a pretty
passionate bunch of organic fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you've been around the block
long enough to have tried the whole gamut
[SPEAKER_01]: of different grow styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear how are you growing at
the moment in terms of your style and
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs and what's your thoughts on the
whole organic versus synthetic debate?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big enough topic that I actually,
I talked to Matt about doing a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: solo episodes on it, because I think it's
one of the most poorly understood parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also is a little bit like religion
in the sense that people get their belief
[SPEAKER_00]: systems in place on something,
and then they get very, very hard to knock
[SPEAKER_00]: off what they think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think I would say simply,
there is no one size fits all solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is that organic
versus salts, I think is poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think one is superior in all
instances to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll just say that simply,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even just the idea of organic indoor,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you have a backyard garden and
you're growing veggies or weeding it or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, and you're tilling it up and
you're amending it and you're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain amount of native earth,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're adding some stuff to that
maybe, or maybe you're bringing in some
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and you're dumping that on top of the
native earth and you're turning it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing organically outside
according to methods that have been around
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're trying to grow organically
indoor in a two gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you that there is no
soil food web that's complete,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on in a two gallon pot,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times, I don't want to get too
in depth here maybe because I could go off
[SPEAKER_00]: into the weeds on it, but I think that
organic weed is the best possible weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that it's harder to grow
organic weed and there's lots of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that is not as nice as salt grown
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can certainly relate to having now been
to a few bigger facilities, both organic
[SPEAKER_01]: and synthetic that a big thing I,
you know, I'm diehard organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I totally acknowledge that on scale,
you start to see some problems that are
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of inherently addressed in salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's certainly no one size fits
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that people don't
consider, but I've done a decent amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting in the legal scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that is a huge
problem with organics that people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to deal with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, you know, cannabis comes with,
well, there's two parts to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that cannabis comes with testing
where if you have too many heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: it fails testing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cannabis is also a bioaccumulator
of heavy metals, which is a fancy way of
[SPEAKER_00]: saying it absorbs more heavy metals into
its, you know, vascular system than most
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are, you know, you have this
situation where, you know, heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done so much testing on inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really, really hard to find any kind
of input that's derived from the ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: that won't fail heavy metals testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And heavy metals are heavy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a tendency to accumulate and
persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make a bunch of compost and you
compost down your organic matter into this
[SPEAKER_00]: like delicious food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heavy metals don't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They concentrated too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and most compost is made from
commercial agriculture waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could also get sprayed with all
kinds of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the whole organic name is really
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, I don't know if you're
aware of this, but do you know that bone
[SPEAKER_00]: meal and blood meal are organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to come from organic cows
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could get bone meal from the store
that came out of a McDonald's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a massive, you know,
a massive factory with 25,000 cows getting
[SPEAKER_00]: fed antibiotics, all kinds of chems,
all kinds of different stuff, this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they take those bones and grind them
up, it's organic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, you know, blood meal is the,
is the, is the juice that comes off the
[SPEAKER_00]: cows that goes into the sluices when they
do the slaughterhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't have to, that doesn't have to
be from an organic cow, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in, in, in like, in my world,
like sometimes salts might actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner depending on what organic inputs
you might use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the other part of it,
that is really, is really simple is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it as like the plant, the plant
absorbs nutrient salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so when you buy salt, you know,
you know, uh, salt nutrition, that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient salt is in a form that's ready
to, ready to be absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing organically,
those salts are trapped in longer organic
[SPEAKER_00]: chains and bacteria and, and fungi and
different things need to break that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: down to release the salt, to make it
available for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're growing, the plant is
either getting all of the nutrition that
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs, when it needs it, or it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be somewhat simpler to feed it
salts because you can quantify how much
[SPEAKER_00]: food you're giving them or organics you're
hoping that there's enough stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still have skirted the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you grow at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be perfectly honest, I feel like the
best indoor is something that I call
[SPEAKER_00]: Synganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is basically, you know, a mix of
organics and stuff that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily qualify as organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I still think of as really high
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us, give us some ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always keen to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, I, uh, you know,
gosh, this is going to sound, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to sound like I'm avoiding the
question again, but your, how,
[SPEAKER_00]: how I feed would be very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tell me I'm going to be growing in
a one gallon to five gallon pot versus I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to set up a two foot deep by 50 foot
long bed, you know, of, of organic soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: my room versus I'm going to grow in a 50
gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's, there's differences in,
um, in approach, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that don't just meet that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing that's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just throw this in there before
I forget it because we smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's a little different than
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm sure you've heard talk
about how like, you know, you want your
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, your fruits and vegetables to be as
mineral rich as humanly possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want to be able to eat those
vegetables or fruits or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want your body to get that healthy
form of all the nutrition that's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a big worry that like,
you know, um, the levels of nutrition in
[SPEAKER_00]: our food are dropping, which means you're
not getting as much nutrient dense food as
[SPEAKER_00]: you used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's eating things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing, um, you know,
uh, generally speaking, most smokers don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want a plant that's chock full of
nutrition when they're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the whole flush thing comes
into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you want to feed your plant to
where it develops the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, you almost want to
like drain your plant of that nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: before you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not chock full of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another weird thing is that
what you're tricking the plant into doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that it has no interest in
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant does not want to be smoked by
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant wants to soak up as much
nutrition within itself as it possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: can, hold onto that nutrition until it
gets fertilized by pollen, and then use
[SPEAKER_00]: that nutrition to make viable seed so that
its species continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant does not consent to being
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's, it's like, it's,
you know, what we're doing with it is not
[SPEAKER_00]: how it developed over its entire lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even like what you said, there was really
interesting, like that paradigm of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the end of flower and then getting
it to try to drop all of its stored up
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's so the antithesis of what
it's trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have, I have, I have a,
um, we're not friends, we're not friends
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, not because we're not friends,
but just because life pushed us in
[SPEAKER_00]: different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the nicest weed I ever grew
or, or sampled was my buddy had this style
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing in a one in one gallon pots
organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put enough food in there for the
first five or six weeks of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last, you know, he mostly
grew things that were eight to eight to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last two or three or four weeks,
it would just start to slowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: it used up all the food in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it started like using up all the food
within itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you've seen like you know,
or a lot of times when you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: salts and you flush a plant, it just goes
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times when you're growing
organically and you, and the plant starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to run out of nutrition, it's almost like
fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to get all these beautiful
burgundies and all these different color
[SPEAKER_00]: schematics start coming out and he would
starve that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had beautiful white ash,
perfect smoke every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would always say, if I grow in too
big a pots or I grow in beds, how do I,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I flush it when there's so much
nutrition in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, CSI and I talk about
this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're growing for seed
production, you're going to feed the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: vastly different than if you're growing
for smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're growing for seed
production, you're essentially wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: have healthy mothers that have a lot of
nutrition so they can make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: babies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want robust nitrogen, you want excess
nitrogen, you want excess of all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things so that they can suck up
as much food as they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often that smoke, like, like on a
reversal failure, you know, him and I joke
[SPEAKER_00]: that like that smoke isn't nearly as nice
as if you were growing it for smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: because you would feed it differently than
if you're trying to get a bunch of tiger
[SPEAKER_00]: striped robust seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I'm copping out on it,
but it's like, it's such a big subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really hard to do a one size
fits all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you, you think about those people,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, there's people that brag,
Oh, I've got living soil and this is my 26
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your, your, um, your weed is going to have
more nutrition in it because there's no,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no excellent, like the plant
doesn't naturally be like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the human that's growing me is going to
want to smoke this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in five weeks, I should stop uptaking
food and start to starve myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why produce the type of bud that he
prefers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't think of that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I've found with a lot of
my plants, they tend to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like fade and do that senescence thing,
regardless of the food levels I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, kind of, but I bet that you
don't send off your leaves for analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't know how much is in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the other part that's interesting
is that, you know, cause we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to talk about like white ash
crew or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is like such an interesting
debate in the community, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like the fact that, um,
some stuff I've smoked that has black ash
[SPEAKER_01]: is still smoked really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like great high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it is something that, uh, it often has
a lot more to do with how it's dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured than how it's fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people want to, people want to say it
proves how you fed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when feeding it that way can influence
it one way or the other, but it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could feed it organically and starve
the crap out of it and then dry it too
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and not cure it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it won't burn the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's, it's, there's
multiple steps in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I should probably
mention is that a lot of my friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: we find that, uh, um, stuff that's grown
without CO2 to be superior smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause you, you think about,
uh, you know, what does a plant do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing when it's, uh, when it's absorbing
excess CO2, it's sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what does carbon look like when
it's burned black generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you run a high CO2 room and you're
getting bigger yields and you're happy
[SPEAKER_00]: about your weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks all nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more carbon in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, um, then a plant grown without CO2
or with a naturally occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: like atmosphere CO2, because the
atmosphere is 400 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you pump it to 1500 PPM,
it's going to absorb a bunch of that
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon into itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you deal with that at the
end?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, you've got a lot, you know,
it got bigger flowers, you got bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, you're happy, but there's more
carbon in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you fed it carbon and it sucked it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think people think about that
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where in some cases, I almost think
this, this isn't the only reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't hold me to this, but like,
and some reason when people say that they
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer outdoor, I think one of the reasons
why some people prefer outdoor is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not, you can't pump the room full of
four times the ambient CO2 level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they end up preferring the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the only factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun obviously exists and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to say it's just one
thing, but it's definitely a thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess I'll close by saying that
like organic versus salt or indoor versus
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big push in the community to
think the way that I do things is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have trade-offs where.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things in the world have trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gain some things, but you have to deal
with these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the goal to me, when you're growing
weed, obviously is to grow the healthiest
[SPEAKER_00]: plant you can starve it a little bit at
the end, dry it and cure it the right way
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it comes out the type of smoke
that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of different ways to
achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone wants to think, Oh,
I grow organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm better than every salt grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a lot of organic and it's not
always as nice, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've grown organic that I don't
think salt could ever be as good as.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly look a very balanced comment
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can certainly agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting to hear you got
experience on both sides of the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually considering doing some more
salt experiments myself in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I, did I talk about on the previous
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we talk about the experiments I did
with salt and organic side by side?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's touch on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's, let's chat about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you, you brought it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a, there was a time where for
about five years or so I had a section in
[SPEAKER_00]: an indoor, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I would grow the exact same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the same type of lighting,
same condition, same everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one would be the best salt and
additives regimen I could come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other would be the absolute
headiest organic I could think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking like I would buy,
I owned a cement mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mixed all my own soil and inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I went to all my friends and we
like, we would try to come up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: nicest and, and what I would do is I would
grow strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very familiar with three,
four different strains and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would be grown in the same room at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would take it and I would roll
joints and I would sit down with my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and we'd have a sesh and people
would just smoke joints and I would ask
[SPEAKER_00]: their opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often sometimes people preferred the
salt version, which would frustrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: piss out of me because I put so much time
and energy and effort into the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some strains that came out
better organic every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some strains that came out
better, um, you know, salt almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some, you know, that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, you know, you change certain things
and it kind of depended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did these experiments where,
because it's like most people grow one
[SPEAKER_00]: style at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't actually get
side-by-sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like are basing it off memory or other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I grew the same five or six
strains, you know, for a number of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it was like some of my favorite
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would constantly at parties and
stuff, I'd have them labeled AB,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have friends that swore that
they could taste when they smoked salt
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That couldn't pick out which one was the
chem when I gave it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't in a blind taste test,
you know, they could not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there was, so there was certain
things that I found were much harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed organically than salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of that, if you don't feed
the plant, everything that it wants,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it wants it, it's not going to be as
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, do you think that
plays into the idea of like how some
[SPEAKER_01]: people say, well, if the original clone
was like Fino hunted in soil, like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: always going to like that, that was the
ground in which it proved best.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they did the Fino hunting rock,
well, it might not have been as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's much merit to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's like a good plants, good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some merit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that if you're Fino
hunting and you're giving everything one
[SPEAKER_00]: shot, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger Fino hunt, the harder it is to
taste test and actually make a good
[SPEAKER_00]: determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens if you are feeding,
if, you know, what happens if one strain
[SPEAKER_00]: wants more food than another, but you're
feeding it all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so one of them is hungry and
doesn't come out as nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is getting plenty of food
and comes out nicer because it was fed
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the things that makes Fino
hunting hard is, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smaller Fino hunt, the better the
judgment, the bigger Fino hunt,
[SPEAKER_00]: the harder it is to give each plant
individually what it might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're honestly like,
I'll put this in a, in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: context.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have charts, you know, of like the
strains that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the filters that I apply to
them is whether they're a, a light,
[SPEAKER_00]: a medium or a heavy feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've done things like I've done
light depths and stuff in the two 15 era
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm feeding everything the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this plant's hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I up the food and now I'm slightly
burning these other plants because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need that high level of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I realized it was actually kind of
important to group strains that fed the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really important to do that because
if you put something that doesn't need
[SPEAKER_00]: much food, like say a cook key next to
something that wants to eat a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a camera sour, one of them is going
to buy nature, be unhappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of have to like, um,
you know, I, I mean, there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there was times too, like some of
the best herb I ever grew was I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: everything like really light salts and
then everything was inorganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the stuff that needed more food,
I top dressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd that go?
[SPEAKER_00]: It went really, like I said, it's some of
the, you know, it allowed me to
[SPEAKER_00]: individually, you know, individually deal
with different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the light feeders just got light
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heavy feeders, maybe I would top dress
some different organic stuff on them once
[SPEAKER_00]: every week or 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they got watered,
that water would hit that top dress and go
[SPEAKER_00]: down and they would get more food.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have thought you would have done
it the other way, but yeah, that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, because it's like,
it's way easier to, it's way easier to get
[SPEAKER_00]: every everything a light dose and then to
up individual beds or pots or something
[SPEAKER_00]: with the stuff that needs more than it is
to give everything heavy dose because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's already some things that don't
want that much food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and then the other part comes,
it's like, you know, if you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: things and you're doing it, you know,
on a, on a certain level, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens when you've got strains that
are eight weeks and you're growing them
[SPEAKER_00]: off the same reservoirs and stuff that on
plants that need 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: No flush for the plants who want eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need, you know, you, you need some
flexibility in there to be able to give
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual strain what it wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might want to be backing off food on
this strain, because it's done at sick 56
[SPEAKER_00]: days, but this other thing is going to
take 75 and I can't back off at 50 at when
[SPEAKER_00]: I back off the other one, I need to feed
it for a few more weeks before I start to
[SPEAKER_00]: taper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, actually I'll tell you,
I'll tell you a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was consulting on a bigger farm down in
Southern California and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dealing with these big ag guys and
they thought what we were doing was nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what they would do on a farm,
like say a farm of blueberries or
[SPEAKER_00]: something is they would grow one variety
on like 40 acres and they would take leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: samples and they would dial in what that
one varietal needed exactly in nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that like the California
market required us to grow like 80
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, how do you dial that in?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you figure that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you feed the right way?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you give the plants what they
want?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes I'll tell people if they're
trying to grow a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: style, a whole bunch of different plants,
maybe the best way to grow is pots because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can individualize the watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's not even talking about
how fast things drink versus not,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because things don't even have the same
root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be times when like if I grow,
say like sour diesel next to next to OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, I'll have to water the sour diesel
twice as much as I do the Kush or twice as
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have them in the same bed,
one of them is either getting under or
[SPEAKER_00]: over water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figuring out what your plant needs for
water and food and all that different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of stuff, you'll kind of hollow have
to piece it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing like, like behind
you, if you're growing in a little tent or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, like it can be pretty
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing it over, you know,
some licenses or some acreage or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, it can be a real logistical
challenge to figure out what to group
[SPEAKER_00]: together and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like there's a good couple of
episodes in that topic alone ready for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to crank out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like when you told it to me,
I was like, man, I'm going to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ramble just because it's like
so big of a subject, but, um, and in a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutshell, it's paying attention to the
plants you grow and trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what they need when and figuring out,
are they heavy feeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they light feeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need something specific?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do they need, you know,
to do they, you know, all that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff plays into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the more things you grow,
the more complex that becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bigger size you grow, the more
complex that becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got, you know, you got a tent or
you got a little four lighter or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably give a lot of individual
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you start growing in bigger levels and
you really, it makes a big difference
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's like, I've definitely grown
things where certain strains are hungry
[SPEAKER_00]: and certain strains are burning from too
much food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now how do I, like, how do I get it to
grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of value in what you say,
grouping them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure from those big ag guys point
of view, what we do is all very,
[SPEAKER_01]: quite unscientific, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, I actually think I used to get
worried about big ag taking us over,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have decades of a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, big ag is used to being
able to force feed the consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is the most profitable model for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're having a rough go of it because
they're used to like, they're used to the
[SPEAKER_00]: only consideration is like, did I get more
tons an acre or less?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the little things about weed that
lead to good quality smoke, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: consider to be an inefficient mess that we
need to eliminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you grow boof.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the light at the end of the tunnel
for the corporate takeover at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to chat to you about some
chem-dog stuff, but before we go there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to do a little something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never sort of asked this style of
question before, but I think you're the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect person to do it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we recently did an episode with SkungVA
and he made an interesting comment later
[SPEAKER_01]: on in the episode where he basically said
something to the effect of, I don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: engage in the internet detective work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's much value in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, given both you and I have podcasts
that very much engage in the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: detective work, I'm going to state that
upfront that we might have some bias here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would love to hear you both steel
man and straw man this statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what could you say that would sort of
say, yeah, there's that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the other hand, what could you
say that is like, well, like that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: encapsulate the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a loaded question,
but I would say that the reason why we
[SPEAKER_00]: have everything that we have as humans is
curiosity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Curiosity is what is what drives us,
you know, inventions, pushing things
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a, you know, I talked
about earlier on the show okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: how there's a small conjugate of weed
nerds that like, you know, dives into this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff super deep and there's a larger
group of weed growers that just doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a division right there,
you know, in the sense that we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to unearth, you know, we're interested in
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I, we're interested in getting a
lot of this like oral history that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be lost, you know, down on recordings
perhaps or getting different viewpoints
[SPEAKER_00]: before they're lost to time because it's
the world that we're in and most of what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened happened underground and it isn't
written down anywhere and it's all,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be lost, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have this interest in delving
into this curiosity and trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: every little bit we can about the history
of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of people, the history is
sort of not relevant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe, you know, I'm not going to
speak for him or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like maybe he's going to be is like,
well, it doesn't put any more money in my
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it affect, like, how does,
how does like the lineage of chem 91
[SPEAKER_00]: affect me today?
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably doesn't in his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe he's not curious about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with not being
curious about it, you know, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason why, you know, and it's also
interesting too, because if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about weed fame, think about how many
people you've interviewed that you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably interviewed because they got
associated with a famous strain early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why that matters is because
people are interested in the history and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're interested in who knew what early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, if this guy had it early on,
he probably knows more about the real
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, like I said,
there's, um, a lot of people up in Mendo,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be like, give me something that
the buyer wants and I'm going to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on a lot of the Hills up here,
there might only be one or two weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, most people just want to
crop it and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with chem dogs
specifically, I think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he might be right in the sense that after
30 some years, there probably isn't a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of new historical information that's going
to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also people that have gotten
famous on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, they're not interested in the,
they're, they're interested in history in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense of like, well, if it makes me
look good and it makes me money,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, then I'm not into it
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people get touchy about these
debates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, um, and, you know,
I deal with this all the time actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were involved early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not only do they not care,
but they don't want the debate to even
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like, I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't, this is what happened.
Accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but then there's questions
because the way that weed happened is like
[SPEAKER_00]: most of us were like young partiers and
nobody knew that what they were doing was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about, think about a chem
dog for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many 17 year olds popped seeds in
America and never got famous for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them except chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, and you know,
you can talk about the sour diesel thing
[SPEAKER_00]: too, where it's like, there's a bunch of
young kids growing a little bit of weed in
[SPEAKER_00]: their closet or with their friend or
whatever else making these decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody was considering man,
you know, 25 years from now, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: steps, all these choices I'm making are to
be important to a large group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we, let's just cut to the core of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the story that goes around
online, you know, that Greg got 13 seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think that's accurate or do you
think that's accurate to the best of his
[SPEAKER_01]: memory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll start by saying I wasn't there
for any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not about to say that it didn't
happen the way that they described it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what seems to be generally agreed is
that he bought some weed at Deer Creek at
[SPEAKER_00]: a dead show in 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he hit dude up and he bought a
little bit more weed that got sent to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been completely clarified if
all the seeds came out of the first or the
[SPEAKER_00]: second batch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's 100% certain,
but it is generally agreed that he got two
[SPEAKER_00]: different little batches of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to think that the seeds were in the
first batch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to remember that we know who
they came, you know, he bought the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: from Joe Brand and Peabud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is, is that Joe Brand and
Peabud didn't grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hippies buying and selling weed
on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot, and they didn't find out that
anything came of these seeds for probably
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years after they sold the bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes I think about that now
when you say, and I agree in a sense that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very unlikely we'll find out the
lineage of ChemDog now, but there is that
[SPEAKER_01]: little bird in the back of my mind that
says, yeah, but Joby and Peabud didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know about the ChemD for like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he might get mad at me for saying
this, but my understanding at least is
[SPEAKER_00]: that Joby and Peabud sold the weed to
ChemDog and then discovered something came
[SPEAKER_00]: of it on ICMAG in the forums, say like 04,
05, 06 Asherah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was, it's exactly what you
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And JJ was online and he was the one who
linked them back with Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you know, that's kind of why
they call, they used to call like the one
[SPEAKER_00]: through the four, the reunion,
the reunion batch, because it was like the
[SPEAKER_00]: band got back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Peabud and Joby sell this
weed in 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 15, 14, 15 years later,
they hear something came of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Peabud didn't smoke Chem91 until 06.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was definitely a big time
delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not dissing them or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that like, you know,
Dead Tour brings people together from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they weren't from that little
part of, of they were significantly older
[SPEAKER_00]: than Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't from that little part of,
of Massachusetts that Greg was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they lived in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They met up in on summer tour and dude
bought a sack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me, let me cut to the next question
that everyone's going to be wondering
[SPEAKER_01]: then, which is that a lot of people,
and by a lot, I mean a small number have
[SPEAKER_01]: suggested that maybe there was only four
seeds in that first batch of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first iteration of the chems we saw,
which was, you know, the sister and the 91
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they met up later,
other essential breedings had taken place.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That there may have only been just four
seeds or something close to that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, there's no doubt that,
you know, regardless of how many seeds you
[SPEAKER_00]: think there were, they were popped at very
different times, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that probably the only
thing that will put this debate to rest is
[SPEAKER_00]: if we actually get like genetic testing
that works to where like, you can prove if
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are full sisters or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because the thing is, is that,
you know, I've talked to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, I won't say their names or
whatever, but I do think that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that chem dog has gotten a little,
a little gun shy about the story because
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what he says, he gets attacked
and people are like, Oh, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said this thing on IC mag and Oh five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't totally line up with what
you said in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this doesn't get said,
and that doesn't get said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ends up happening is it ends up,
you know, um, it just ends up shutting
[SPEAKER_00]: down the debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the stories that I've told you
basically came from me talking to Staten
[SPEAKER_00]: Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and some of the loudest people in chem
fam online are, you know, aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily people that were there when
all that stuff happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, skunk VA, he didn't get,
he didn't get the, the chem until Staten
[SPEAKER_00]: Island gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, P bud was very important
in the gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he sold the weed, but then he didn't
get it till years late, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: till decades later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, and then you have a
situation where you have Greg where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, he was a 17 year old kid
popping some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe I'm not answering the
question, but I will say very directly
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think that if it's all from the
same 13 seeds, the only way I could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly see that happening is if there
was multiple phenols, which was very
[SPEAKER_00]: common back in 1991, the ounce he bought
wasn't all the same weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mixed weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that who's to say that all the pollen
was the same pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the way that Greg and his
close friends could be absolutely telling
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe the chem D, the chem 91
and the four are full sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I think they're too different,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I've grown them all for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've had a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a lot of seeds with different
ones of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen their progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I personally do not believe do I have
proof that they're not full sisters?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but, um, that doesn't mean I'm calling
Greg a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I just look at how different they
are and look at how different their
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny is when you breed with them and
look at the different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't see, um, them coming from
the same exact mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I certainly agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that I do always think to
myself though, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: often we hear the sort of line of like
certain stories are kept the way they are
[SPEAKER_01]: because names are tied to it, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I also think to myself,
like Greg is a glassblower by trade and I
[SPEAKER_01]: really don't feel like his income is
necessarily tied to the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sort of helps me to feel like I
think what he says probably is the truth
[SPEAKER_01]: to like, I don't see why he would have a
reason to lie per se because he was
[SPEAKER_01]: honest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He killed the male from that first lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're going to be really
analytical about it, that sort of makes
[SPEAKER_01]: him seem like, Oh, you know, that wasn't a
good call.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was being pretty upfront about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that there's like merit to
that sort of line of thinking of well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that like, it doesn't seem like a super
obvious reason to lie about any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also taking into account that
maybe like everyone, his memory is not
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, your memory definitely isn't
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to remember too, that like,
I mean, how do I say this and be polite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, think about back when you were 17,
18, 19, 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you were a hippie who liked to go
to dead tour and smoke weed and do drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're pretty much probably mostly
into partying and chasing girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what was your focus?
[SPEAKER_00]: At 17 to 21, most of us that developed
into weed nerds weren't weed nerds then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we were trying to have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what happened is, is that the
chem D and the chem 91 are two of my all
[SPEAKER_00]: time favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't have them if it wasn't for
Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am very, very grateful to Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: For as a teenager in an illegal state,
taking risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, but I also think to
myself, cause I started growing in 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few years after that, the level of
education, the level of knowledge that
[SPEAKER_00]: existed back then compared to now was
tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few books.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mostly didn't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To just get a bunch of good information.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know stuff that I'm hesitant to say,
um, just because it, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a political element to
some of this stuff, you know, where w
[SPEAKER_00]: what, what if I say that's the truth,
but all of a sudden, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, you know, P butter skunk VA or
somebody else or Greg mad at me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, and, but it's not like
I'm dissing anyone or lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, and it might not be the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a truth because let's face
it, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg has, you know, I won't name them,
but Greg has some close friends that were
[SPEAKER_00]: like around him when he was popping those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't, you know, skunk VA was not,
um, we encountered the, the chem in
[SPEAKER_00]: California because Staten Island brought
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so, um, you know, I mean,
there's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's people that like
everyone would consider chem fam that
[SPEAKER_00]: barely even know each other and didn't
know each other at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it never met back then for long
periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, there's different people
that have different little pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to be real careful, like from
California, because Staten Island told me
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff and I didn't encounter the
chems until the late nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also kind of a long time from
when those first things were popped too.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, Matt posted this thing where
we're trying to do this like lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about like potential,
um, lineage of the chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking, I was, I was talking
about it, uh, you know, where I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've stated before that I think it it's
reasonably likely that it's it's chem
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got, and, and certain people got
heated on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then JJ hits me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, okay, let's say I take
everything you're saying is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does it have to be 91 skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't it be sis skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well crap, JJ,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it could be how we, we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a thing when phylos first
came out, the way they raised all this
[SPEAKER_00]: money from all of us and collected $300
for test kits was because there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: core group of nerds that like wanted
scientific proof that some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and these lineages were true,
prove or disproven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ended up that they couldn't do the
testing specific enough to give us the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers we were craving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day we might be able to get chem four
and chem D and chem 91 and whatnot tested
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetically it might prove some
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then there's just going to be
various people, you know, getting mad at
[SPEAKER_00]: each other on the internet endlessly about
this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, as a breeder and a grower,
and I've had a long-term relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these chems, I honestly think that
there's some different lineage in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I'm not, and that doesn't
mean that it could be as simple as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say that everything that Greg and
his friends are saying is the absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has this little wooden box of seeds
that he's collecting, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got all these different things
labeled and he pops, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the story is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he pops five or six, four,
you know, four or five, six seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, ABCDE, whatever, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the D came out of,
you know, what if, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, you know, what if,
what if he just grabbed from the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it was smudged?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if he honestly believes that it is,
but it's like, he grabbed something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was like a hybrid of, of chem skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, he's not lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at all, he's totally telling the
truth as best as he recollects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just ends up that a few of those
seeds that he popped, weren't from the
[SPEAKER_00]: original 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were from hybrids that got made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't, I, we were talking earlier
on the show about if you grow the Chem D
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Chem 91 side by side, the Chem D
is much more attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much limier green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much frostier, you know, um,
uh, you know, it just looks like a way
[SPEAKER_00]: different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, you know, but if you grew them
side by side and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think these are full sisters to
people and they knew nothing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage or the history or any of the
controversy, they'd probably say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that prove that they aren't full
sisters?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that's what we're doing is
we're taking 30 year old stories from
[SPEAKER_00]: kids, young kids who were partiers and
what did they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do know, I will say this,
and I don't know if this has been publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: said before, but I'll say it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that, um, in, you know,
a few years after a little while after the
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange happened, I know that Staten
Island and Chem Dog had a conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: where Chem Dog told him that the,
um, the skunk had hermed on the chems and
[SPEAKER_00]: he had grown up some of these seeds and
they were unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he liked them better than either of
the other two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was actually Staten's inspiration
for starting the Superdog project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know about reversals back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know how to like make the two
females, you know, make seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had, you know, we had to go,
it was like a much more roundabout way of
[SPEAKER_00]: like how it got started or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, and he, he told, he told Staten
Island that, you know, they were filling
[SPEAKER_00]: their rooms with these hybrids because
they were just so much frostier and danker
[SPEAKER_00]: and smelled amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were running rooms of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now granted, when he told Staten Island
this, he was probably 21 or 22 years old
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was the mid nineties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I've got a ton of questions to ask,
but first, before it leaves my mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a all honor and credit to
Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 17 year old poppin, you know,
the quintessential cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're all super grateful and
we're all just genuinely curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we talk about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that statement a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, without him, I would not have the
Chem D or the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're literally in my all time
favorite list of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow and smoke them often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and my life would be diminished
without both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am incredibly happy that he took the
risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did when he was young and he did all
that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly think too, that it's like,
I don't think this is a negative thing
[SPEAKER_00]: with him at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's like, he got really famous for
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you ask them, you would
probably tell you that his passion is more
[SPEAKER_00]: in glass blowing and other different
things than it is in actual growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like he didn't do important stuff
with it, but I don't think it's like he
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have that burning drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people, you know, and I don't
think there's anything wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like people, people can have a wide
range of hobbies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, truly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to encapsulate, you know,
sort of both our point of views here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like all of this comes from a
place of love for the plant and genuine
[SPEAKER_01]: curiosity, not because we necessarily
doubt you or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to ask you a few times it's
come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep saying Chem 91, the Chem D,
the Chem 91, the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think the Chem 4 isn't always
in the same breath?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever we talk about elite plants,
91 and D, same sentence, everyone accepts
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're rating plants out of a
hundred, they're both within 95 to 100
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, why, what is it about the four
do you think that doesn't quite leave it
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the third one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that it's crazy, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the Chem D and the Chem 91 are
generally regarded as all time greats by a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really difficult in the same
family to just keep adding all time
[SPEAKER_00]: greats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, statistically, even having two
of them come like that is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the four, I think the four has
two things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going for it that make a lot of people
not, not maybe get the full thing out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, is that the best four is usually
taken about 12 plus weeks, 84 ish days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks done before that, but it's really
done around 12 plus weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of growers that won't take
it 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take it 10 weeks, it's not as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that happens to the four
that makes people have an issue with it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it cures to a golden, a little bit of
a light brown at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in weed, when it comes to brokers or
consumers or whatever else, anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes a little golden or a little brown or
a little yellow, that means you messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't accept that some weed does
that, that it oxidizes a little bit that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those colors are associated with old,
bad, burnt, messed up, not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a general rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that ChemD tends to go a
little golden brown after it cures a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: visually, it's a big downer for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get something that's a little off,
you get something that's harvested 10 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 days before it needs to be,
it's not going to be as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I think the four has some
NL5 haze in it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know because it's got these big
long colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stretches like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow the D, it's like a short squat
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a while to get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much done at nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of people that pull it,
but it mostly gets pulled in the early to
[SPEAKER_00]: mid sixties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say some people pull it in the
high fifties maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the four really takes, I mean,
it takes a full 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not very many strains that people
are willing to take 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a chem thing, but the amount of
people that would pull sour around here,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days, 14 days early, because it had the
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was good enough to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers don't like going over
eight, nine weeks, 10 weeks on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting into 11, 12,
13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to grow weed that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's, I think most people
don't take the four long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that it's got a little
bit more of that like zippy sativa high in
[SPEAKER_00]: like you smoke enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you like a little race
iness in your chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very different buzz than how
the chem D and how the dog hits you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should say this just before I
forget, but, uh, did anyone ever tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason why we all call it the dog?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it makes you roll on the ground like
a dog or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, because when Staten Island brought
it West, he was a hundred percent fully
[SPEAKER_00]: organic grower and he didn't want to call
any weed that he grew chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he shortened it to the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dog, you know, he's your, your organic
chem dog, you know, it's chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a nickname, uh, the four or five
of us or whatever who had it out here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you that like me, I see
collective Staten Island, skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard any, like in the,
in, in that era, the late nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: early two thousands before the forums or
whatever, we all just called it dog or the
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, we never called it chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, I knew obviously that that's
what like its full name, but that was our
[SPEAKER_00]: nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, from 91, the skunk VA cut
all those different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all forum names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all names that came up as a way
to identify it when people were typing out
[SPEAKER_00]: sentences online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I've started using them,
um, just because it's it, how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate, you know, communication wise
it's, but it took me a long time because
[SPEAKER_00]: the first, I mean, we just called it
straight dog for forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you have it gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: As always massive shout out to not so dogs
for coming on for this epic third in
