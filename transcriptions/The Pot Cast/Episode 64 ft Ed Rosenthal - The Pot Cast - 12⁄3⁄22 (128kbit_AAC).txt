[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, and welcome back to another episode
of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on today's episode, we are joined by
one of the biggest names in the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: a true pioneer who wrote the Marijuana
Grow Guide back in the late 70s with Mel
[SPEAKER_04]: Frank, someone with a plethora of
publications since then, including the big
[SPEAKER_04]: Book of Buds series, Beyond Buds,
Ask Ed, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_04]: A huge welcome to the guru of ganja,
Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first question I love to ask our
guests these days, what have you been
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking some G4 and then a
proprietary variety of a friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: J27.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very socializing and upbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And G4 tends to be that way as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say that in general,
you prefer more sort of uplifting
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties over the relaxing ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, uplifting and relaxing are
not mutually exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something can be uplifting and not make
you nervous or paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the kinds of uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, everything depends upon
mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's evening, you probably wouldn't
want to smoke something that's too upbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something a little more relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of wonderful
indicators that have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the interesting things about what
you just mentioned about your friend's
[SPEAKER_04]: proprietary blend is it got me thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read on your website recently,
you wrote a nice article about paradise
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that stood out to me
was SensiStar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was such an amazing commercial hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was one of those strains where they
never released the genetics behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got me wondering, do you think that
we're going to see more things like what
[SPEAKER_04]: your friends done where there's sort of
proprietary genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a way of solving that
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are these firms that do genetic
mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could send in a sample and they
could play where it is on this genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low paradise hasn't released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody could send in a sample of it and
then see where it is on the genetic map.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The technology today is fantastic in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess more from like the commercial
success point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that that sort of thing would
fly or do you think growers are so like
[SPEAKER_04]: pedantic about what am I growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know the lineage or do you think
like it could work commercially?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it all depends where you are
in either the industry or the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you really have to know the
progenitors if you have a high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it really matter to most people?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly a good quality bud is a
range supreme, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what else about good quality
buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more popular than any politician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever there's an initiative in the
United States for marijuana and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: the politicians 58, 46 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in Oklahoma, the most
conservative state, medical won by 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why politicians hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good way of viewing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't thought about like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted you to take me back if
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I met cannabis within a very
short time, I knew it was going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great friend and ally and that it would be
a long term relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's lasted any of my romantic
relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good way to view it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: True friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when was it that you decided you wanted
to dedicate yourself and your life to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis law reform and to just cannabis
in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a specific incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hitchhiking from Florida to my home
in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had in my suitcase, a bamboo pipe
that somebody gave me and we smoked out of
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while hitchhiking, I was picked up by
the police and they searched the suitcase
[SPEAKER_00]: and they charged me with possession and
all kinds of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went to trial and the judge said to
the cop, I don't ever want to see a case
[SPEAKER_00]: like this in this courtroom ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really wise judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was before the drug war really
was hitting its hardest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I was leaving the courtroom with
my mother and my aunt on either side of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sergeant who arrested me and who
testified against me, Sergeant Edwards of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowling Green, Virginia, marijuana people
have a lot to thank him for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he came and stood in the way of our
path and put out his hand to shake hands
[SPEAKER_00]: with me or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to him, get out of my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my aunt who's very polite person said,
Eddie, you shouldn't talk to the officer
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, but Anna Elsie, he tried to
put me in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, she looked at the cop and
she said, officer, could you please remove
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself from that path?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The making of an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I was active in it before,
but not the way that that caught me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really felt that cannabis was an
ally from the very first time that I used
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he confirmed what I should be doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I love that sentiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we all have a lot to thank that
officer for getting the the stone rolling
[SPEAKER_04]: on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did you progress from that point up
until you first started to learn about
[SPEAKER_04]: growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you sort of thought to myself,
God, I've got to write about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had always been interested in
horticulture and had taken classes in it
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was not I was familiar with plants
and growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis was just another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, it is because it's a green
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it observes the same natural laws that
other green plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so I had a spare bedroom in my
apartment, and I decided to convert that
[SPEAKER_00]: spare bedroom into a grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wanted to make little grow
tents for people to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got some publicity from a newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: No longer was in existence for a long time
called village village voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time, they had an
article about how to grow by this other
[SPEAKER_00]: well, they well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they gave me a lot of publicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got some publicity and Rolling
Stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, they had an article
on how to grow by another fellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they asked if we would like to meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he, you know, we both decided to
meet each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we decided to write a book about
how to grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that book was a great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that book came out, you know,
if you're six, if you enjoy doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something and you're successful at it,
you tend to stay doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I really like being around the
plant and being in the whole every part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that meal you were around the plant,
including and cultivation is a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, what a meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: A meeting of the minds, you know,
yourself and Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the questions that was really
itching my brain when I was thinking about
[SPEAKER_04]: our chat today was when you were writing
this book, did you have any sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: inkling that it was going to cause this
mammoth, you know, change in the scene and
[SPEAKER_04]: inspire millions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did it just seem like, you know,
sort of the average book?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, people's goals change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I assured my author that we would be
able to make about two hundred dollars a
[SPEAKER_00]: week each, which at that time was a lower
middle class salary or something from
[SPEAKER_00]: writing that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And little did I realize that it would be
much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first book, Indoor
Outdoor Marijuana Growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a it was a thin book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wrote the thicker book,
The Marijuana Growers Guide that people
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that book was that book was a
huge success because it was more
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific than any of the books and had
more substance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I stayed on that path.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of curiosity, back, you know,
when you were first writing it,
[SPEAKER_04]: what sort of strains were you growing back
then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they have names?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where we were in New York City,
it was all either Colombian or Mexican or
[SPEAKER_00]: Panamanian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all these imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first plants that I grew were from
seeds in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were imported marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the West Coast, there was more of a
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we became acquainted with it when both
of us moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank and I both moved to first
Berkeley, then Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a different milieu where
there was already breeding going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the skunk man
[SPEAKER_00]: the fellow who invented skunk number one
and some other varieties, he was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds like you were in the
hotspot when you got to California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be interested to quickly ask you,
did you have any personal interactions
[SPEAKER_04]: with Sam the Skunk Man?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a very mysterious figure in the
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both Mel and I were good friends with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he moved to Holland,
we saw each other quite a bit when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen him much in recent years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I think he has been a little
more active in the past than he is
[SPEAKER_04]: recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if we fast forward a little bit,
your newest book has just been released,
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cannabis Grower's Handbook,
which our listeners can purchase from your
[SPEAKER_04]: website, edrosenthal.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, huge congratulations on
the new book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, what sort of topics does the
book go into?
[SPEAKER_04]: What can people expect to be able to read
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it follows the template of the last
book, The Marijuana Grower's Handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it covers things in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, it covers light in terms of
the radiance of the light, how intense it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, in more scientific terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before, for instance, indoors,
we would say 60 watts or 600 watts or so
[SPEAKER_00]: many watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of using an input measurement
for instance, we use the actual light
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything about the book has
been upgraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot on different ways of
growing sustainability, changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it was updated, it was
totally rewritten.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major difference now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what a fantastic answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to actually ask you that
question, you know, what was the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference between The Cannabis Grower's
Handbook and The Marijuana Grower's
[SPEAKER_04]: Handbook.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there you go, you answered it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: A perfect segue into the next question is
that, you know, many technologies have
[SPEAKER_04]: evolved over the time since your first
book was published in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in recent years, most notably,
the lighting technology has really come a
[SPEAKER_04]: long way with the advent of LEDs and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your preferred lighting source at
the moment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you prefer outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, I'm helping some people in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the companies there are using
greenhouses all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that that's as useful as
mostly growing outdoors in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you're up in Canada,
in order to extend the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to grow in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, I know people who grow
outdoors in the Arctic, and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: about 95 days of favorable weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow within that period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to start indoors and put plants
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they still do, but now they're
using auto flowers, which makes their life
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: One has to look at what the situation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you have space outdoors,
whether you have greenhouse space,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor space, but whatever, you know,
growing is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, I've mentioned this
before, and it's in the last book,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this book, that it is a warning that
using marijuana may not be habit-forming,
[SPEAKER_00]: but growing it's addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anybody who just puts that seed in
the ground soon enough, they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: addicted and they'll always have a plant
in their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can certainly vouch for that on a
personal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very addicting indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And heck, one of our other guests said
cannabis is a gateway to just gardening in
[SPEAKER_04]: general.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've met a number of people who,
they started with cannabis, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: before you know it, they were working in
one agricultural area or another,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what marijuana is a gateway
drug to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't heard that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, in New York City,
you know, where they have, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the United States is this big
opioid problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in New York City, they said that if
you have a prescription for opiates,
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of opiate, you can use it to go
to a marijuana dispenser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know how they used to say marijuana
leads to these hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what they're saying now is if you
have hard drugs, how about trying pot?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the weirdest thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that all along, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that everybody had known people
who had serious drug problems who solved
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the medical professionals just
couldn't tolerate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, give them some other pill that's
addictive instead, you know, their policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, that's not addictive, but you
better take it every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's quite shocking when you read
about some of the early you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: pharma reports about the, you know,
opioids like Percocet and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, oh, it's just,
it's not addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, the people who perpetrated
that their corporations are coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements to pay back a lot of the,
some of the money that they, I feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: they stole from the American people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that the people who
perpetrated it, they're handling it
[SPEAKER_00]: corporately and they should be handling it
as a criminal matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people knew that a certain
percentage of their victims would die from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should be charged with some sort
of homicide or murder charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what, any district attorney
in the United States could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not bound to any agreements that
the government made.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could just charge any of these people
criminally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, I mean, if you put like,
in both Australia and the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's serious criminal penalties for
murder, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But is it not for executives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to get out of free town?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they should.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was thinking to myself, even if they
pay adequate compensation, whatever that
[SPEAKER_04]: is, who knows that there's still yet this,
this pandemic of people addicted to
[SPEAKER_04]: opioids and like, how do you clean that
up?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess while we're on the topic of
sort of drugs and the effect on society,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be interested in hearing your opinion
on, it seems as though federal
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization of cannabis in the United
States is becoming a possibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there's been some back and
forth from Biden as to whether he wants to
[SPEAKER_04]: do it, but I guess in general,
you could say it looks like we're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: closer to the war on drugs, at least for
cannabis ending.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see that in the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think it's still too hard to
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, you know, in the year 2000,
the, the, the democratic president,
[SPEAKER_00]: the presidential candidate who used pot,
we're familiar with pot, went to Grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead concerts with his wife, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Said that marijuana had no medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course he lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Hillary Clinton refused to
endorse cannabis on any level,
[SPEAKER_00]: like saying, well, maybe we should
investigate medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, she won, lost by a few
votes, supposedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would have, she would have won if she
had just said we should, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should legalize medical use federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no reason to believe that the
Democrats won't shoot themselves in the
[SPEAKER_00]: foot again, by refusing to, to go positive
on the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they have on a local level,
but not on a national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it seems to me everybody's
predicting tremendous losses for Biden and
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way out of it is marijuana
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It solved so many people's problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could sell the problems of the
democratic party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully we can see that happen in
the coming years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to loop back for a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few questions ago, you were talking
about, you know, people in the Arctic with
[SPEAKER_04]: limited timeframes for growing and just in
general, you know, people in sort of more
[SPEAKER_04]: specific grow environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had guests in the past talk about
how autoflowers might be a good solution
[SPEAKER_04]: to some of these interesting climates that
have short windows of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: favorable weather and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you, what's your thoughts on autos in
general?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think we're going to see them
increasingly become more popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they, when I was talking about the
Arctic, that's what people were using,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if they didn't use autoflowers,
they would have had, they were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: some acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they weren't using autoflowers,
they would have had to do light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation and that would have been
arduous and costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I've never smoked an
autoflower that I knew was an autoflower
[SPEAKER_00]: that I thought was a super duper high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that they would be very good
for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, something or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could have something that's okay,
that I could concentrate, or I could have
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard one there.
Shh.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting you raised that
question, because one of the, it's sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: not related to autos, but that underlying
principle is at play.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in Australia where being given this
medical system, which for a long time was
[SPEAKER_04]: very restrictive and non-functional at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically the idea is you're never
going to be able to grow at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just not going to allow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can buy like sort of mid-tier
products from one of the registered
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not a dispensary, they're just
producers and you get the bud from the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question sort of becomes,
do you see that right to grow yourself in
[SPEAKER_04]: order to get access to the mid-tier
government stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you hold out and sort of grow your
own and be like, no, I'm not making that
[SPEAKER_04]: compromise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I want to be able to grow at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where would you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there hadn't been home growers
violating the law in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: the law would never have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that people in Australia should
take a hint from Limbon and overgrow the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as the government tries to stamp
out, you know, and NSW, although they try
[SPEAKER_00]: to stamp it out and they have those
campaigns and everything, but they seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: supply Sydney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's the equivalent of
Humboldt here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's the thing, but it becomes
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people in Limbon will be sadly
disappointed because that's not really an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural area and it's very tropical
and has very high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the ideal place to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that what's happened in the
United States is more of it's growing when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being grown outdoors, it's being
grown on agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a fellow in Limbon who took me up to
his garden that was in one of the national
[SPEAKER_00]: parks in NSW.
[SPEAKER_00]: His route was exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just totally exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd have 10 plants here and 20 plants
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he figured that even if the government
saw the plants, they weren't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grapple down from the helicopter to get
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that totally changes with legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one negative thing about legalization
is this, as it is now, to a great extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the money stays within the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're part of that community of consumers
and small time dealers, and growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have more commonality than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have cultural commonalities
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's happened in the United States
and Canada is that it's become legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have become billionaires from this,
a number of billionaires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously the money is flowing out of
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a larger community,
so you're getting more middle-class people
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still there's money flowing out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That money isn't circulating as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a negative sign of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody asked me, well,
how do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So creative solutions there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, on the topic of legalization,
since recreational laws have passed in the
[SPEAKER_04]: States, we see a wide diversity and volume
of clones being swapped and traded,
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly more so than back in the Prop 62
days or 64 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our Canadian guests who was on the
show recently, Kevin Cullum, he commented
[SPEAKER_04]: on how, since there's all this trading of
clones and genetics, he's certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: noticed an increase in the emergence of
the cannabis-specific aphid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I'm sort of wondering,
from your point of view, do you think that
[SPEAKER_04]: growers need to be quite mindful of the
fact that with this increase in volume of
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic material being traded,
we could very well inadvertently generate
[SPEAKER_04]: more cannabis-specific pests and things
that are more resilient to the more milder
[SPEAKER_04]: forms of pest treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the new races of powdery mildew,
are much more dangerous than older races
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that either cannabis-specific
or may have evolved on, I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred from hops to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now they've gotten more virulent
and you have the rush at night and that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's specific to cannabis,
but it really, treats on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that always happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, when you're dealing with the
plant issue of cannabis, it's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: any other plant and follows the same
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to end, same thing in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to stop the spread of these
diseases and pests.
Parasites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you just touched on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, things coming from hops,
the hop latent virus is like a very,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, popular sort of buzzword in the
community at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I read an article that said it has
knocked off like up to a billion dollars
[SPEAKER_04]: off the USA market value over the past few
years, just due to like plants
[SPEAKER_04]: underperforming from it and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think we overcome what is sort
of comparable to like the COVID of plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you think there's a risk it could
ramp up to pandemic proportions where like
[SPEAKER_04]: just all plants have it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think it's probably not that
serious?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could become serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know that much about it,
about that particular viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to develop plants with a
resistance to virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much harder than let's say to fungus or
certain bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also depends how effective it is at
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although people, outdoors, I know that a
number of farms have really suffered from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the solution is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't, you know, it's not like a
fungus where you can say, oh, spray this
[SPEAKER_00]: or do this or practice a different
cultural technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather as we know that, you know,
you can be living a clean, healthy life
[SPEAKER_00]: and still get a virus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are people that I know
who said, oh, I'm, you know, taking good
[SPEAKER_00]: care of myself and avoiding any way of
getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was in ICU for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he, up until the point where he got
it, he was sure that he would be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: resist it because of his healthful
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think viruses respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In humans or in plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly some wise words to heed
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if we just talk about general
pests and pathogens, I see in all the grow
[SPEAKER_04]: stores I go to your zero tolerance
product, which is, you know, really good
[SPEAKER_04]: general strategy for pest management.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering what are some of the general
strategies you advocate for growers to
[SPEAKER_04]: help keep just general bugs at bay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's, you know, it's isolation
strategies, especially indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in indoors and greenhouses,
once an insect or a disease gets in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't the natural resistance that
nature provides in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the main main thing I would do is
the prevention method, which is isolating
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing area and the cultural area
from the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's done through the, you know,
there are a lot of things, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: change of clothing, hand nets,
beard nets, having people in actually in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a garden technique,
which requires constant care by humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might consider getting a different
technique because there's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility when something occurs that
it's occurred because of it was carried in
[SPEAKER_00]: by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, of course,
isolation of isolation of any new plants
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in, you know, if you're importing
plants, also preventive spraying,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you get to the point of when I say
spraying, I'm not necessarily talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about pesticides as much as with
beneficial bacteria and beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then doing inspections all the time,
isolating any plants that seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: diseased, getting rid of any plants that
aren't performing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, you know, every once in a while
you get a plant that is ready to thrive,
[SPEAKER_00]: remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait to see how it does in three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got a bit of a tough question
that I give to all our guests because I
[SPEAKER_04]: think the answer is we're still looking
for an answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if someone came to you and said,
hey, look, I'm in week five of flower and
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just noticed a pest infestation.
[SPEAKER_04]: What sort of strategies do you think
people can use in those situations?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you feel like it's a bit too far and
anything you do is going to be pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: detrimental to the crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends what the pest is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really depends what the pest
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is it depends how
widespread the pest is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: within how big a population it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might just remove a few plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in a very specific area,
you might remove a few plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you might be able to use some sort of
bacterial or fungal spray against the
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't advise on bringing in
beneficial insects or other creatures like
[SPEAKER_00]: that because they usually take too long to
develop a population where they can handle
[SPEAKER_00]: the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would go with also washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's say you were week six or
something, you may be able to and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: a population you might be able to wash the
population off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it's not going to
eliminate it, but it's going to bring down
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really, really great words there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something which I've always said to
people myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people always buy predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, before you release,
I'm like, just try to get a damp cloth and
[SPEAKER_04]: like wipe off the majority of the bugs you
can see, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's only going to help.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess, yeah, not as commonly known
as maybe we might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, especially outdoors, you know,
if it's a sunny day outdoors, and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, you know, the best thing that,
you know, you're not going, if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower population to control, it's easier
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing to do is to get as much
as many of them off as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, get rid of, you know,
and also I didn't mention herbal sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: like zero tolerance, but herbal sprays are
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't knock down the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing eliminates it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to eliminate your
problem, that problem, but you are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it under extreme control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of greenhouses that are open,
you know, they're constantly getting
[SPEAKER_00]: reinfested from outside, especially in mid
summer, mid and late summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people might take preventative action.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: people I know use take zero tolerance and
dilute it down and fog it into their
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses a couple of times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also repels it, and any herbal
spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some great advice there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we change topics, for a moment,
I really enjoyed reading your Beyond Buds
[SPEAKER_04]: book a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time, I remember thinking this is
really sort of groundbreaking because
[SPEAKER_04]: there really isn't another mainstream book
for growers to learn more about
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrates and like the very finest
specific points you touch on, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: producing and consuming them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got me wondering overall, are you more
of a flower guy or a concentrate guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, gee, I love cannabis so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like low quality concentrates
nor buds, but the high quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: the high end.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a follow up, we've seen a lot of
rise of the common consumer, i.e.
[SPEAKER_04]: people who don't live and breathe
cannabis, but maybe just enjoy it every
[SPEAKER_04]: once in a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a really big uptake of this
sort of consumer, especially around the
[SPEAKER_04]: use of like vape pens, really easily
accessible devices like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has me thinking, where do you see
the future of cannabis consumption going
[SPEAKER_04]: across the whole population?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we're going to see more
concentrate style ingestion or flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: will always be supreme?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it will float back and forth
with different, both with different
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies and just trends, you know,
but people always like novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there hasn't been much action
with, but at some point people will go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, everything in life is retro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just talking about buds,
I'm talking about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything repeats with a little bit of
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, isn't that the truth?
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of our viewer submitted questions
was they wanted to know, do you still
[SPEAKER_04]: combust cannabis these days?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people, as they get a bit
older, they move away from combustion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at that right on cue.
[SPEAKER_04]: He hits a hammer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would people do that when they can
take going there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would people, you know, burn cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't understand how people would
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, it was like you were ready for that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hit it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So likewise, if you check out edrosenthal
.com, you can see there's a really
[SPEAKER_04]: touching tribute to Frenchy Canole,
who sadly passed away not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really got the brain juices flowing
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was thinking, is this the last true
hash pioneer we're going to see?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of people talk about the
fine hash market becoming harder and
[SPEAKER_04]: harder to find good quality products in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Frenchy might have been the
last of the true hash pioneers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that the market will
determine what products are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, it's not theoretical when
people are at the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a conscious decision about what
they'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, as with any consumer
product, the trends go one way,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they go the other way, and they go
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that they'll be a market,
there'll always be a market for kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there's a market, there'll always
be somebody there who is willing to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that he did lead the way in
many areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left a lot of videos, and he did leave
an appreciation in people for fine quality
[SPEAKER_00]: hashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, while we're on the topic of
the market, one of the common discussions
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having with a lot of smaller growers
at the moment is how they feel like with
[SPEAKER_04]: the opening up of new markets,
like say Oklahoma, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as just the existing markets
growing, really feels to them like there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a bit of a race to the bottom in regards
to pricing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them are getting quite
concerned about how they will continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: make a livelihood from this if prices
continue to go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any advice for people who
might feel like they're in that position?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to take it in another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really good that prices are
down for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and frankly, I'm more interested
in the consumer than big corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as prices being down,
well, you know, the only reason prices
[SPEAKER_00]: were up was because of the risk factor
dealing with the legality of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers who were growing it were making
an economic profit from that risk factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that risk factor, you know,
that was like a price support system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, let's say, you know,
in Australia, the government said it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to firebomb one wheat farm,
one wheat farm in all of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the farmers would get out of wheat,
wouldn't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat prices would go up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who was still in wheat would be
doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, marijuana farmers had that for 40
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were being, one way or another,
they were being paid for the risk they
[SPEAKER_00]: were taking, not just for their farming
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we hear any songs about how
wonderful it is to be a farmer or are they
[SPEAKER_00]: all immense?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the farmers go, well,
when you have a good crop, the prices are
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the crop is bad, the prices are
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why do you think the prices are up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because, you know, because of the
shortage of supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody said marijuana farming has to be
profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, what I'd like to see is some
of the big corporations doing the farming
[SPEAKER_00]: to see whether they really have the metal
to do it, whether the people that they
[SPEAKER_00]: hire really have the ability to grow
quality product enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a free market like that,
I think that a lot of the big corporations
[SPEAKER_00]: will be left behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully with that scale,
you know, they can sort of bring the price
[SPEAKER_04]: point down and make it accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess as a sort of general question,
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_04]: whether you felt the change from the old
medical system to the new recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: system in California has been an overall
net positive, or do you feel like there's
[SPEAKER_04]: been pros and cons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the big net positive is fewer people
in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by any measure, any way that you want
to measure it, that's a net positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to make it net positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be a better system?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the other part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half the pot being sold in California,
it's estimated, or more than half of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not coming from registered farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why prices have gone down so
much in California is this, that for
[SPEAKER_00]: instance, you know, Mendocino and Humboldt
marijuana, it's outdoor marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's grown in an area where the
weather is not really agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: weather, not in the way that you really
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoor and greenhouse marijuana is
considered by most Californians to prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the Humboldt material traveled
east.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Humboldt got such a good
reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in New York would say to
Californians, oh, look, I have some
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful Humboldt weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a Californian would look at
it and say, well, why don't you try some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this instead?
[SPEAKER_00]: And because, and so the Humboldt,
it was like export quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it couldn't be sold in California,
so we have to export it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, all of that weed, you know,
now that New York is legal, and
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts and, you know, all of these
states were formerly illegal, where it
[SPEAKER_00]: was, the California pot was filling,
filling the supply side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now, people can grow their own and,
you know, corporations and farmers are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not as much market for the
Humboldt weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why those Humboldt and
Mendocino weed, that's why those prices
[SPEAKER_00]: have fallen precipitously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a problem, but,
you know, nobody said that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, farming, for most farmers who are
not farming cannabis, sometimes it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty rough road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with legalization and the
normalization of cannabis, I can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: because, like, prices are falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no control over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the market, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think sometimes people are quick to lose
sight of the fact that, yeah, the
[SPEAKER_04]: trade-off is less people in jail,
and that is undeniable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably a net positive.
[SPEAKER_04]: No questions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more people get to use it because not
everybody knows somebody who can give them
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it's really good for medical
users because they might want something
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even, well, even if you grow your own
tomatoes, you might buy some tomatoes once
[SPEAKER_00]: in a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Very few people are entirely
self-sufficient, even with the crops they
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sort of an extension of this topic
is the generalization, or maybe you could
[SPEAKER_04]: even call it gentrification, of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a persistent topic that comes up on
our show, the idea of how the industry is
[SPEAKER_04]: being morphed to cater more to the casual
enthusiast as opposed to in the past where
[SPEAKER_04]: you could maybe argue it was more for the
growers and the hardcore enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess this is most evident by going
to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see there's a lot of sort of mid to
low tier brands, not as many high tier
[SPEAKER_04]: brands anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even some of the events like the
Emerald Cup, which are sort of shifting to
[SPEAKER_04]: be more of like a half music festival,
half cannabis festival, and not just about
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders selling seeds, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel this shift yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have any thoughts on how this
might play out long-term for the hardcore
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that that community is
served by independent dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that that product isn't out
and it isn't that people who want it
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that the dispensaries and shops are
catering more to people who don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: connections and who are casual users.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hardcore, the chronic users,
they're usually going to independent
[SPEAKER_00]: dealers because they're buying because the
product is so much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make much difference if you're
only buying a few grams every month or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're using 10 grams a day,
then price does matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, another related topic that gets
brought up in these same conversations is
[SPEAKER_04]: how the market is more largely becoming
dictated by the cannabinoid percentage
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers, especially the idea that a larger
number is synonymous with better quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we need to move away from
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how might we try to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in California, most dispensaries,
though they're not required to,
[SPEAKER_00]: list the terpening percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's become a major factor,
both the cannabinoids, white cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: are in there and the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are looking at it more
holistically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll touch on terpenes in just a
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had one final question around that,
which was, do you think that the labs are
[SPEAKER_04]: being honest when they give their testing
results?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're starting to see results that
are, you know, really high 30s,
[SPEAKER_04]: low 40% cannabinoids for like a flower
sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes me wonder, like there's this
huge variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we just need to get a standardized
testing model or are some of the labs
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe not quite being as truthful as we
might hope?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's been, I think among
the people that I know who do testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they want to produce accurate
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think more standardization is
required.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So recently we've seen the reemergence of
some really old school genetics coming
[SPEAKER_04]: really to the forefront of a lot of modern
breeders palettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking to work with things like
the NL5 haze with the skunk, even the pure
[SPEAKER_04]: haze, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think these varieties are really as
good as the current ones or maybe a bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: rose shaded glass?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too complex a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like it would be,
but answering it gets really sticky,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, because there's one thing
that I'll mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, you would sometimes,
there'd be a bag of cannabis that was so
[SPEAKER_00]: fragrant, it would smell up the room and
you'd remove the cannabis from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd open up the windows and that odor
was still there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't experienced anything like that
in more than 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That may be a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you speak with older cannabis and you
ask them if they've ever had that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and they'll tell you that and,
you know, before the turn of the century,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had that experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: That experience you mentioned,
we hear other people talk of similar
[SPEAKER_04]: events specifically often related to the
roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever smelled what you think is
the roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are a lot of variations on it,
but yeah, where it's actually skunky,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, something more that people from
the Americas would be familiar with in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australians or people in Europe,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the skunks come visit my garden
at night every night.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my marijuana garden, but just where I
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunks, opossums, that's more like some of
the animals that you have from the
[SPEAKER_00]: opossum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And raccoons, you don't have raccoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made their peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're living in cities now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're smart, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_04]: They've adapted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on the topic of turf,
terpenes, you know, as you alluded to a
[SPEAKER_04]: little earlier, terpenes are becoming a
more focal part of what people are looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for in high quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, from my point of view,
it still feels like there's a fairly large
[SPEAKER_04]: ambiguity around the language we use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I might call it sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might call it floral.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we need to try to get some
sort of standardization and if so,
[SPEAKER_04]: would it be of any benefit to customers or
not really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think better than that would be an
actual test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people wouldn't have to rely on their
nose for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, in dispensaries and stores
in the US now, I mean, in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: they list the terpenes in percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are becoming more familiar with
the effects of different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So presenting that information is useful
to the knowledgeable consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one might be a little bit left of
field to answer, but I've had discussions
[SPEAKER_04]: with people in the past and we're trying
to figure out what is it that makes a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain strain feel the way it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our past guests said, you know,
I've got an Afghani that's 20% THC and a
[SPEAKER_04]: Thai that's 20% THC and they largely smell
the same, both sort of mango smelling,
[SPEAKER_04]: but obviously one feels like a very
sedating sort of feel, one feels very
[SPEAKER_04]: uplifting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it begs the question, you know,
what is it ultimately in your mind that
[SPEAKER_04]: makes us feel like a cannabis is a thin
leaf variety or a broad leaf variety?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any thoughts on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like, you know, your friends
who have those two varieties that smell
[SPEAKER_00]: the same, so the chemistry producing the
mango odor was probably masking other
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes that cause the different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I say the only way to
really know what's in it is to test it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, while we're on the topic,
I feel like the Instagram platform itself
[SPEAKER_04]: has done huge, huge work in terms of
getting cannabis out to the consumers,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like a lot of people realize
there's really good quality, but out there
[SPEAKER_04]: just from seeing it on Instagram and being
like, oh, that's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trade off though, is that on Instagram
things can look really good, but you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: smell them or smoke them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can really only go off the visuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people criticize this and say,
you know, it's caused things to shift to
[SPEAKER_04]: things that look good, but maybe don't
necessarily have the terpenes to back it
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you noticed anything like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not really in the buyer mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't get as affected by things like
that, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might not be the right person to
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, understandable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably been a long time since
you've had to purchase some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I purchased some in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a friend, we were temporarily out
and we went into a greenhouse coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent about, I don't know,
$50 and we got this little bag and the two
[SPEAKER_00]: of us started laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $50?
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Times are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: My final question sort of related to
Instagram is that in the past two years or
[SPEAKER_04]: so, we've really seen a big clamping down
of Instagram on cannabis related
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses, sometimes even banning their
accounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it feels as though the platform itself
of Instagram is quite vital to a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like it would be hard to exist
without it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question is, how do we navigate this
space given we're so heavily dependent on
[SPEAKER_04]: it, but they're also not necessarily
looking to play ball with us as an
[SPEAKER_04]: industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Amazon said that they're not testing
their employees for pot anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe the people under the
Department of Transportation, maybe truck
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers or something, but in general,
they're not going to test their workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So isn't that one step away from saying
Amazon is going to deliver?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Amazon does that, then what's
Instagram going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're all going to fall in
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those companies have had, you know
that they earn a good part of their living
[SPEAKER_00]: either off of drugs or porn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, they're so straight-laced about
especially about drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if they had given a little more
support to legalization, we'd be much
[SPEAKER_00]: further ahead than we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a shame that they,
you know, it's natural that they should
[SPEAKER_00]: join to help make it legal all over,
but they haven't been doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as there's a body to be made,
they want to get in on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as legalization rolls out worldwide
over the coming years, do you think that
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll see more institutes like the Oakster
Dam University sort of pop up around the
[SPEAKER_04]: world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there are a few other
universities like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know where others are,
but there might be one in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, colleges and universities are
opening up degrees in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UC Davis, which is perhaps the best
agricultural school in the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: UC Davis has a curriculum in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to happen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now here's what is we hope that
they use this particular book as a
[SPEAKER_00]: textbook, cannabis growers handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shipping it out to people who
pre-order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you could go wrong if that's
your prescribed textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it will be because,
you know, we had the three co-authors but
[SPEAKER_00]: we also we collaborated for specific
areas, hydroponics, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collaborated with university professors
and people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are three authors listed who are
probably 30 people who also put
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than one person's opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds it sounds quite
comprehensive, which is always reassuring.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, on the question of sort of getting
into growing a bit, I'd be interested to
[SPEAKER_04]: hear what sort of style of growing do you
like to do and what do you advocate for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you an organics person, assaults,
or is it just not really meaningful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it really depends on the
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for instance, this year, well,
for the past few years, I've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: all my tomatoes hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like I live really like
hydroponics growing for indoor and some
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse situations, because you can
there are two things about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that not dealing with the crop or the
yield, but the inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that it really conserves water
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of water used to produce an
ounce of cannabis goes way down when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing hydroponics, when you're
growing in a sustainable hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the the other part about it is
that it's very changed, you can change,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can change the situation really
quickly with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, when you go from vegetative
to flowering, it becomes very easy to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you have a hydroponics system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very easy to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they increase yield usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as I said, I've been
growing hydroponic tomatoes, and people
[SPEAKER_00]: love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So proofs in the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have this theory about cultivation,
which is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so basically, during its
lifetime, the plant allocates a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: that it captures from the air,
you know, it captures carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a carbon that contains a carbon,
and then it allocates its use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say, so if let's say,
look at a plant, and if the plant has
[SPEAKER_00]: grown all these branches and leaves and
everything, well, in terms of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: allocation for the yield, we're looking
at, we're not harvesting the branches or
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, we're harvesting the buds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what percentage of the carbon is going
to bud production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what percent is growing to plant
infrastructure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at that, you realize
that if you grow small plants that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have much infrastructure, but for
instance, single stem plants, then a much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher percentage of the carbon that the
plant is allocating, is using,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant spends a greater
proportion of its time in bud production
[SPEAKER_00]: as compared with vegetative production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really into growing these small
plants really close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way to do it, you know,
like lettuce wraps, growing them like
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce wraps, like they were single stem
plants on lettuce wraps, and they won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: but 65 centimeters tall when they're done
with no branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the other advantage of that is that
there's very low, small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: manicure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a money saver as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's industrially, that's how I like
to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Sea of Green method,
you know, really proven itself over the
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I could tell, there wasn't a ton
of people still really doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's something that's going
to get more popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my writing partner, Rob Flannery and
I, we have been doing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: consultations, we're planning to do a
little bit of consulting on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that the problem for it is
you need a really skilled manager,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not so much staff, but management and
excellent SLP, so that everybody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening, because there's a lot of
action in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to, if you're growing
colons, which most farmers will do,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you need a large, you either have to
have a good colon supplier, or you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a large mother room to produce the
colons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of action in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most farmers they don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, even though they might have
done Sea of Green, you know, in a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, they can't see it expanding,
you know, when they upscale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe a watch this space sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, you know, there are a couple
of companies that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just an incredible system for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they don't have any plant care
during the vegetative and flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they set the plant, they don't have
to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as compared with, you know,
people that go de-leafing and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that they, you know,
and a lot of that, even if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: de-leafing, you wouldn't have to do as
much of it with this system as with
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's faster and higher yielding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it'll be really interesting to see
that sort of come to life more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we fast forward to the other end of
the growth cycle, when you're harvesting,
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember a discussion I had with someone
for a long time was they read your books
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were like, oh, did you know that
Ed says you should wet trim?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, oh, I didn't know if I'd read
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be interested to hear, you know,
do you believe wet trimming is better than
[SPEAKER_04]: dry trimming?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you fall one way or the other?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think it's sort of situationally
dependent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends, it's situationally
dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly it's easier to take your,
if you've, it's easier to run buds through
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the trimming machines when they're
wet, although they do have, they do have
[SPEAKER_00]: other models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is when you trim,
when you dry, when it's dry, you have more
[SPEAKER_00]: brittleness of the trichomes so that
you're going to have more fall from
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes when you do dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's certainly sort of pros and
cons in each situation, isn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you dry and cure has a
significant effect upon the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes that are present at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the method that seems to be most
effective seems to be freeze drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the cryo-curing machine where the
bud is dried and then you get a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of terpenes that often double
what you would from normal drying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's hugely become a major
discussion point in sort of the research
[SPEAKER_04]: recent year or so, especially for the
bigger commercial producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we focus on the smaller home grower for
the moment, I'd be interested to hear your
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the big mistakes you see
growers making that you think are holding
[SPEAKER_04]: their cultivation back from, you know,
being that really next level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing is being too ambitious
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, don't build the system that you
can't take care of, that's so big that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't take care of it, that you're always
behind because you're going to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens to me all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have bigger eyes in my effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you shouldn't do what happens to me,
especially if, you know, if I do an
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment and it doesn't work out,
it doesn't really affect whether I have
[SPEAKER_00]: bud or not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a different way of looking at it
on a personal level, but you shouldn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's so ambitious that it has
good chance of failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to do something smaller really
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the most important part of
growing or the most important factor in
[SPEAKER_00]: growing is the quality of the genetics
because no matter how good a garden you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, if you don't have the genetics,
you're not going to have good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics is number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what a brilliant segue you've just
given me, because I wanted to ask you a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit about popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think specifically that it's sort
of important for growers to be popping
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and keeping the wheels churning on
things, finding new clones, or do you
[SPEAKER_04]: think that there's not really any issue
with people just growing the same clones
[SPEAKER_04]: repeatedly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's go back to tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might try new varieties and then
you might grow some of the same old
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties because you like them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see cannabis as being
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess the next question would be,
do you have any advice for any aspiring
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: How might you advise them about how they
go about creating their crosses or
[SPEAKER_04]: collecting their seed stock?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's any tips you might be
able to offer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tag everything and keep immaculate
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't wait to tag something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tag it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you work on the project, right then,
you're not done till everything is tagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would even tag things as you're
doing the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't avoid all mix-up by keeping accurate
records at the time that you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say, oh, I'll write it all out
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was the yellow one the G4 or was it the
scum?
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't smoke two joints before you
start doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some great advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some great advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: As someone myself who's very particular
about getting the lineages corrected,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can throw my weight behind that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be curious to know, are there any
breeders who you really back the work of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, who are your favorite breeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are some local people who are,
Mark Rayshock, I really like his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shubinsky, his stuff, you know,
of course, everybody likes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just met him very briefly three weeks
ago, of all places, at a psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was leaving as I was coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the first time I met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a huge fan of that Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the fan submitted questions as we
sort of get towards the end of our
[SPEAKER_04]: questions was they were hoping you might
be able to give us a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_04]: backstory on the Ortega clone that came
from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, what was it like?
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And was there any backstory behind how you
found it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ortega clone was given to me by a
fellow who said he was just passing
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I never saw him again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up to give out varieties to
different people, different varieties to
[SPEAKER_00]: different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a friend of mine, Doug, got another
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of another indica that was very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he lost that after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know where the Ortega is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the J27, it came from a different
group, but from that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was saying that that's now a
proprietary variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how there can be complexity to
things, but it was originally my variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after I was raided, I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody gave it back to me like
20 years, just a year ago, 20 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it was the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quality is good, but it's a very weak
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a clone, you know, clone to
clone to clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just using genetics to
strengthen the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to get that plant onto the
market soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing stuff right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me wonder, what's the oldest
clone that you're aware of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say these J27s that I was
talking about, I know that that has only
[SPEAKER_00]: been a clone plant for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite some time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 23, 24 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, it's clone to clone to
clone, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I saw that plant, I recognized it
immediately, you know, from that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to hear, because you must have
seen so many plants over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any old varieties that we don't
see anymore that just really hold a
[SPEAKER_04]: special spot in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Romulan was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, there are so many good
plants out there now, but really what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for, you know, I mentioned those
plants that could smell up a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to find those original plants
or something close to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please reach out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard other guests talk about how
the focus of breeding going forward might
[SPEAKER_04]: be to try to produce some of these thio
rich plants, which are hypothesized to
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe be the plants that, you know,
really stink up the whole room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you done any research or looked into
thio rich plants at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's finding the terpenes that
contain that, because it was within the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my most recent studies have been on
industrialization processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing methods that can be integrated
with machinery, for instance, for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been spending my time on that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one of the questions we got from
one of our listeners was, are there any
[SPEAKER_04]: current grow technologies that you think
are going to become outdated quite
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly, or at least we'll look back on
and be like, man, why are we doing it that
[SPEAKER_04]: way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the reason we had big plants was
because of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only allowed to grow 10 plants,
you want to grow the biggest 10 plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: could ever grow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have those... But that is
totally an artifact of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't naturally grow big plants
if plant count wasn't a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, especially with
industrialization, big plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first those regulations have to be
eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, I was to a farm called
Osweños in Colorado, it's about 30 acres,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they eliminated to three or 400 plants
per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was not... I mean,
there was a very productive garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there would be much more efficient
ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see how those
changes roll out over the coming years,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially if we get the abolishment of
plant numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just got a few fan submitted
questions before we get on to our final
[SPEAKER_04]: five, which are pretty quick, yes,
no type questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the questions our listeners were
interested in hearing is, are you able to
[SPEAKER_04]: give us a bit of the backstory or at least
demystify?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the real story behind Durban
poison?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so before the turn of the century,
early on in the 80s, there was a coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shop in Amsterdam called Transvaal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Transvaal is one of the provinces in
South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, it was run by South
Africans, and they were importing South
[SPEAKER_00]: African weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the weed came with seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought all their varieties,
and that planted a number of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Durban poison was outstanding in
all of them, and that's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've read in different things on the
internet that I've traveled to South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa and got that and everything,
and that sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I had, but I traveled to
Amsterdam and went to the Transvaal.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And were there ever any additional
genetics mixed in with it, or was it just
[SPEAKER_04]: pure South African as far as you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I presented it to the world,
it was pure South African.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a cool story.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other questions we got is sort
of along the same line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the listener asks, are there any early
or modern varieties that Ed is likewise
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for bringing sort of to the
community?
Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the old J1 and J2, but they're not really
available anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan, which I wasn't the originator of
Romulan, but it was obscure until I
[SPEAKER_00]: started cloning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those varieties, but it's been a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been doing that for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, not many people drive a
20 year old car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I adore J1.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's one of the best plants ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know why it's not still
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it was a harder plant to
grow because it had a lot of sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the best place to grow would be
like Spain or Italy, something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The J2 is much more manageable because it
had a lot of Indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the J2?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it J1 crossed to an Indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was a J2 where two Indicas were
crossed and then they were crossed with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I have to look at my records to get
what they were crossed with, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: an outstanding plant that they were
crossed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a plant that had certain other
qualities that made it a valuable plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increased the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other plant had a lot of hidden
stability in it, which made it sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize the J2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it was hybridized, it was pretty
uniform, which was very unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't usually have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The F1 generation is uniform and then the
F2 generation sorts out into all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the J2, it remained pretty
uniform throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little unusual.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does sound unusual, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question we had from one of
our listeners is, where does Ed see the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis seen in 10 years time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people will be growing the
cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that most, I think that in
addition to growing cannabis, I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the cannabis are going to be
produced by brewing beer and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes for the cannabinoids and for
terpenes will be transferred to yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, you know, people say,
oh, that's terrible, but just think about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No lights, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't need lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sugar water and a pail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and the yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then seven days later, or a few days
later, you know, the yeast have expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids that have been
transferred to their chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's much easier than growing
your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, growing, you don't have the light
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the time set up,
the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be a game changer, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's something to look forward to
seeing how that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be interesting indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a lot of our medicines are
made that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what point are cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody will have to wear a white lab
jacket.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll definitely change the producer
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it will be something totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I went, I visited Genentech a few
years ago and, you know, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: sprawling buildings and everything,
but, you know, the actual place where they
[SPEAKER_00]: make the, where the actual place,
the space where the, the medicines are
[SPEAKER_00]: made are basically, it's basically a
brewing, the brewing, either, either
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria or yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, then they refine them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we'll be able to do that
as consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting times ahead for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big thing will be the yeast
sports, you know, the yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will all depend upon what yeast you
get because different yeast will have
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoid and terpene recipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they become the strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: An off topic sort of question we got from
one of our listeners was, could Ed tell us
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit about what was some of the
worst advice he believed to be correct for
[SPEAKER_04]: the longest time before realizing it
wasn't true?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going into that because,
because somebody will hear it and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take that advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better to let it lie buried.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the listener was wondering,
would Ed be able to tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: about how Sensi came to offer the Ed
Rosenthal Super Bud strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you involved in that or was it a
namesake sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I actually had given them the
original seeds from that many years
[SPEAKER_00]: before, you know, before they introduced
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I gave them the original genetics,
but they worked on it for perhaps 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: before releasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about the Super Bud is that
it comes in very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come in a month or earlier than
your other varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in northern areas,
it eliminates the weather threat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely advantageous for
cashcroppers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no home gardener likes to see
their bud turn to mush overnight because
[SPEAKER_00]: the weather changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this eliminates that problem in many
cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so also, you know, in that line,
there's a Jack Harrah, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: popular, and there's a Mishka line for
Mishka in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a number of people in that,
in that series that have been honoured
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, while we're on the topic of
cashcropping or sort of in that general
[SPEAKER_04]: area, this was an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone was wondering, what's the most
you've ever seen yielded off one plant
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a friend of mine used to go grow
these gigantic plants indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they weren't yielding that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't seen any really giant plants
to rake about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second last viewer submitted
question was, they say, oh, about a year
[SPEAKER_04]: or more ago, I remember seeing a post
about Ed creating his own bagged soil
[SPEAKER_04]: blend alongside vital garden supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that still going ahead or is that
paused for the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was paused for this season
because of supply chain problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're planning to go ahead next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can still probably get it next
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the final viewer submitted question
before we do our final final five is,
[SPEAKER_04]: how do you feel the effects of the older
varieties versus the present day elite
[SPEAKER_04]: cuts fair?
[SPEAKER_04]: Many people nowadays talk about modern
cannabis as having a similar sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: feeling or effect, whereas the older
varieties, it's like they had their own
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of personality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel this sort of sentiment is true
or do you think that there's still
[SPEAKER_04]: variance in the modern varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's an incredible amount of
variation in modern varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially if you go off the
beaten track because there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands and thousands of
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other crop that is bred the way
this one is, you know, with so many people
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so much variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that brings us to our final five
quickfire questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we ask all guests.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first one is, what is the most
memorable cannabis experience you've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: had?
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be smoking hash, it might be
smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the one that just stands out the
most in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was with Nemo and I was smoking
some NL5 haze and it was like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: tripping on his haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, maybe that wouldn't have the same
effect now, but it was extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at his mansion, you know,
night making.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so jealous.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
was there ever a time when everyone you
[SPEAKER_04]: knew was like, oh, you got to try this new
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you finally tried it and you were
like, oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to remember the good experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good rule to live by.
[SPEAKER_04]: So next one was, if I had to drop you off
on a desert island with just three strains
[SPEAKER_04]: to cultivate and to smoke for the rest of
your life, which three would you take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd definitely take the J27.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might take the Super Bud and I would
probably, I'd go after a Sativa variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the modern Sativa varieties as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a nice little palette you've
got there to mix and match.
[SPEAKER_04]: So was there ever a variety that you
really wanted to get your hands on,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it just always eluded you and you
could never get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The original White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a fellow who had it and sold
the seeds to a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, but he never sold the exact
pure seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some variation, but he had a
pure variety of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't like him because he'd sold
the same variety to everybody exclusively.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he disappeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was his name, was that Ingenmar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You read his names on the forums,
but as you said, he just completely
[SPEAKER_04]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one for the ages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, onto our final question before we
wrap things up for today.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had a time machine and you could go
back anywhere in time, anywhere around the
[SPEAKER_04]: world, presumably to collect some seeds or
maybe even a clone, where would you go and
[SPEAKER_04]: what would you collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, the original area where a
plant or an animal started usually has the
[SPEAKER_00]: most diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to go back into Bhutan and
a little further east of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was before there was before
all those land races were contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a brilliant answer, a brilliant
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick reminder to all of our
listeners, head on over to edrosenthal
[SPEAKER_04]: .com, pick up your copy of the Cannabis
