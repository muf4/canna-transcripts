[SPEAKER_00]: of prolific coast seeds telling us all

[SPEAKER_01]: to do going forward and setting a few
things straight let's get into it all
[SPEAKER_00]: righty so a big thank you and welcome to
our next guest on the show the one and
[SPEAKER_00]: only coma of prolific coast seeds thanks
so much for joining us today cheers
[SPEAKER_00]: brother how's it going good my friend good
first question we love to ask people what
[SPEAKER_02]: are you smoking on at the moment uh
currently i'm smoking on some solventless
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry mamba from ridgeline reserve
grown by happy herb grown by ridgeline and
[SPEAKER_03]: then processed by happy cabbage got uh my
little five grams i'm allowed to buy in
[SPEAKER_03]: oregon they they'll let me buy a shopping
cart of liquor but i'm only allowed to buy
[SPEAKER_03]: five grams a day of rosin so there's that
but uh yeah just a few grams a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: grams a day going down the hatch as per
usual love it and so in general what are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the dispensaries you rate in
oregon because i remember when i was there
[SPEAKER_03]: very briefly it was a little hit and miss
yeah i mean um the dispenser that i work
[SPEAKER_02]: with uh has our strengths that are grown
under my guidance regularly fresh drops in
[SPEAKER_02]: bend and in hillsboro the fifth element um
you can check out archive seed bank for
[SPEAKER_02]: really good clone drops and and he
oftentimes has really good hash there too
[SPEAKER_02]: shit man oasis out on the coast has some
good some good herb and really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: scenery i mean like you said it ends up
being hit or miss because the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: oftentimes are just fluctuating on what
they're intaking so it ends up being kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of just like um you just chase the the
products more or less than than the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary because some of these guys like
a great example here is is the happy
[SPEAKER_02]: cabbage team they make drops let's say
they make um this really good flavor but
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't make it all the time well when
they do make it some dispensaries might
[SPEAKER_02]: get it some might not so you're kind of
chasing the drop versus chasing the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: you know this is a good dispensary or
something so it sucks when you're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside looking in but it's much easier to
follow the drops and follow the certain
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors you like whenever you're plugged
into it so the next time you come out here
[SPEAKER_02]: dude just let me know and i'll make sure
for sure you're plugged with some fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: fire we'll enjoy a dinner or something get
a drink or something brother uh you're too
[SPEAKER_00]: kind my friend i think what's really
interesting is kind of what you just
[SPEAKER_00]: touched on there where there's often a
common sentiment especially by like kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the more cali growers who kind of say
like oh you know the quality of growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: oregon isn't that good but as you alluded
to it's hit and miss and that's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much the case everywhere even in
cali it's pretty hit and miss so i guess
[SPEAKER_00]: the question is do you feel like there's
much of a difference in the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in general in oregon versus cali
or it's kind of just like a rivalry thing
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm not sure who started that whole thing
but obviously a bunch of really good
[SPEAKER_02]: growers migrated north and maybe some of
them migrated south you know like this
[SPEAKER_02]: whole west coast is it's a mecca for
cannabis it has been for decades we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been kind of on the forefront of a lot of
stuff but some of the best stuff that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have and we've gotten comes from the east
coast oh geez and sours and this isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from west this isn't from oregon or
cali so in my in my honest opinion i just
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's one of those dumb rivalry
things that people do you know it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: any sports rivalry or anything else it's
just a you're over there and we're over
[SPEAKER_02]: here so let's kind of gripe but i've
literally seen absolute chronic in both
[SPEAKER_02]: places and i've seen complete dog shit
weed in both places and the same goes for
[SPEAKER_02]: people and for growers and for prices of
food and for everything you know it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: hit and miss everywhere you go you can
find something good and you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: something bad it's not really like you
can't draw a line on a map and be like
[SPEAKER_02]: this is where all the good growers are and
everybody outside of this isn't as good
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like it's kind of silly there is
definitely a lot of really really good
[SPEAKER_02]: growers in california they have a giant
population they were ahead of the curve
[SPEAKER_02]: before a lot of places so like i said the
west coast has been a mecca but oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: like we have some really really good
growers here some great breeders some
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing projects and we definitely hold
our own as far as anything rosin hash
[SPEAKER_02]: anything herb all extracts you know
edibles like we have really good good
[SPEAKER_02]: people here so i love the state and it
really has been uh nothing more than a
[SPEAKER_02]: light in my life so i have nothing
negative to say about oregon there's
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously shit growers here but there's
shit growers everywhere so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really mean anything yeah that's a
sentiment i can definitely agree on
[SPEAKER_02]: so take us back to that same case where we
were smoked pot and i didn't want to sound
[SPEAKER_02]: stupid so i was like yeah and i had never
been stoned before i tried to smoke pot
[SPEAKER_02]: one time but i don't know i don't know if
it was like we were smoking fucking i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know what happened it just i didn't
get stoned so i told him yeah and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: like drop your backpack off and come to my
house we'll smoke some pot and i was like
[SPEAKER_02]: all right so i draw my backpack off we
walk to his house another fucking half
[SPEAKER_02]: mile We get to his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: His mom's gone at work for another three,
four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we walk in his back room and he pulls
out from under a love seat in his bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a fucking half a pound of wheat?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both in seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flash forward, this guy ends up being one
of my best friends and his dad is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking huge grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where this weed came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just took it from his dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: His dad has fucking hundreds of pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So flashback, he pulls out this giant sack
of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much weed is,
but I, it was a full gallon Ziploc freezer
[SPEAKER_02]: baggy stuffed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at least five or six ounces,
if not a full half pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a little plastic finger bong,
like one of the ones that's just barely
[SPEAKER_02]: bent back kind of at like a little like a,
like at a 45, it has finger grooves with a
[SPEAKER_02]: little finger carb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a bunch of people know exactly what
bong I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graphics ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the little plastic graphics ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got a little snapper bowl on it
and he just starts loading snappers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes like a couple of rips and then he
hooks me up and I'm instantly stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got stoned after like two hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fucked up and I was in love,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fell in love with weed instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had always had this like really weird
negative cloud hanging on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just fucking my childhood was dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just this like thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just felt right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt so good and funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was chewing sunflower seeds the whole
way to his house and I'm just sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: there and he's all, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, now he's all, you really want
to get stoned?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, you're going to take a giant
hit and cough it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the first time I've ever smoked
weed and I take this giant hit of pot and
[SPEAKER_02]: cough out the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've ever coughed smoke out,
you'll know it is fucking so harsh on your
[SPEAKER_02]: lungs and on your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just started dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I threw up on his floor,
all those sunflower seeds that I ate all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just looked at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He watched me throw up and I think he got
a kick out of making someone so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: They threw up and he's all, you have to
clean all that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, no, no worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll clean it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so fucked up, but we ended up
becoming really, really good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, good enough friends that he ended
up in prison not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've fucking been shooting them money
and shit just that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: His wife has, has money because he is one
of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did introduce me to this plant that
I, that I just absolutely adore and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: spend the rest of my life dancing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like I own forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is, he is one of my best friends and
Josh will see you on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, he's going to be out right before
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put him in dude in Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude just caught a case and has spent
the last two and a half, almost three
[SPEAKER_02]: years in prison as a parole violation
because he had an ounce of pot and five
[SPEAKER_02]: grams of BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really want everybody to wrap their
heads around that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking five grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one ounce of pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they put my friend in prison for
years of his life while his sons are in
[SPEAKER_02]: very important times at 10 and 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got little boys that are fucking turning
into young men and you're going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: their father away because he had a little
bit of a thing that makes him feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how crazy this is,
man?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're living in some type of weird,
I don't know what this is, but this is
[SPEAKER_02]: just some more really a nightmare where
you'll just destroy a family.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tear them all down and apart because a
man wants to make himself feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be out of your fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the shit that we deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Australia doesn't have it any
better, but it's just like, it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy to think that this is the land of
the free and shit like that will still
[SPEAKER_02]: happen to you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so free, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a real issue you've kind of
highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to extend on that a little bit,
what do you think is going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: future of the federal laws of cannabis in
the States?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fully decriminalized soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take their bad hammer off of it
and release the banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the next few years, there will be
interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already opened up interstate
commerce once for certain deals because,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck it, I can't remember if it was Nevada
or Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those states ran out of pot,
so they allowed one of the other states to
[SPEAKER_02]: move some pot over there and eventually
it'll be full interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll just have to pay your licensing
fees and then your transaction fees when
[SPEAKER_02]: something goes from one state to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to pay a fee on it and don't
get their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They built an entire system around this
plant being illegal, so it was basically
[SPEAKER_02]: tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put everyone in jail and then we make
them go through rehabs and shit and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we generate money from
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: They realized quickly that they could
generate fucking 10, 15, 20 times more
[SPEAKER_02]: revenue by just letting us have the plant
and just doing it like anything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: free market, letting free market run its
course.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never not going to smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans love pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've loved pot forever and we're just
going to enjoy it, whether they made it
[SPEAKER_02]: legal or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they finally gave up on that and
now they're just going to make their money
[SPEAKER_02]: this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a few years max and it'll be
federally decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of that has to do with them
wanting to get their own hands in on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be able to bank their own
weed money.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these fucking investors and a lot
of these people are cops and ex-governors
[SPEAKER_02]: and people that were totally opposed to
cannabis until they saw a way to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: ton of money off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely still have their little
cop buddies and their contacts and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: still fucking buddy-buddy with their
senator buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how circles work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they've always worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not oblivious to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figure a few years max, it's just a
money thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't put that much money on the table
and not expect everybody to want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about billions, not
millions, billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely it won't be too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, kind of funny, but also
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about investors being ex-cops and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about Stan, the man?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the sit with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It got me started on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly, I mean, I'll tell you honest
to God, I cannot fathom how that guy is
[SPEAKER_02]: welcomed in the cannabis community at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as he posted a picture of himself
in a police uniform and said, I was a cop,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're not welcome here, and I don't
want to be rude to police officers because
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that not all cops are the enemy or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that we're on one side and
they're on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got raised in the streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't fuck with cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how the fuck you guys
think that that dude talks to anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's just be real.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a cop for 10 years, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you think your buddies are?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you shut off your cell phone and
you're not Stan the man on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: who is your friends?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who comes to your parties?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whose house do you go to for birthdays?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you do fucking?
[SPEAKER_02]: You do it with other cops and cops
families.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were always a cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cops are cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now all of a sudden, there's this dude
who has access to all these weed people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's fucking a set?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and you think he's the only one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you would be a fucking fool if you
didn't realize the entire cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community on every level has some form of
someone undercover.
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government is not stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're definitely they're watching
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not oblivious to what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't think they've put their own
players in play?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be fucking silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, dude, I just don't know how people
don't realize some of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I definitely don't think we should be
welcoming them with open arms when they
[SPEAKER_02]: for decades tore apart our families.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put men and women in prison, took children
and put them in CPS programs, basically
[SPEAKER_02]: stealing fucking children now that we're
finding out about what CPS is a basically
[SPEAKER_02]: a child pedophile fucking hijacking
service.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've they've completely abused their
power when it comes to this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should not be just welcoming them
to our side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you made a bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now fucking laying it fucking laying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just get to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: And play now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's legal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sit your fucking ass over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch me make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch me enjoy my time with the plant that
I love that you used to fucking cause
[SPEAKER_02]: drama.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many times Stan put somebody
in jail for having weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many times a cop got to
fucking cause somebody's life some drama
[SPEAKER_02]: over a plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, I've had enough interactions
with them as a kid growing up,
[SPEAKER_02]: even as an adult, as far as cannabis goes,
that I know that we're on one side and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're on another side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and it's not just him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's my strong, strong
feeling that we need to defend our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we need to just be very aware of
who's joining and who we're welcoming and
[SPEAKER_02]: who we communicate with and who we allow
in our DMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking it with the buddy buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important for some people to not
feel like they're members like you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you're you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make an account.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can post weed shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can comment in the weed shit all day
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we should not be accepting everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can try.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can sit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be in the peanut gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for for certain people to get held up,
dude, you got to maybe prove who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe throw in a couple of decades of some
fucking I'm not a cop shit or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just threw it throws me off,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It throws me off because a bunch of people
a bunch of people are just totally
[SPEAKER_02]: oblivious with the potential for disaster
when you're allowing complete outsiders
[SPEAKER_02]: into such a such a fragile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, dude, this plant and then our
lives like a lot of us operate on thin
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like I don't want to say too much
and cause any drama for people,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our lines and we have our rules
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never needed to tell the rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck with cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a rule that you need to tell
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the automatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's auto mattress.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were little kids, nobody in the
neighborhood ever said, hey, don't talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just fucking do better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew not to talk to cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you a quick story.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I was sitting in a trailer with
this dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just sitting there smoking
cigarettes and this fucking ex con comes
[SPEAKER_02]: in all covered in tattoos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's sitting there all fucked up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was all spun out and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, give me a cigarette,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave him a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we left me and my friend,
Larry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were out on the street on our bicycles
for maybe fucking two minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this cop pulls up to us and goes,
hey, come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, you seen this guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he holds up a piece of paper that had
that dude's picture that we just saw in
[SPEAKER_02]: that trailer and it said five thousand
dollar reward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just fucking looked at the cop and I
was like, fuck, no, we ain't seen him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mind you, I'm a poor, very, very poor kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never seen five thousand dollars,
nor will I in my mind ever be seeing five
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fucking fucking cops like do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's before I've been the weed game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even in the weed game.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just like street shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know how we've come this
far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I saw a picture the other day of a
guy at a event.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was at like one of these weed events
and the cops, you know, they're there
[SPEAKER_02]: doing their like just patrols,
how they walk around and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this dude took a picture with the
cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, they used to bust us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they protect us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just laughed and I was like,
why the fuck would you take a picture with
[SPEAKER_02]: two Riverside County sheriffs and be like
they used to bust us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're our homies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not our homies, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not our homies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not your fucking homie,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just at some point it's got to be
like, dude, holy shit, this isn't a real
[SPEAKER_02]: thing I'm dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could just go on and on about
the madness of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the weed community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like everyone's losing their fucking
minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it shouldn't be it shouldn't be so
shocking to see silly shit happening in
[SPEAKER_02]: the weed community just because we smoke a
plant doesn't make us, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: safe from silliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some wise words in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get too into the various
topics of meme discussion, I want to dive
[SPEAKER_00]: into, let's go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd just gotten high with your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd established that connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what that first strain was
that you were smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least do you remember what it was
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just green mud that his dad grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: His dad was a grower in Texas in the early
90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was really risking the biscuit and
he had probably about a half an acre of
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor that he a little plot that I'd
seen maybe twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry, I'm completely congested by the
size of Gabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he had a little outdoor plot that we
had access to the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what strength his dad was
growing, but definitely good pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't seeded pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was his dad's little private
stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a really good green bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely for a young beginner smoker got
the job done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were always torched.
[SPEAKER_02]: His dad would leave like half smoked
joints on the lid of the doorways and
[SPEAKER_02]: windows, you know, like the little seal
like the above doorway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we would walk around the house,
we would just run our hand across the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of those doors because his dad would set
joints everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where he would hide them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would just get like half smoked
joints and get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, fucked up, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember feeling like I was like mildly
hallucinating, like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good, good fucking vibes,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely have the coolest memories of
starting my relationship with this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'll have those memories forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really funny times with those guys
with Josh and Ian that that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: forever, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking great to look back at the
beginning of smoking and falling in love
[SPEAKER_02]: with something that has such a huge impact
on your actual life and everybody's life
[SPEAKER_02]: around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's just a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you were growing up, it sounds like
you had access to, you know, more kind
[SPEAKER_00]: type of bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you aware that there was also like,
you know, the the reggies or was that just
[SPEAKER_00]: totally out of your world?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we just got whatever bud that was
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was just whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never anything special until I was
probably 16 or 17.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a pretty good chronic connect and
we used to just force feed that guy money
[SPEAKER_02]: because he was the only one who had
chronic that I'd ever seen, like real
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking chronic, chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was just random weed up until
then, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever we could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what was the first strain that
truly kind of inspired you, like maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: first name strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gee, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember like it was yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in fact, it's funny because my buddy
that's up here, I got a buddy from SoCal
[SPEAKER_02]: that came up here to kind of help me do
some growing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not rocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was at my house when it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: This kid came over to sell me some pot and
he had pure Kush, real Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I smoked some of it and I fucking fell
in love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never smoked weed like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt so good in my chest.
[SPEAKER_02]: My palate was just fucking it was like I
couldn't believe that I had been smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: weed this whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't that if that's my if I could
make a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was one of those moments where I
was just like dumbfounded that I had been
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking pot that wasn't that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is to this day, real good gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG crosses are just like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a place in my heart forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've heard a lot about the origins
of OG over the past year or so with the TK
[SPEAKER_00]: Origin guys popping up and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is behind it genetic
wise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, it's I don't even don't even go
down those roads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you why, because if you go
online and you look for lineage histories,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just a goddamn mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got stories of where chem came
from or sour OG and what it's named for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just all a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just could give two shits about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quickly realized that I don't have a lot
of time on Earth, so I don't fester into
[SPEAKER_02]: emptiness like I won't go into a rat's
maze at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I look at it from the top and I see
what it is, I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just won't waste my time doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something like that is exactly what
that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple other things like a great
example for me and my type of personality
[SPEAKER_02]: is learning about computers and doing what
you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a podcast that I'm about to
start and I'm waiting to find the right
[SPEAKER_02]: person to work with to do all my
engineering and all my post production
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it and I don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to start learning it, but it's
like it's a rat's nest right to me because
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do computers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like all of this shit that I
have to learn how to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that it's like,
like I said, I look down on it and I see
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just going to be a total fucking
chaos thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that when you go looking for any
strength, I swear to God, you can go find
[SPEAKER_02]: five stories for every single strain on
the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you go to somebody that
actually knows about cannabis lineage,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Archive or Riot, Riot actually knows
a lot of shit and Archive knows a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll quickly realize that most of the
shit on the internet is not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it's just like, why would I fill
my brain with false information or half
[SPEAKER_02]: information?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if something's fire, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's fire, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I like the way it tastes, if it breeds
true, just because something tastes good
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't mean it's going to make good seed
or breed true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to just go, you just got to get
in there and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if something's breeding good and it's
putting out good offspring, you can keep
[SPEAKER_02]: the projects moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's really where I'm at
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't go too deep on that,
on that whole internet bullshit trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good quality to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something I wanted to chase out what
you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some parents may taste good, but don't
necessarily make good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any popular clones out there
which you think fit that rule?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mac One.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mac One makes amazing flour and looks
fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every person who grows Mac, the Mac One
has frosty buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always has this really cool earthy
profile that like it's just different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of got a little bit of a mutant
slow veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got a little bit of a shitty
growth pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the most vigorous of growers,
but the buds are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not make seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard from everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've dusted it with three different studs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not make seed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's that's why we're going to move
into the F2s and maybe make a BX menu with
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the stuff like we're going to have
to work projects with it to try to find
[SPEAKER_02]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that gene marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just something about that plant
right out of the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only one that pops into my mind
that just won't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've fucking worked with hundreds of
plants and I can't think of anyone that's
[SPEAKER_02]: been that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it's amazing flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why people will still continue
to want the crosses of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pretty sure with some F2s or some
BX work, we could find the gene marker
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll promote seed production and we can
just work from there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: using that as a base marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it really is, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're breeding is you're just
looking for markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just looking for the right markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every breeders got different palates
and they have different ideas of what they
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that, you know, it's really,
it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all like little chefs, you know,
we're in our kitchens and you just have to
[SPEAKER_02]: find the one that you like the way the
food tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you like the way the food tastes,
then eat there and support that kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't fucking go eat somewhere
else, real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to quickly follow up on that one,
have you ever seen any of the Mac F2s that
[SPEAKER_00]: are maybe keeper females?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really struggling to find some
myself online.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't seen, I've seen some Mac
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also can admit that I oftentimes don't
stay up to date with what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so locked in to my own existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I do this, I have five
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have multiple grows that I have to look
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trade jujitsu five days a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, I'm just locked in,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the stuff that I do so that I
don't have a lot of time for other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a curse because I know that I'm
missing out on interacting with people and
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely about watching projects happen
and what people are up to and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one life, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just living my, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not trying to bother anybody or
cause drama.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking just hyper focused on living
my my existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just started skydiving, too,
which is fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just added one more thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see people's projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there probably is fire f twos or or,
you know, I'm assuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did did he not make f twos as he made f
twos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's made more originals as well,
but I just haven't really seen much come
[SPEAKER_00]: from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to also understand,
too, that just because someone's f ones
[SPEAKER_02]: were good doesn't mean that the f2 seed
stock will be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Matt kind of play that out to be
explained to me that it would be better
[SPEAKER_02]: for me to lock shit down through a BX menu
than actually using f twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see more variance through f twos and f
threes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe that Mac f two isn't as
good as f ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just honest opinion, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I know I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that I don't pay a lot of
attention to other people's projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's not really fair to ask me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to ask you something you just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you were streaming on a
sidetrack for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like streaming on Twitch these
days?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it's a little bit going downhill
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the grind, you kind of have to just
grind for a year or two to really like get
[SPEAKER_02]: in the grind.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a regular 20, 30 people
watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not a lot, but it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get I drink a little margarita.
[SPEAKER_02]: And smoke some dabs and play some video
games and laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I use it as just like how I do
my IG live where I'm just sitting there
[SPEAKER_02]: talking on the grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I'm playing games.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to set it up where I'll be
sometimes watching YouTube videos while
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see my face and the YouTube video
so we could do like commentary on stupid
[SPEAKER_02]: videos and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to have it set up a little
different, but it's fun, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a I don't know, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking for Instagram fucked us
all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent years on Instagram building an
audience for them to just take it away,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got a shadow band because I like
certain posts and I share certain posts
[SPEAKER_02]: and I say certain keywords.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter what anybody knows or
thinks, they're listening to what you do
[SPEAKER_02]: and they watch everything you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all through the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it has nothing to do with some
person sitting in some office going,
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to shadow bank over the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dude, if you like certain posts and
let's say let's say a great example is
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll just I'm assuming I don't know for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know what happened to my posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started talking about things that were
against the grain, but are 100 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: factual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as that happened, I started
seeing it and it got worse and worse and
[SPEAKER_02]: worse to the point to where my interaction
is like less than one percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they just took away my whole
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't I just feel like I wasted
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: People know who come with a grower is and
they know who prolifico seed is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But imagine if I had access to my hundred
and thirty thousand followers and only
[SPEAKER_02]: twenty thousand of them were real people
that followed me and I made a T-shirt for
[SPEAKER_02]: sale every month.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could sell what, five thousand T-shirts
out of my thirty thousand real followers,
[SPEAKER_02]: five thousand T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold a month with a ten dollar profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't they don't want you to make
money on Instagram, not without paying
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I make a post, it says promote.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want me to give them money for my
post to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they purposefully don't let them be
seen because they know that it triggers a
[SPEAKER_02]: thing in my head that pisses me off and I
want it to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have the money, you're going to
pay for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how a lot of these businesses have
stayed successful on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just pay the advertising money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've thought about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I just pay for the advertisement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about it won't let me do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's because I'm a
stubborn Irish asshole or if I just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: like if I don't like Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is, but I'm not
giving them a fucking penny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is what it is, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touch on a really important issue in
terms of how the algorithms are affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think ultimately people will get so
sick that we'll just get off Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there'll be some sort of
compromise?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they'll ever compromise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just had a post removed today for
against their against their terms and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was just a weed post.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they'll ever compromise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that it'll be very much
longer before something comes along that
[SPEAKER_02]: will take people's attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the same with my space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something came along.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Facebook was out, nobody thought
Instagram was going to be as big as it
[SPEAKER_02]: was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming something eventually will
come along right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram is just very easy for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're using it out of out of ease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a few other things like
cannabis and stuff, but they just I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't function as easy as Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our customer bases are on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where everybody is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to make money or generate
revenue in any way or build any type of
[SPEAKER_02]: momentum towards generating revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to be in front of my customer base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where all these people are is
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now they kind of have us by the
balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nothing we could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just kind of got to just go with
it and just it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, there's really nothing you
can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see them ever changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do see people getting tired of it
eventually, but there's nothing that I see
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to take anybody yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump back to the story for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we go from smoking the chronic to
then having your first grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to grow for a second in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know anything about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy brought over a high pressure
sodium bulb ballast and hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought it for 250 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I set it up in a little trailer,
like a little trailer, but a shed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had no AC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was summer in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't realize, like I didn't know
anything about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, shit, it's like 140
degrees in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any plants in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just set it up just as like,
see how the room would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never grew right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just started growing outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I grew weed outside probably maybe
like three, four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew once outside in Texas with a failed
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once in Texas, when I was 15,
failed harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not get our buds all rotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all like fucking disgusting and
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: 17, 18 and 19, we grew pot outside in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Decent harvest, like nothing to write home
about, but definitely learning about
[SPEAKER_02]: growing pot and learning about getting
better with the plant for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't grow weed for a long time after
that until I got here at 26 and started
[SPEAKER_02]: growing indoors here in Oregon,
26.
[SPEAKER_02]: To now for the last 10 years growing weed
inside here pretty much consistently every
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer, killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what was the first big name clone
you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: First big name clones I got were OG cuts
from Rascals Crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I traded Piasso Grow and Sneaky Farms
clones, and they brought some stuff up
[SPEAKER_02]: from Southern Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brought me a Wi-Fi 3 and the Fire Cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the first real clones I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd grown some good pot before,
but I had never like done it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be like knocked out, packs on packs,
a chronic and really like changed my
[SPEAKER_02]: position on the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those clones really helped me change
my spot for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started just doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking day and night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went from second gear to fucking just
straight pinned fifth gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was fucking crazy how fast
everything changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like quick little story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were struggle, struggle, struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got those clones, vegged out a big ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had 12 hoods in this garage,
all OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll see if my kids are crying.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I filled it up with all that OG,
the Wi-Fi 3 and the Fire, and I got like
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 19 pounds, 20 pounds of like real
good solid top nugget and sold all that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit at 28.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I'd ever fucking
just lump come up like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was always a struggle before,
you know, you would like harvest weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: have to try to like sell a pound to this
guy, sell a half pound to this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're just like hustling to
sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had real gas for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like gas, gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shit was just fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were crazy times, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Fire OG was the first real good
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Fire OG, not Fire OG, just Fire
Cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fire OG is probably just renamed,
something renamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was basically Saturn OG,
Jupiter OG, all these fucking they're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the same three OGs renamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, dude, a handful of OG cuts and
don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the first OGs came over, they did
what OGs like to do, which is throw S1
[SPEAKER_02]: here or there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people found a seed here or there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little S1 made a little pollen here or
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was OG hybrids made real quick on
accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then OG S1s that were planted right
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, someone finds a seed in something
that's really, really dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing, if they're a grower,
the first thing to do is throw it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Fire Cut is definitely not Fire OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rascal made sure he I didn't know that
he's the one who schooled me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So props to him for making sure that the
true stories get told instead of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, muddied up history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how happy he was that I got
those cuts, to be honest, but I definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: got the Wi-Fi 3, the Fire Cut from Piasso
and Steaky Farms, and it did fucking save
[SPEAKER_02]: my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So props to everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really don't know what to say,
but that was the first real, real dank
[SPEAKER_02]: that I got in the first time that things
changed on my board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the question is, is it still
your favorite of like the OGs or what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your favorite?
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite OG is TK for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like pure TK is fucking unmatched.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just a, if you gave me good chem,
I would like, you know, I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real sour, real chem, real sour,
real TK.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all right there with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love them all to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was it then that stimulated you to
begin Prolific Coast Seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much just by failed running of
other people's seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I grew weed for years and for a long
time I was growing other people's seed and
[SPEAKER_02]: seed I was buying off the internet and
just regularly coming up short,
[SPEAKER_02]: even to the point I've said this before,
to the points where I was questioning
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if I was even a good grower,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what the fuck was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was just having a really hard time
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got those cuts, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me realize real quick,
I was worth 3000 a pound, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in a busted market, nobody had no
fucking weed money in Oregon, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this place was dog shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even in a market that's falling apart,
I was eating and I quickly realized it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all this whack ass fucking weed I
was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a bunch of people here that
still do it to themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Oregon, like you said, the booth
growers of Oregon, how they have this like
[SPEAKER_02]: bad name.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is just the strains they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not bad growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just growing fucking weird strains
that are not like heat heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that being said, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, to me, it just seems like to me,
it seems like we we made a choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a choice that we were going to
lead our own destiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew right away that I could do the
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew exactly what it was to make seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't oblivious to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a bunch about breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's still a bunch of stuff about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love to learn and I'm getting better
regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just knew that I could do a good job at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was an important position in the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis industry that needed to be
taken a little more serious than a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people were taking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we made the first group of crosses and
we gave them to our friends to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing was for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually only making seed for me and
my crew, me and my immediate homies,
[SPEAKER_02]: just so we could all have fire and sell
packs of fire, new crosses that nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: else would have.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seed was so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends were like, you have to sell
this, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody told me the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, bro, I just tested 30 cake
bomb, 30 case Morris, 30 male,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 honey tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit's all fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was saying the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got multiple keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fucking I heard that from
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got multiple keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you hear that multiple keepers,
that's like a green light because I had
[SPEAKER_02]: popped hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
of seeds and found nothing that I could
[SPEAKER_02]: keep, nothing that I can make money off
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all had the names and all said cherry
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Kush that or fucking OG this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But none of it was gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of it was cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of it was OG or Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I'm sitting over here pulling my
dick, telling my wife, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be different this time,
babe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have straight fucking kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was a kill again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was a kill again.
[SPEAKER_02]: How the fuck am I supposed to look at her
in the face and tell her?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I look at her in the face and tell
her it's going to be killed?
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't going to be killed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to fix that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got people that are relying on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big reason why I was able to learn how to
grow and do this job well was fuck,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, if I didn't do it well, we were
going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty simple, pretty easy to be good at
something when you don't have a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went all in with with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which you're all in, you're all in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't pull the chips back,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how the casino works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some real honest motivation right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've worked with a lot of different
OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you feel they pair best with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is a good breeding
partner for an OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really like fruity pot or like
exotic, like profiles really in pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them in dabs, but I don't really
like them in the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you put OG studs, with like a lot
of this stuff, the profiles are like
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect because they still taste a lot of
the offspring still taste gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's these just undertones on the
back end of whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know if it's just my studs,
because my studs really do breed heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I dust something that has no OG in
it, a lot of the offspring comes out with
[SPEAKER_02]: OG profiles, a lot of threes and fives,
a lot of that legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way they look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely the way they smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, you'll you'll find so
often times that a lot of the offspring
[SPEAKER_02]: has these undertones and these side angles
of whatever was dusted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just really feel like it goes good
with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ends up being just about individual
partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: If those partners mesh well, kind of the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some females won't accept pollen
and they won't make seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be that specific male to that
specific female where that female would
[SPEAKER_02]: accept seed from maybe her brother or from
a different stud.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she won't accept pollen from that
stud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that she won't accept pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Mac one is a great example there
where you could touch it with a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: different pollens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it doesn't like to make seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why those seeds are so fucking
expensive when they go to market,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's not a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: In theory, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have asked you before,
but I forgot when you were kind of before
[SPEAKER_00]: you got into your breeding days,
were there any breeders you particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: like the work of or maybe even looked up
to and thought, yeah, like this guy really
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, as far as knowledge,
as far as knowledge goes, I really feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like Matt and Archive, they fucking are
like human encyclopedias.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dudes know pretty much what needs to
be known.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if the earth was going to
end tomorrow, you want to take these two
[SPEAKER_02]: fuckers and stuff them in a hole somewhere
so that way they don't so we don't lose
[SPEAKER_02]: all the weed lineage because they know
they know all the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really both really fucking sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked up to karma a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The karma crew are some just absolute
legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I truly feel like this like time tells
the story with breeders and with people in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And karma has been here for fucking a long
time, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't done shady shit to people
over all these years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they haven't fucking lied to people or
made some waxy drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they've proven time and time again
what their character is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what it is to me is like all
the bullshit aside, dude, fucking time
[SPEAKER_02]: never lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time always tells the story and time's
fucking never been defeated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we all get the story in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just I looked up a lot to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked up to HSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked up to I mean, I still do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not that I looked up to them,
but I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where I'm a young younger breeder,
kind of like I definitely had a few people
[SPEAKER_02]: that were always I was always looking
forward to hearing talk and always looking
[SPEAKER_02]: to learn from and see what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is kind of your general vision or
trajectory you'd like to take PCS in?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of pretty big ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to just, you know, it's like PCS to
the world pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want people to have a shot at
growing real gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in some fucking third world
country and you buy seeds, which people
[SPEAKER_02]: do, you know, I mean, I could honestly
tell you most people don't have gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people in the states don't have gas,
especially places like Vermont or fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma or Kansas or South Dakota or
these like off the wall states that never
[SPEAKER_02]: had weed programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like nobody really set up there and
shit big.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have access to clones and they
don't have access to good OG or sour or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So me making the crosses and making the
seed and making what I made and what I do
[SPEAKER_02]: make is for a purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want people to have access to that
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing that happened to me where
when I just finally got gas, my whole life
[SPEAKER_02]: changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were struggling every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day was a struggle and we didn't
know how the bills were going to get paid
[SPEAKER_02]: next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just would hope that it was going to be
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big ups to my man, Boost Freak,
because that little motherfucker saved my
[SPEAKER_02]: life so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even, I'm telling you,
but I've had a couple of homies out here
[SPEAKER_02]: that I just cannot imagine what I would
have done without these people in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm here now because of the support
that I was shown by a few really close
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, in reality, dude, like that's
where it ends up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kind of got to, you got to just
understand that you're going to set your
[SPEAKER_02]: own pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to set your own mission and
we've set our own pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't rush menus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people's like, where's the
next menu?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the next menu?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to sell you guys something
that's not ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to sell you anything that's
not proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just finished what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're waiting to do these giant hunts that
way I could truly look through the gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I don't know, it is what it
is, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a ton of people online that are
supporting PCS, whether we instantly
[SPEAKER_02]: launch or launch the next menu or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I feel really comfortable with my
position and we're just going to do what
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done consistently the whole time,
which is not fuck with anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't lie to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't rip anybody off and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I truly feel like it's the best advice
I could give to any young entrepreneur
[SPEAKER_02]: coming into the cannabis industry or any
industry in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't be a piece of shit and you're
already ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're already 80 percent ahead of the
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's fucking only you're already in the
top 20 percentile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't rip anybody off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't lie to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do anything shady or sell some
fucking cut car pins or fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody's always trying to get over
on everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're already in the top tier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get back to that topic in a
little bit and you'll know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about when we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the moment, let's jump back a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the process like for creating the
PCS1 mail, like guide us through its
[SPEAKER_00]: genesis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I basically had a pretty big hoop house
outside that I was just not sure what I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I flowered out a bunch of Casper OG
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, in reality, I didn't find any females
that I liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not even going to use the Casper OG
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to use a Scato Gmail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to go a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have at the time, I have a really,
really good Scato Gmail, probably one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the better cuts that I've ever come across
and found in my life that I found from
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I'm one of the only few that has
this specific cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had given it out to a couple people,
but it's pretty, pretty close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dusted that Scots with the really
gassy OG dog Casper OG male that I found.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I collected that seed, I probably had
maybe 3000 seeds, 5000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quickly gave a shitload of them to my
friends and I only planted maybe 150 of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not find what I was looking for in
the first group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll quickly explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was searching for short.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really had this concept that if I
could find an incredibly short OG dog
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, then I could defeat the one thing
that causes issues in everybody's OG
[SPEAKER_02]: projects, which is this lanky shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: OG has this fucking tendency to just run
on everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was specifically looking for a gene
marker, like I told you earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was going to promote this short plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the next step was to touch my
Wi-Fi 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know the Wi-Fi 3 just happens to be
a short OG structured plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like gas, tastes fire,
but it does not grow like a lot of OGs
[SPEAKER_02]: like the San Fernando Valley or the
fucking TK how they'll run on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get leggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wi-Fi 3 does not get leggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know if I could get this second,
this fucking first layer done on a short
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, and I'm going to dust this Wi-Fi 3,
then I'm going to have this double G
[SPEAKER_02]: marker of short plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second time I went through that seed
stock, I planted 200 plus seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found an incredibly gassy OG dog plant
that was fucking short as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dusted my Wi-Fi 3 with that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mind you, the whole time I'm dusting a
bunch of other shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a bunch of these projects,
like all types of side project.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's where the mill came from,
was me dusting this Wi-Fi 3 with that
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter stud from the Casper on the Scots,
which are both leggy, mind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Scots is leggy and the Casper is
leggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just a total random find that I
found a short child from that cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wi-Fi 3 cross was 175 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we dusted the Wi-Fi 3 and I found the
PCS1 stud, I instantly knew which one I
[SPEAKER_02]: liked out of the crop, out of the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I isolated them, took a bunch of cuts
and started making the projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: like started using him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That first one from seed I've since just
been taking cuts of cuts and just keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: him alive and keeping him in my rooms in
vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime ready to go, anytime he's ready to
bust a net, always hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the attributes or
characteristics of males that you like to
[SPEAKER_00]: look out for when you're selecting
something or is it more of a by feel
[SPEAKER_00]: thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, you have to, you have to do,
well, Archive said something that was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, you know, that's what's cool
about reversals is you can taste the male
[SPEAKER_02]: before you have the male pollen because
you're reversing a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of know where you're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a ton of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I didn't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have other projects in the
future and it's something I probably will
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as my selecting, I was just
selecting on vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was selecting on, on actual growth
pattern and that's a lot about all I could
[SPEAKER_02]: select on, you know, smell vigor and how
it actually is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, when I took clones, you got to
realize, I guess I didn't explain when I
[SPEAKER_02]: chose the PCS1 male, there was a whole lot
of males in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I took the clones, you know,
there's probably four or five males that
[SPEAKER_02]: are pretty short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's another four or five that
are not that short, but still gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of these males is going to be
PCS1.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I took the clones, I, I, the first
thing I'm looking at is which ones are
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's instant vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's telling me a real important story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PCS1 male that I did select was
absolutely the first one to start rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fully rooted at like eight
days, completely rooted, ready to be
[SPEAKER_02]: transplanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So completely full of vigor, OG doll,
short structure, just everything that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can, if you were going to draw one up,
it would be what you would want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It has what you need from the OG and it
has what you don't want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I did exactly what I tried to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It breached true, everything it touches
turns to gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just an incredible, incredible
first, first stud to come out the gate
[SPEAKER_02]: with and make some really good projects
for people to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just briefly spoke about how many
seeds you like to pop and how many you had
[SPEAKER_00]: popped in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty nice numbers you had there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess as a general rule of thumb,
obviously people can do amazing work with
[SPEAKER_00]: small number of seeds, but in your mind,
what are the numbers you'd like to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with to feel confident that you were doing
the project justice?
[SPEAKER_03]: In reality, a couple hundred per,
if I'm really selecting at least a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a little bit of a over, like I,
I just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we found keeper case Morris,
I was kind of like, fuck, cause I had
[SPEAKER_02]: already seen kids online with what I
thought maybe might be better case boards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I'm like, that kid only popped
20 seeds and I popped fucking 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I'm always a perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me want to go back through case
wars and pop even more of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he very well may have had the better
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my, in my eyes, it's a couple
hundred, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could find heat in a 10 pack,
20 bag, dude, and just find absolute kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But breeding a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely nice to be able to look
through, through seed stock, at least a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred, a couple hundred would be
probably, probably a little bit better
[SPEAKER_02]: for, for us as breeders, as we're looking
for as many, as many variables as we can
[SPEAKER_02]: find here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how would you feel if someone bought
say one or two packs of your gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: found a male and started breeding with
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, a bunch of people hit me up and
asked me if they could use my stuff for
[SPEAKER_02]: their projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have any problem with that at
all, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what this whole thing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, if your projects are
good, people will like them and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be better pot out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any qualm with people making
money, people making good chronic people,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking and chronic, like all of that
sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as you don't go green,
naming shit and changing names and taking
[SPEAKER_02]: my lineage away from me, then I'm fine
with whatever people do with my seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be honest, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome attitude to have,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the plants you want to
work with going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of the females you plan to
breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be
doing a bunch of TK stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of, I'm going to be doing some
chem work and some sour work, making some,
[SPEAKER_02]: some chem and sour hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, dude, I'm just going to be
sticking with what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing that I've done the
whole time, which is just a lot of gassy
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids and tried to bring, bring girth
from the chem side of my chem four line
[SPEAKER_02]: into a lot of these, these other projects
that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically chem sour OG, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem sour OG for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tried and tested combo,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's where a lot of
breeders have gone weird, where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: all trying to be like the next,
they're trying to make the wheel over
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a bunch of hybrids that are
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be made with chem sour and OG,
different OG profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem 91 is not the same as chem four.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of different sour diesel
profiles that are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's fucking see where this shit
could take us and then introduce some of
[SPEAKER_02]: this land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to throw an entire new
palethora of, of hybrid F1 fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: offspring out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, dude, that's where it really,
we got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to work on our end before we're
just like, you know, let's just fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix and match with this garbage from the
Hills of Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been growing at fucking 10% THC for
the last 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's genetic diversity in
there that we don't have that could change
[SPEAKER_02]: ours, but let's build ours up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make sure our shit's super fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like it's all fresh and brand
new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't even come close to touching the
tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual, the actual beast that is
within our potential with our,
[SPEAKER_02]: our diversity we have now with our
libraries we have now, it's just like
[SPEAKER_02]: unlimited potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just ready to see what we could do
as far as with our chems and sours and
[SPEAKER_02]: our, our different hybrid projects,
because I really feel like there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: left to untouch that's untouched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you touched on a staple of the show,
the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is your favorite?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem four, chem four for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got this amazing, juicy, big bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I don't like about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes about 11, 11, maybe even a 12
weeks to finish properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't like that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little fickle to grow too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're already working on making some
hybrids that carry that same profile over,
[SPEAKER_02]: but finish a little bit early eight,
nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still have the same that that taste is
fucking so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost unmatched.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely love chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fucking such a beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have chem and OG hybrid flavor in
sour, like those, the potential there is
[SPEAKER_02]: everything to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm after is just working
these chems and these OG lines together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given your experience with the OGs,
when you look at your chem plans,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you see any relationship there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think they're just different?
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be, there might be,
but chems tend to be much leggier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they, they have, dude,
I'm sure it's all somewhere tied together
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cousin or a mom or something,
you know, but I just, they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I could say, yeah,
I could say maybe I could see it because
[SPEAKER_02]: they both have a, definitely have a gassy
profile like real OG and real chem have
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of this, this funk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things where I'm just,
does it matter if they're related?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really, I mean, if they are,
they are, if they're not, they're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're both fire as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one of those things like I don't
really pay much attention to, cause it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't matter either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you consider the OG high and you
think about that kind of commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: associated terpene profile, the fuely
lemony cushy type of thing, would you,
[SPEAKER_00]: A, consider that your favourite and B,
do you think that that's part of the high
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you think that that just happens to
be the terpene profile associated with OG
[SPEAKER_00]: cush and it's more like the cannabinoid
profile that does it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, our highs, how we get high is all
individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have our own individual cannabinoid
systems and they react with THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually terpenes that are kind of
the driving force on how people feel when
[SPEAKER_02]: they smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, dude, I've just loved the way that
it's always has tasted gas like that
[SPEAKER_02]: profile and how there's no ceiling with
OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like other strains I could smoke and
after a couple of weeks, I won't get high
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like keb, sour, OG and cookie,
real good cookie crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will always get high if I smoke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smoke OG for 30 years straight and
I'll get stoned every fucking time,
[SPEAKER_02]: every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I smoke like green dragon or some
fucking random strain from somebody,
[SPEAKER_02]: like after a couple of days, I just won't
get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: My body will quickly, quickly adapt to it,
but there is no ceiling on OG or cam or
[SPEAKER_02]: sour period.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody agrees with me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to fucking hundreds of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always gets you stoned and that's why
it'll always have its place because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the fucking king, the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is it do you think that is
required in a strain for it to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: ability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we often hear this topic brought
up among guests where they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like it's just got no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep getting higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just quality or is it like a certain
profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it's lineage because it is
seems to be the same group of plants it's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from, which is OGs, kebs and sours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cooking hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it's most people are reacting
the same way to most strains, but there
[SPEAKER_02]: are some people that are off, like they're
not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I'm saying we all have
different endocannabinoid systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of us have similar cannabinoid
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we can agree some, you know,
oh, this gets me really stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that smoke stuff
that agree on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a handful of people that
don't agree on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like they're wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their bodies just don't react the same to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not you'll hear people talk about,
oh, this makes me really nervous and freak
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, yeah, that's the way
you react to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way your body's reacting to it,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you probably drink fucking wine
coolers and freak out, too, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what's happening when you get
high?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just on a little personal note
before we wrap up, on the OG stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the OGs that I really, really
loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly, I haven't tried them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about Triple X OG from
Oregon Kid?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that backfired on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon Kid is a OG, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's definitely not going to be girl with
snickle fritz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if he's got something that he's bought
his name on, I'm sure it's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's definitely an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows what gas is and he knows what
tank is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely trust him.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody said I got something from
Oregon Kid, I would assume it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be gas in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first thing I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure it's probably good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of touched on cookies here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, you've done some cookies
cross OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's one of the better
pairings you can do with cookies like
[SPEAKER_00]: cross to an OG male?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, dude, the the problem with the
cookie crosses is they all carry the same
[SPEAKER_02]: marker from the first cookie, which is an
unstable marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was made with C.P.K.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an unfinished project.
[SPEAKER_02]: The C.P.K.
[SPEAKER_02]: went S1 and either pollinated the Derm or
fucking something in their garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it pollinated,
but there was never a male to female that
[SPEAKER_02]: made Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an accidental pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they started selling packs of that
plant that they grew out from that
[SPEAKER_02]: accidental pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant had the same marker that
its mama, daddy had where it would throw
[SPEAKER_02]: S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every pack that comes out has a few
seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in the Bay was buying cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a seed here.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, there are people started planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you got OG KB forum and these
other other cookie hybrids that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: just they're just are where people started
making all the cookie hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it was coming from was from
the S1 lineage that was coming straight
[SPEAKER_02]: out of their their garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think kept us wanting on every
everybody who touches that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll still and it carries through into
all the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing that has cookies in it is going
to be like super stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people online complaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, you know, a lot of these
European breeders have way more stable
[SPEAKER_02]: gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, the shit is fucking 12
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you want to grow fucking dog shit
weed, you grow it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growing fucking elite hybrids and
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG sour kev, that shit has a G marker that
says I want to self reproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not going to give me pollen,
that's what a plant's doing the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growing as a bud swelling the whole
time at 1212.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just waiting for pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second you touch it with pollen,
it doesn't grow like it used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But plants that make big ass buds,
they don't make big buds after they're
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They focus all their energy on making
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what that is, is that thing is
swelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just putting pistols further and
further away as from its mass,
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially making a larger surface area
to potentially collect a piece of pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, at some point, people got
to realize there was never a male or
[SPEAKER_02]: female that made cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they never sold cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they finally did sell seeds,
they ripped everybody, Jigga ripped
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody off and sold them London pound
cake and candy paid and all these seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that were just herby trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the biggest snickle fritz that's ever
happened in the weed industry's history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking crazy, crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the it's not denying the fact that
they had access to one of the best tasting
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts I've ever fucked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever that was that did the self
pollination in their garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they grew it out and named it Girl
Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shit tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does inherently have a problem
where it wants to S1 and it did S1
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where a lot of that shit came
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where a lot of the cookie
offspring, the cookie hybrid offspring
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where almost 99 percent of it came
from was their S1 packs that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: selling to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that they'll ever have to
kind of face the music for the Candy Rain
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: They just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like they did just now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jigga couldn't sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jigga couldn't sell a pack of seeds right
now if he wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think people pretty much got the hit
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What just happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was like I said, that was
snickle fritz.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to sit here and talk numbers
or anything, but they sold five hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar packs of seeds, a couple thousand
packs of seeds at five hundred dollars a
[SPEAKER_02]: piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do the fucking math and hardly anybody
got good offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the people couldn't even get the
seeds to pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't even pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they did pop, they were growing off
mute and trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like it's just such a snickle
fritz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't even believe that even
happened and that they would even have any
[SPEAKER_02]: body supporting them at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured that'd be a full 100 percent
blacklisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still people that support them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, time wins everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't beat time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Jigga disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jigga and Berner claimed Berner claimed
Jigga's account just got deleted from
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking make a new one and get a shout
out from your boy Berner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have 50,000 followers in fucking
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, you don't want to come face
the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to see what people are
going to say to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to fucking face the reality
that you just stole a couple of million
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars from your customer base.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just like I said, it's never happened
in the history of the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone with such a huge name that was
held in such a high regard by a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, not everybody, but a lot of people
did think that they had good potential to
[SPEAKER_02]: drop good seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was just the absolute worst
seed drop of all time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never has there been a worse seed drop
from anyone, small company or big company,
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that we'll see them again?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hearing whispers in the wings of the
community that JBZ is locked into doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more projects for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, JBZ works with them for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might release stuff under JBZ,
but you'll never see Jigga posting his
[SPEAKER_03]: little homemade colourful packs again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how he made, I mean, if you go,
I mean, you go back and look at how this
[SPEAKER_03]: all happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was all just a huge snickle for its
grab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but you'll never see Jigga talking
about his phenyl hunts and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking F1 race car and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, the videos are just a joke,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the phenyl hunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just so fake, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all so fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Berner's never bred anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Berner doesn't know anything about
breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jigga doesn't know anything about breeding
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm a young breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a ton of shit to learn about
breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally have forgotten more about
breeding cannabis than those two dudes
[SPEAKER_02]: together have ever learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fucking literally know nothing about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a great example is the whole F1 video
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate to go in on these guys right
now, but I just feel like this is this is
[SPEAKER_02]: a perfect time since you asked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a video where they're talking
about what makes cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody who watches it could see right
through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any common sense at all,
you could tell right away what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were around people that said the word
F1 and they didn't know what that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't understand what an F1 was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they said that F1 was F1 race car that
made, as he's stumbling all over his
[SPEAKER_02]: words, because he has no fucking clue what
he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't just tell you what made cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you asked me right now, what made
what made me out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I took raw and I dusted it with the PCS-1
stud.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is raw?
[SPEAKER_02]: Raw is fire OG dusted by Scott's OG male.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's PCS-1?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wi-Fi 3 dusted by Scott's OG dusted by
Casper OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you right now, any project that
I've done, and it takes me two seconds to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody that, if you ask them,
if you ask them an honest question,
[SPEAKER_02]: how'd you make this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're fucking full of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a fucking liar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a liar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sad that we've even come this far
with such an important plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still had people around us like
that, that were just willing to just lie,
[SPEAKER_02]: just willing to steal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm saying if you join this
industry and you just don't lie and steal
[SPEAKER_02]: from people, you'll be in the top 20%
right out the gate because that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's out here doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all just bullshit each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're lying to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like this one big grab to try to get
in each other's pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that, that team and that story,
it will go down in history as the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: money, money snatch in all of cannabis
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hands down, the worst seed offspring of
all time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just had such a huge name and
everybody expected so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, I don't think they'll ever be
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Jay Bezey will cover them,
but Jay Bezey has his own fan base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people will, people will still,
they'll still make money, but they sell,
[SPEAKER_02]: they sell fucking toasters with cookies on
it and backpacks made in Taiwan and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they, they sell everything,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always going to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't about money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about Tegrity and they don't got no
Tegrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you for referencing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly enough, I noticed that
you haven't done as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't done any crosses with Sherbert
or Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever plan to, and as a follow-up,
do you think Shabinsky made the right call
[SPEAKER_00]: by kind of distancing himself from the
cookie fam a while ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know his story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He definitely seems like an outsider to
me, just like a rich dude that just has
[SPEAKER_02]: connections and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He very well may have made those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he did, congratulations,
they've had a huge impact for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of people enjoy him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not my flavor of person.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of what I call, I really feel
like there's two really, there's two
[SPEAKER_02]: really strong personality types that are
in this marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know one of them is what I would call
the regulars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of them is called the
Hollywoods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the regulars are just people selling
fucking dope and selling edibles and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, you know, we're just out here
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the Hollywoods.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are all about the magazines and all
about the interviews and all about the
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures and all about the, let me get my
product in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does he got his fucking weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does he sell his weed in like some fucking
super rich white people store?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like selling weed at a Louis
Vuitton store or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't Louis Vuitton, but I don't
know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his weed in some fucking,
he's like all fancy-pantsy type guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not my style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all those people that he works with
are people that were not cool with weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 10 years ago, five years ago,
even.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a buddy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that he'll ever go
anywhere because he's a hustling
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucker and real hustlers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't, they don't give a fuck about
anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just grind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a ton of respect for him in that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to grind it till the wheels
fall off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have anything to say outside
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he is, he is who he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not personally going to make crosses
with his stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I have plans to at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if something tastes really fire
and it breeds true, I'll use it in my
[SPEAKER_02]: projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have some like fake made up shit
in my head where I'm not going to use your
[SPEAKER_02]: shit because you know, whatever,
like I don't like exactly who you are as a
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking dumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I didn't have any plans on using
any of his stuff, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, dude, he just, he is who he is,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a bunch of people with
different personalities and I have a real
[SPEAKER_02]: strong personality type too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of people that don't like
me, just the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not, I'm not too stressing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way the game goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you ever consider breeding with
gelato or sherbet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it was, if I got something,
if I had a cut and I grew it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the weed was fire and then that cut
bred true, I wouldn't be afraid to use it
[SPEAKER_02]: in projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question, it's not,
it's not a yes or a no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was something that I came across
that tastes fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what anybody's shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good outlook to have in
general, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, just be down with
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I'm just down to grow chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always just been about this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I like to grow chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like good flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to make good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really give a fuck about anything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about the names or the
lineage trees or any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't care, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to get fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my friends to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to get bread and we want to live
out our fucking human lives here on a good
[SPEAKER_02]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of us, we grew up so
fucking poor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is giving us everything that we
never thought we would have, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everything, dude, that we never
thought we could ever, ever touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get because of this fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't put into words how thankful I
am to it, how thankful I am for the people
[SPEAKER_02]: who support PCS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of it is a fucking dream at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just riding it right that way,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you, because I think
you'll be able to answer better than any
[SPEAKER_00]: of my previous guests really could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bit more of a lightweight topic
anyway, which I think will slot in nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried Slash?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinions on that famous Oregon
cut Jaeger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jaeger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got in trouble online the other day
because I said on someone's post,
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was fucking trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those cuts that you
either like it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like licorice turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like it does well outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Oregon has a really rough weather
climate for growing pot outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it tends to be any cut that shows up
that does well outside here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody goes bananas for it because
they're like, yeah, something that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to turn into fucking complete shit
by September.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not oblivious to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an outdoor farmer in Oregon
trying to eat, fucking grow all the anger
[SPEAKER_02]: you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that I would ever use
in my projects or grow inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I can tell a straight is good
or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you grow it inside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you grow it inside for your head
stash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, you're not growing fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeager inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just it's one of those things that
some people like it, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but there's some people that there's
some people that like to get fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: chicks to take shits on them and kick them
in the balls or they can't have an orgasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are fucking weird, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not everybody's the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: If a chick took a shit on me, I'd punch
her in the fucking throat right in her T3
[SPEAKER_03]: vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd snap that bitch's fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your neck would be fucked, lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your neck is fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next place you walk is going to need a
fucking wheelchair ramp because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you get for shitting on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's let's chat about some other
notable Oregon ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had any experience with the J1?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about Blue Magoo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some decent examples of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not not anything to super write home
about, but definitely not as a not as
[SPEAKER_02]: repulsive as Jaeger.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my final little one on my Oregon
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen pink champagne?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've seen the peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got a really cool profile that is
champagne.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you open up a bag of a PC,
that's exactly what you smell is a a soft
[SPEAKER_02]: pink rose champagne smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking so smooth, super cool to
smell something that's like what I that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the word.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use words like exotic for that profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of fruity, but it's not like a
fruit that you're used to smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I absolutely like that straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke a lot of other people's
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, unless I see it in extracts,
I don't I don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have ran across it in my time here
and it is very fucking good for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's grown right, obviously like
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely one of my favorite ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in Oregon where there's actually
quite a good number of notable breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: around the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are some of the ones whose works you
vibe with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used Archive's Casper OG to build out
my stud and to help build out my stud.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of the three pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: He makes a lot of good crosses that a lot
of people enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't grow, like I said, I stopped years
ago, stopped growing other people's seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never grow like any of his new
projects, but he's from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of there's a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man, it's I don't really
grow people's seeds after.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I decided to make the switch when I
first got to really good clothes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I focused heavily on production of my
elite clones and trading and collecting
[SPEAKER_02]: and building my stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just didn't grow a lot of seed
outside of my own seed projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard for me to just sign up for
someone and be like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy is the guy who's doing good up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't like I told you earlier,
I don't pay a lot of attention to other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's projects, how they turn out,
if they're good or bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of just stay in my own lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hyper focused on my own projects and
my own stuff and my own journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much the only way I
could get it all done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just to not give a fuck
about what other people are up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nothing personal at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone brings something to my
attention, I definitely will check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those things that I
decided to do a while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been definitely good for me and
for my energy and my time to not get all
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in everybody's anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just don't just stay fucking
focused on PCS and what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I'll tell you why is because I
spent many years not many years spinning
[SPEAKER_02]: wheels and not focused and not hustling
and being all caught up in everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: drama on here and caught up in my own
drama and like, what the fuck,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck these people like nobody here gives a
shit about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your page is shut down tomorrow,
do you think people are going to lose
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're just going to be gone like a
fart in the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to focus and make sure that
you you take advantage of your
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities and in everybody's life,
you're going to have left and right turns
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can look back at your life right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of you listening and you could go,
man, I went left right there and I should
[SPEAKER_02]: have went right right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody could see a spot where they
went left and they should have went right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to minimize those as much
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: For myself, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, understandable frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've noticed this trend, right,
where it's like, it's not enough for like
[SPEAKER_00]: the meme pages to try to be funny or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they've got to have their own little
canner brand on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a feeling this is kind of what
leads to their inevitable downfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the meme pages in
the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they should just steer clear
of trying to start their own business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our friend Kelly Tubbs Factory?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like people are going to do
whatever we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't care what people do with
their business lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like I'm not too stressed on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like I said earlier, time separates all
of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually time sorts all things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a hundred brands come and go,
you know, over the past five, six years,
[SPEAKER_02]: brands that were so fast out of the gate
that were big talkers and were this and
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're just non-existent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not stressing on it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if somebody wants to make fucking
brand, make the brand like all power to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish everybody well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that most people are doing
it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I feel like I'm just so
comfortable with time because I just know
[SPEAKER_02]: that time works fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not doing it right,
you're not going to you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: stick around very long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really can't count hundreds of
companies that have just come and gone in
[SPEAKER_02]: the last five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why is because they weren't
met for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go on Craigslist right now and find in
any city in the country, you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: guarded equipment for sale, like weed
growing equipment, because this shit ain't
[SPEAKER_02]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of people think they want to come
and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it's not,
you know, it's not the fucking grand
[SPEAKER_02]: vision that they thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit, I actually have to mop floors
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being a grower is actually being a fucking
janitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much feel like a fucking
custodian.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just just a heads up for all your
growers, get a fucking mop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to know the broom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give the broom a name, because you should
be dancing with that bitch every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking crazy how it's a total title
shift in your brain from what you thought
[SPEAKER_02]: you were going to be doing to what you're
actually doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can relate to that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of wrap up this last
little section we've been talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Wright has put forward this joke,
but I reckon it would be great,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we have like a WWF ring at like the
cannabis cups and people can like settle
[SPEAKER_00]: their beef in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you sign up for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: No WWF though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to put some gloves on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me actually smack some of these kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put geese on them and we can actually do
some jujitsu or something, but no WWF.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as I really get to fucking show
them my intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just segued perfectly into the
next question whereby I was going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you think jujitsu plays into the
cannabis lifestyle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we see that they're so heavily
intertwined in their usage among the
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think it's about the both that
draw people to both of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first thing is probably the
healing aspects of cannabis spiritually
[SPEAKER_02]: and mentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really are cleansers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can let a lot of shit go just by
having a good session, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a really good herb session or dab session.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel different when it's done,
if it's done the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people just abuse marijuana and
abuse extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really truly use it as the
medicine that it's been gifted to us as.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jujitsu players I find tend to be
cruisers, like a lot of jujitsu guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: just these like cruiser types,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The surfer mentality, the fucking the
fucking the cruise through life type,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where pot is like it always
finds the cruisers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cruiser drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes food better, makes movies better,
makes sex better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes jujitsu better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes things better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way that it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This way it always be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I thought it was funny that pot
was so fucking outlawed for so long that
[SPEAKER_02]: like they finally realized we're never not
going to smoke this drug like you can keep
[SPEAKER_02]: it illegal forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, we better legalize this
and make money off of it the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, you should probably do
that because we love pot like people love
[SPEAKER_02]: pot and they're always going to love pot
because it's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely not just jujitsu.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the NBA like almost fucking
like easily half the NBA smokes pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: NFL players, a bunch of them would love to
smoke pot for healing their bodies and
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of taking pills and shit like it's
not just jujitsu.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fucking it's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we really dove into it,
we would quickly find out that a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: our school teachers and a bunch of our
bankers and a bunch of like pot is just
[SPEAKER_02]: really pretty fucking prevalent in our in
our society.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those things that was
kind of not talked about as much and
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol was really promoted and people
were kind of just quiet about it about the
[SPEAKER_02]: pot part, but they were definitely doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of touched on how there are
some sports where the players would
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from being able to use it,
but currently aren't allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think will be some of the
first sports to open it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think UFC might be one of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the UFC, the NFL and the NBA,
I can all see in the next few years just
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing as the federal governments
leading back in different states are
[SPEAKER_02]: leading back into legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's only a matter of time,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never thought that we would see this
when we were kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you told me, hey, man, one day you'll
be able to just walk in stores by pot and
[SPEAKER_02]: walk two blocks at the street and walk in
a different store by pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, you're fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it's changing pretty crazy how fast
it's changing, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we're going to see anything
but progression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's part of progression is releasing
people from its clutches of illegality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fucked if you have a job and
you still have to piss in a cup and all
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to do is smoke a little bit of
pot and you can't because you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to lose your fucking job that pays you
$75,000 a year because God forbid,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you had to go make $60,000 a year,
it's like you're already struggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like they've got everybody
by the balls, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole fucking this whole story that
how it's getting played out is fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's kind of ludicrous in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you touched on how, you know,
things are always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's segue back into some strain
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are always changing, especially
kind of the hottest strain of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is going to be the next
big flavor profile to take over the scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to toot my own horn, but my PCS2
crosses are really going to to light up
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020 with the chem and the OG profiles
coming through in a hybrid offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everyone's going to find basically OG
chem, chem OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're going to find profiles that
are the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, karma's sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: His projects, I'm sure he's going to do
some more sour stuff, but everybody's been
[SPEAKER_02]: loving his sour projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen so many people post about his
sour projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure karma, karma and the boys will
come out with something dope for 2020 with
[SPEAKER_02]: that sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some cross or maybe maybe just do some
more line work on what they already have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know a bunch of people have fallen
in love with that ship.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You beat me to my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I was going to say that I can see
that you've started to make some new
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses with the PCS2 mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about how that one's
a bit different from the number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was its Genesis story?
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, I just took my PCS1 mail and
I dusted probably 30 different cuts,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 different cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was just looking for, you know,
good seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a bunch of those crosses,
but one of the first ones I went through
[SPEAKER_02]: was the Kev4 that was dusted by the PCS1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what made me decide to use
that was the female offspring that we
[SPEAKER_02]: found.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we planted a bunch of those seeds and
flowered out 80 or 90 females and a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of them were just fucking Kev and OG
hybrid fungi power.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to use that same seed stock
to select a male from knowing that that
[SPEAKER_02]: profile is getting pushed through in that
seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't necessarily mean that it's
going to come through on said mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we started checking the PCS2
offspring right away, that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: we saw was anything that was gas that got
touched was fucking just it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: pouring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like pouring gas on a campfire
pretty much like that's all we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We added girth to a bunch of stuff with
the Kev4 and you can smell and taste the
[SPEAKER_02]: Kev4 and a bunch of it, especially the OG
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cookie crosses tended to take it a
little less, but you could still smell it
[SPEAKER_02]: come through like it's still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely prevalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are really going to fucking
enjoy the only reason I haven't released
[SPEAKER_02]: them to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've let people get at them in my auction,
but I've only released them at auction and
[SPEAKER_02]: not to market because I personally want to
do my big fetal hunts before they go to
[SPEAKER_02]: market market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've just been waiting for this
facility to get finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have room to do my big hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at all of the different PCS2
crosses you have planned, which one are
[SPEAKER_00]: you most excited for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of the first release with the
number one male, what out of those was the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that you kind of just decided you'd
like the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of PCS1, the best thing that we
found that I think that I think I like the
[SPEAKER_02]: most is definitely the Meow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Scots OG cut that I have that I built
all that stuff with is so fucking dank and
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes through in a lot of stuff and it
definitely comes through in that cross,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it just has a different vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super chunky and Meow has just been
so consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every 15 pack, you know, every 15
seeds per, you know, one pack of seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a fucking bomb keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like, everybody finds a keeper in
that cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I absolutely love the Meow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done a lot of people solid and it's
done me really solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some fucking power keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PCS2, I'm pretty stoked about Congo,
which is the Zukis dusted by PCS2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm 90% sure one of the biggest
strains of the year is going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: Champawat, which is the raw dusted by
PCS2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just, like I said, we've popped
the seed, we found offspring that we like,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't want to say this is it until I
do the 200, 300 seeds per and I'm about to
[SPEAKER_02]: have room to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just figured out, I would wait to
sell the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have a bunch of the seed ready to put
to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just wait to sell the seed until I
did my hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as a quick follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just said it was the raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: So raw is fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire cut that I got for Rascals Crew
dusted by a Scotso G male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I did the big Scotso G Fetal
hunt, when I found that Scotso G Fetal,
[SPEAKER_02]: Scotso G male, I found like six males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up flowering three of them and
killing two of those three before they
[SPEAKER_02]: ever dropped pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of wanted to see how they were
building their flower sets out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up flowering one of those
Scotso G males and I dusted everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the time I had maybe like seven
cuts, 70 lead cuts, and I made a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: side project stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just one of them that I
decided to plant and look through the fire
[SPEAKER_02]: cut dusted by that Scotso G male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found hands down, one of the
nastiest OG Ibrin cuts that I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking smoked or seen in my life,
the raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I named it raw because it's
just raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so gassy and everybody who fucks with
it loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just super dang, super enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rawest of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rawest of the raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think it's important that
breeders should be trying to hunt their
[SPEAKER_00]: own females?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed it's a trend that there are
some breeders who the females they're
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing stuff to, it's just the clone
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never see any of like their own
strains getting crossed to a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's an important thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you would be looking at for
real line work for people to start doing
[SPEAKER_02]: their own lines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like myself, I haven't dusted anything
that's not I mean, maybe that raw cut,
[SPEAKER_02]: but most everything I've dusted has been
me dusting, cloned all the elites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why is because I just am
brand new at breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as we get a little further down
in the journey, there's definitely going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be different lines made and line work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really nothing I could do at this
point without the space that I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as I get the space, I'll be able
to expand into those projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But without a doubt, it's imperative.
[SPEAKER_02]: As to be a breeder, to truly be doing your
own line work and selecting and building
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from inside your own projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the idea of like a
standardized seed pricing system where
[SPEAKER_00]: like if it's like an F1 and the two
parent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even need to fit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me more.
[SPEAKER_03]: A standardized pricing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, we're all different,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people's projects are just
complete dog shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have no depth and they don't have any
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want right now, everybody who's
listening, think of your favorite breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you have them in your head,
I want you to think of all the strains
[SPEAKER_02]: they've released in the last five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I want you to think about all the
people that, you know, that still grow any
[SPEAKER_02]: of the stuff that they released over the
last five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to understand that a bunch
of that seed that was sold had no
[SPEAKER_02]: offspring that was keepable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just seed that was sold to you as a
customer because it had a name and you
[SPEAKER_02]: thought it might be good and it might
render something good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But did it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many strains have we heard of in the
last five years from all of us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm a brand new breeder,
but I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put everybody's name into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of them are where are the keeper
keepers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, dude, I've seen so many menus come
with nothing to be heard of from the menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that all of our projects are
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think standardizing prices on how,
where things are on a tree would make any
[SPEAKER_02]: sense at all.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of all the breeders currently out
there, how many of them do you think are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually doing like a good job in terms of
what they should be doing and delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: to market, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 20% again, two out of 10,
two out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's right now currently people making
seed for the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's maybe 300, 250 to 300 people
making seed for the marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and maybe one out of 10, two out of
10, 10% probably is a better estimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% literally there's about 20 or 30 guys
that you could fucking trust that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, we're going to deliver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a short list, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, if you put billions of
dollars on the table, every Wolf,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the same as if you put a dead body on
the Sahara, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every wild dog, every coyote, every
fucking thing is going to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vultures, the, the everything,
the lions, they all show up because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're dealing with here is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a budding industry and a bunch
of people showing up to, to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: get their due.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they think is their due at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're kind of in the midst of
the, the corporate cannabis takeover in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see things going on the big
ag level?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as far as growing smokeable good
product, never they'll never compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't always end up just an extract
form, whatever they're doing, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: they're freezing it or just drying it and
making fucking crude or whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really, I don't stress on them at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've never, I've never been worried
about anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what bothers me about big ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: What bothers me about them is their
potential to control law, their potential
[SPEAKER_02]: to control my human existence because they
are afraid of the little guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always consistently show they are big
industry knocks around little industry to
[SPEAKER_02]: make, you know, all the profits available
to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Walmart does.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what everybody does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just worry about all the smaller farmers
that mom and pops are going to be turned
[SPEAKER_02]: into a straight legitimate outlaws again,
because they want to grow some pop for
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe sell a couple of ounces to their
people or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not going to be an option
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's the whiskey tax all over
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just living in some fucking
alternate reality where the government
[SPEAKER_02]: shows up and just says, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like fucking why I'm not doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are fucking liars and thieves and
killers and you guys fucking kill kids
[SPEAKER_03]: with drones and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't grow a plant like,
dude, we're living fucking some weird
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wild times kind of Twilight Zone
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were you around when the forums were
really big?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was, but I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use, I never used a computer or
got on the forums at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never a forum guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I think you can still have a
pretty good input on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think people reminisce so much
about the forums, even though the general,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, knowledge of the cannabis community is
much greater now than what it used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: back then?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think because they had it, it was a
little tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little more tight knit and,
uh, pretty much everybody kind of do
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody on whatever forum you were on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody, it was just much more
tight knit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of outsiders now and it's
just saturated with just fucking idiots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was one forum, I can't remember
if it was ICMAG, which you couldn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: comment at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you had to join and be a member for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you could say anything and then you
had to like message people and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: had to message you back or something like
six times before you could comment or some
[SPEAKER_02]: weird shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was ICMAG, but one of
them was pretty serious about just letting
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to work for it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably kept some of the people out,
but definitely I think it's just a,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit of a more tight knit
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no biggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the rise of the vape
cartridges and everything that's followed
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, it's just dog shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't have any, they're just
trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just quick way to make a buck,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: People turning all kinds of garbage
harvest into processable money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never ever see anybody put really
good flour into anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always just dog shit that they're
trying to make money off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen it be anything else other
than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, it's one of those things
that sucks, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be some tips you would offer
for someone who's thinking about getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into breeding, but just doesn't really
know how and just what would be your kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of advice about how they could get things
started?
[SPEAKER_02]: First things first, shut off what
everybody's going to say to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause people are going to tell you that,
you know, you don't need to do it or it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not for you or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fucking listen to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to breed, make sure you have a
nice, decent selection to start with,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a stable, build out a little bit of a
stable and just start to make sure you're
[SPEAKER_02]: reading and understanding the basic
concepts of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not all over the fucking place
and don't overthink it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make some cool new crosses to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get good at it, maybe people
will enjoy your stuff enough to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy it and you can fucking sell seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not, you'll always have your own
seed stock of stuff you like, or backup
[SPEAKER_02]: seed stock in case the fucking world goes
fucking D-Day shit and you actually have
[SPEAKER_02]: some seed for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, I don't know, don't stress
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let anybody fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let anybody dictate your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you have a nice little stable to
start with and fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how important do you think it is for
people to have a social media these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're looking to be like a breeder,
for example, or an influencer?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the market, is it critical?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to be able to sell
anything if you don't have social media,
[SPEAKER_02]: like nobody sells shit unless they have
actual storefront space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they have to have social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where our community is,
is on Instagram and social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've noticed you've got quite an
impressive following yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be some tips for people who are
kind of struggling to get their follow
[SPEAKER_00]: account to where they want it to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram's algorithm is pretty much junk
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's busted up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know anymore about Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I did back in the day before it
was bought by Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg
[SPEAKER_02]: told his shenanigans was just post good
pictures regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you stay interactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Post a picture in the morning and a
picture at night so you get two different
[SPEAKER_02]: audiences, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, sometimes the same group of people
on both pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people are on their phones in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are only on their phones at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you post once in the AM and once in the
PM, you have a good chance of people
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing one of the posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you're interacting with people
and don't be a fucking asshole,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally built my whole thing by just
being me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just interacting with people, helping
fucking countless growers with simple
[SPEAKER_02]: questions that a lot of other growers
didn't want to answer, giving myself to
[SPEAKER_02]: the community for years, like just being
available and helping people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that's for everybody,
but it's definitely for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't be afraid if you want to get,
get your, get your foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like I said, don't be a piece of
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start interacting and start doing
what you're doing and your account will go
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming if you, if you're not being a
fuckhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your opinion, what do you think will
go down as the notable cut from the 2015
[SPEAKER_00]: to the 2020 period?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the reason why it's a very specific
question like that is because I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty undeniable 2010 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really the cookies era.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is the last five years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody's different,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got their own, everybody's got
their own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really feel like there's been good
projects from a bunch of different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's just, I can't get away from
the same stuff that I fuck with is just
[SPEAKER_02]: OGs and kebs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never, they never go old to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's definitely going to be always
new projects and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are going to be making all
types of stuff that I just don't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in at all, but a bunch of people
like, so, you know, I mean, CSI has made
[SPEAKER_02]: some really cool stuff, some really cool
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally did, like I said earlier,
you know, it's just one of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: where I don't smoke a lot of other
people's pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pay much attention to what other
people are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stay super focused in my own little
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people take that the
wrong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think that I'm like ego or that I
like, don't give them good energy or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm like hyper focused on my own
shit, but it's the only way to get out of
[SPEAKER_02]: such a hole that I was in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people don't realize I came to Oregon
with $800.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we spent 650 on our first month's
rent and by the three weeks in,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had no money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we, we barely made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything I have, I got from nothing
from zilch dude, from starting from zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized quickly, I could get more
for my family and do better for my tribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I just don't pay attention to everybody
else's shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, dude, I can't look my kids in
the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing I just wasted fucking hours of my
life arguing with some random kid on the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's why I said, I just won't,
we won't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to pull up and scrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really have a fucking problem,
we're going to scrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, then I'm not going to give a fuck
about what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it straight to the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that brings us to our last
couple of quick fire questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more yes, no type of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one, what is the best bud you've
ever smoked in your life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Either the Crippler here in Oregon that
was gifted to me years ago and I lost the
[SPEAKER_02]: cut cause I'm fucking stupid and I don't
know the guy who gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a total random event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the pure real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush that I smoked the very first time
that I smoked OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still to this day is one of the
purest cuts I've ever come across and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was so fucking smooth and amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the flip side, what's the worst weed
you've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely that, that Mexi,
the Mexi brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten weed from, from Mexico that
is still smelled like gasoline that was
[SPEAKER_02]: smuggled in, in the gas tank and the
fucking packs were leaking and they
[SPEAKER_02]: actually got gasoline into them and weed
is like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sucks everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've definitely gotten gasoline,
dirt weed growing up as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the worst fucking weed I've ever
smoked for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new benchmark you set there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ask anybody, anybody from Southern
California will be like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely forgot that we smoked dirt
weed that actually smelled like gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big gas boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the passion comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've certainly smoked my fair share
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have smoked fucking Aboriginal
dog shit weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riddled with PGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me put a spin on that one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the worst strain you've smoked,
which commercially kind of took off a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and people, some people thought it was
good, but you were like, nah, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: trash.
Jaeger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaeger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue dream.
Jaeger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those are the Jaegers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one that really pops off coming
from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just a lot of people that were
really liked it and were hyped on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I really think it was just cause it
finished early and it wasn't, it was
[SPEAKER_02]: something that would get out on the
outdoor, you know, without getting rotten.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're on a desert Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only take three cuts with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be pretty easy for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking a chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking a fucking pure TK, like the
real deal TK, chem four and a real deal
[SPEAKER_03]: sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tree piece, maybe with some sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a cut that you've either lost
over the years or never quite got access
[SPEAKER_00]: to that you'd love to get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you mentioned the cripple
before, so it's got to be something other
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bay 11, I grew out some seeds one time and
I found a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a plant Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, for some reason, didn't like those
structure of the plant and I just didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: clone it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very specifically looking for
certain structures and it was easily one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the top five best tasting pots I've
ever smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just tried to revenge it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was devastating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've all had similar experiences
like that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was still to this day,
still bothers me a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the most piece of my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto our final question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go back in time, any place,
anywhere, where would you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: When and what seeds are you collecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could go back to any place in time,
anywhere, surprisingly, I wouldn't go that
[SPEAKER_02]: far back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wouldn't be there to collect weed
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had the trigger and I could just go
any place in time, I would go sit down and
[SPEAKER_02]: have dinner with my grandmother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would make her, I would make her a nice
tri-tip and salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just enjoy her company and her
conversation for the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was my absolute best friend in
which she had me, I didn't quite have my
[SPEAKER_02]: head on straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was all over the place and I didn't
get to fully enjoy her energy,
[SPEAKER_02]: how cool of a lady she was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I readily always, that's the first
thing that pops into my head when someone
[SPEAKER_02]: asks me that if you could go to any place
at any time, it's always, I just crave to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear her voice, to enjoy her company one
more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, all you guys listening, just
understand a couple of things about this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a dogfight out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people trying to get in
your pockets and trying to do shady stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a dollar for every time I heard
someone talk about somebody else ripping
[SPEAKER_02]: them off, I wouldn't fucking need any
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way it works out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be very aware, keep your head on a
swivel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be kind to your employees and to your
people that you work with so that way they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't feel the need to go anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys can build together,
be kind, kindness, kindness, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: be gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the other bullshit doesn't mean
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're, we're going to be in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be in and out of these
lives really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to be remembered by your
people, how you were with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just be aware of how you are as a
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get into the weed,
industry, do it from a good spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't come here just for money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have a little bit of love for
this plant and she'll feed you forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely, lovely.
