[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm really honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been a big fan of the show for a
long time So this is cool as fuck Man
[SPEAKER_00]: likewise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful that you're joining me here
and that that's cool that you've been a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of the show the question I love to ask
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm smoking Holy Communion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was gifted to me by a grower who
found it, you know I was at an event and
[SPEAKER_01]: they brought me back a sample Gave it to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm smoking now cool So I mean what
what are the genetics behind that one and
[SPEAKER_00]: like how would you describe the flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so Holy Communion is our PC3
cross with the Harlem dreams So both of
[SPEAKER_01]: those strains were bred by us PC3 is our
pif s2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an inbred pif line We're going for
faster flowering each generation s2 is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of where we ended that one and Then
the Harlem dreams is the Cuban black haze
[SPEAKER_01]: cross with blue dream Now that one just
kind of added the bag appeal so crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: the You know our our pretty haze to our
fast haze is is the Holy Communion,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know That's like our joining of our
two biggest His close staple strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Man, that's epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's I want to ask questions about
pretty much all those strains as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of other stuff I guess maybe the
first thing to start off with is a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: like Background because for so many people
including myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never had pif or like sort of the
the pif associated genetics That have you
[SPEAKER_00]: know in the parentage?
[SPEAKER_00]: What how would you describe the pifs
effect and smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is it about it that's developed
such a cult following?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the pif as far as effects
though I would say it's like an all-around
[SPEAKER_01]: weed you can use it depending on the
dosage You can use it for many things if I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke smaller joints I can smoke them
throughout the day and still be uplifted
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I want to smoke a lot at night,
I'll smoke, you know A little bit more and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be more out of it, you know So it can
go different ways and it's different for
[SPEAKER_01]: every person, of course, but it's usually
known for an uplifting high You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a sativa though but um the smell I
would call it like incense or cat piss or
[SPEAKER_01]: Basement Grandma's purse, you know,
there's so many descriptions that people
[SPEAKER_01]: have come up with like mop water or it's a
very very distinct smell and I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: cult following thing is Because it was
really produced on a large scale on the
[SPEAKER_01]: East Coast You know during the 90s in the
2000s So a lot of people were smoking this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know So and at that time not a
lot of good weed was readily available
[SPEAKER_01]: like it is now you know at that time you
had like the Mexican brick weed you had
[SPEAKER_01]: the Arizona which is A little better than
the brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like uncompressed And then and I
had like your droves and your sour diesels
[SPEAKER_01]: and your hazes, you know Your white widows
and your ties and stuff like that But at
[SPEAKER_01]: that time, you know, it was really hard to
find good weed like that And haze was just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the best one Yeah epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean so many follow-ups to go there I
guess why don't you give us a bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: backstory on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in terms of what I've read and
been told, you know Cuban black haze It's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the many many phenotypes of nl5
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when did it first pop up and is there
just one phenotype of it or was there
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's many different
stories I'm a bit on the younger side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't there when it originated,
you know But from what I've heard that it
[SPEAKER_01]: is an nl5 haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an nl5 haze a to be more specific
Because the C side is more that's our
[SPEAKER_01]: paneling dominant side, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the haze a cross with the nl5
you know, they say that some Cubans went
[SPEAKER_01]: to Amsterdam and brought back the seeds
and Three Finos were kept Cuban black haze
[SPEAKER_01]: with one of them the other two died This
is the only one that really lived,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but um Yeah So there's uh,
there's a lot of stories behind it and but
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know it's been in the community since
so 89 is like when the seeds were first
[SPEAKER_01]: made and then 92 is when they were
released Wow, yeah a long time So I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to quickly touch on something you
mentioned there which is the distinction
[SPEAKER_00]: between the nl5 haze a versus the C and As
you'd be well aware There's quite a vocal
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of population within the community
who have quite a feverish amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenaline hate I'd love to hear what's
your thoughts on the terpenaline hate
[SPEAKER_00]: subject?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in that camp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not not to like for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, I don't mind it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say no to Jack Terps, man So listen,
you know, here's my thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was first started growing I was You
know smoking haze is my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started growing and I ordered haze
seeds online But when I got all those haze
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and started growing them out,
it was Jack Terps after Jack Terps after
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Terps So it's kind of tough,
you know, like when you're used to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain thing And then when you start,
you know, if you go anywhere else in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world rather than like the East Coast of
the United States He's being terpenaline
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you come here haze is a
completely different Experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's mercy and dominant So,
you know Jack is kind of taking over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's why people hate on it You
know, we still grow it for the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: love it You know, I can't hate too hard
But I can't say that I wasn't disappointed
[SPEAKER_01]: every time I got to week two of Flower and
the shit was Jack Terps again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so that's kind of what set me
off on that Totally totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'd love to hear a bit more
about sort of just the differences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast culture versus the West Coast
because so much of what sort of goes
[SPEAKER_00]: around online and what is in the the
popular opinion often relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: California often a lot of the historical
trends in California dominance Where as as
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've just you know alluded to even
just within the realm of haze as they were
[SPEAKER_00]: very different So, you know, what was what
role did pif play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, you know, was it always
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it something that was like kind of
hard to get and you had to be ahead and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was you know Was it hard to get and what
was the other stuff that was it going
[SPEAKER_00]: around as you were growing up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean you had to be in the hood to
get the haze really or you had to know
[SPEAKER_01]: some Cubans or Dominicans or somebody in
the Spanish culture Really to get if you
[SPEAKER_01]: really wanted to get the haze or you had
to go straight to the hood to get it right
[SPEAKER_01]: off the block You know, it wasn't
something that like normally like the all
[SPEAKER_01]: the white people around were messing with
the sour diesel and the Canadian Beasters
[SPEAKER_01]: or dro they call it or other exotics but
haze was strictly always with the Cubans
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what so you really did need like
To connect to really be able to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff You know, but when you did people
would pay a lot a lot a lot for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like $600 an ounce back then
Yeah, wow, okay and then I guess like the
[SPEAKER_00]: the question I have is was it Was it
obvious?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it was obvious to everyone
who got it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How special it was or do you think like
maybe it was a little bit taken for
[SPEAKER_00]: granted because I feel like there was this
period where everyone was talking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: and It wasn't really around that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say this time frame was about 2015
2014 15 and then thankfully it popped back
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you know and people realized it was
still out there Do you think like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated or it's just been super
tightly held and that's all It's really
[SPEAKER_01]: truly been super tightly held I mean,
it's a little bit looser in the Spanish
[SPEAKER_01]: community Like I know a lot of people that
have the clone that are just like yes
[SPEAKER_01]: haze, you know They don't know nothing of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outside of those circles like they
really it's really not wasn't out there
[SPEAKER_01]: too much, you know So that's that's what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's normal for me, but it's not
normal for everyone and like I was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually part of those people on the on
the forums back then like searching for
[SPEAKER_01]: this haze and it brought me you know here
and I met a bunch of great people and got
[SPEAKER_00]: linked up and it's been You know Yeah,
totally and look I'm super keen to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: your backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I feel like we should go back to
the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do I just want to ask one
quick question were you Getting access to
[SPEAKER_00]: any chem or sour or were you really sort
of just sticking to that Cuban haze lane?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, I always loved the haze I
always picked haze over sour, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely got sour I don't know too much
about maybe not I never heard the name
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog from the streets But I did hear
it once I became a grower, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty early in my life at the same time
You know, so um Yeah, I definitely got
[SPEAKER_01]: sour back in the day and it was definitely
everything people say it was and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing for sure That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to loop back and talk about
some of your sour work But first as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, let's go back to the start and
frame this chat a bit more So what was
[SPEAKER_00]: your very first experience with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: My first experience with cannabis man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was at my friend's James's house I
was 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: My sister had some haze and at the time we
were we were like stealing cigarettes and
[SPEAKER_01]: cigars and smoking whatever we could,
you know, and We had a swisher sweet wood
[SPEAKER_01]: tip and we pencil packed that shit with
haze It's too long and smoked in his
[SPEAKER_01]: garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was throwing up But I loved it man,
you know right after that I went and got
[SPEAKER_01]: some more haze, you know and started I
found somebody with ten dollars I went and
[SPEAKER_01]: bought a dime You know and there were 20
and you know bought two times and just
[SPEAKER_01]: kept going like that ever since that day
Wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so did you get access to indica pretty
early on or did it take some time before
[SPEAKER_01]: you were like Oh, there's this other side
of the spectrum Well, um generally like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was either like haze or mexican brick lead
Which is also a sativa too, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I would rarely see indica's I would
see white widow sometimes I want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: many indica's, you know, it's really like
weed Mids which is also a mexican sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: or you know, and then we had the drow I
guess that was an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drill was like the canadian m39 You
know that came up through the new york
[SPEAKER_01]: indian reservations It came down to us and
that stuff was like super dense and it
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled like arizona ice Tea and it had
like orange hairs, you know, if you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people got exposure to uh,
beasters at one point or another What was
[SPEAKER_00]: your progression from sort of that early
years through to say having your first
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know from that moment like I said
I started selling you know just to afford
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke it, you know I'd find somebody to
buy something So I could get something You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, um a couple years later one of my
friends that lived up the street grew some
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in his backyard and He ended up
with a qp and I was like, oh man Got a
[SPEAKER_01]: free qp from that and the very next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I popped some seeds You know, my mom
killed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 16 at the first, you know at the
first time but After a few seasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, she let me keep them and then I
built a little indoor my first indoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: Was in a little pc box.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's where I started the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized, you know, surely that that
wouldn't be big enough so I Sectioned off
[SPEAKER_01]: a little piece of my closet then I got
tents, you know, and I just kept going
[SPEAKER_00]: from there Wow, I love it and I always
love asking people describe to me your
[SPEAKER_00]: first Setup, you know, like what what sort
of gear were you rocking?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all can be honest with
ourselves and have a laugh when we look
[SPEAKER_01]: back It was uh, it was a little CFL inside
of a computer pc box With space blankets
[SPEAKER_01]: taped to the inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this light shining out of it crazy
You know and my mom will come to my room
[SPEAKER_01]: and think what that why is that thing
shining so much?
[SPEAKER_01]: But she never knew You know eventually but
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of almost like the the
phototron, you know Yeah So do those those
[SPEAKER_00]: first grows was it was it just bag seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any sort of guesses on
reflection what the genetics might have
[SPEAKER_00]: been?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like my first first grows were bag
seeds, but then I started ordering from
[SPEAKER_01]: attitude seed bank actually and yeah,
so my first order was uh Haze it was super
[SPEAKER_01]: silver haze super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one of those greenhouse seeds packs
You know, I got I had a bunch of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff at the time But all that stuff ended
up being jacked herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of was disappointed with the
haze stuff, you know Yeah, but I grew some
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool stuff back then Yeah,
totally there was a heap of breeders who
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be on attitude who are kind of
like defunct or like no longer creating
[SPEAKER_00]: work and really unique stuff and then I
think like sort of around year 2012 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 it just Started to homogenize a bit,
but that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were getting some of that early
stuff Was there anything cool you got that
[SPEAKER_00]: really stands out to you in your memory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I still have it to this day like
some of the first seeds that I ordered was
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Nirvana super stunk and there's
one seed in the That's the biggest seed
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever seen in my life and I just still
keep it but I should pop it, you know This
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is huge though It's ridiculous
That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little coconut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's like the size of a peanut almost
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big it is Never seen anything like it
That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay So sort of how would you describe
your development from that point because
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like you're sort of cutting your
teeth How would you how did you sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: get access to the Cuban haze at first?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I got at that point I was on
the forums, you know, I got on all the
[SPEAKER_01]: forums roll it up THC farmer I see Bag
seed bay, you know, the seed depot is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably one of my favorite ones back then
I started trading clones with people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I got Cookies early on I got the
gorilla glues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you know a bunch of cool stuff I was
growing outside as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like after a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started running gorilla and in the woods
And you know, we were growing some big-ass
[SPEAKER_01]: plants out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing some seeds men white widows
I had a keeper, you know, that was my
[SPEAKER_01]: really good performing plan out there You
know Yeah, so it went from that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the haze it was just you know by
meeting people This guy my boy his name is
[SPEAKER_01]: nugget.
[SPEAKER_01]: He uh, he had a link with the cubans and
he uh Had the cuban black haze clone and
[SPEAKER_01]: he gave it to me, man And you know,
I started right away working with that and
[SPEAKER_01]: then from that I got attention from the
cubans, you know And I got to meet that
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of Dominicans as well and a lot
of people that have Really been this haze
[SPEAKER_01]: for the last 30 years man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those guys have given me
clones and you know, so it's not only that
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the black haze now I have like the
The green haze the golden haze the brown
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different ones,
you know that these different crews have
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're not all necessarily the same,
you know, I think it all derives maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: from the black haze originally But um,
yeah There are different cuts Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, totally that must be like,
you know sort of uh, what a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: progression to go from like Smoking this
thing to getting access to meeting the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to quickly hear, you know I
there's so many different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure people are a little A bit unsure
of what's what just like i've been at
[SPEAKER_00]: times like so I guess I've got two
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is Is cuban black haze the
pif the church haze is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the new york haze is that all the
same thing and then as a follow-up What's
[SPEAKER_00]: the differences between the other ones
like you just mentioned the green haze and
[SPEAKER_00]: some other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe those other ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, if you're looking for that pif cuban
black haze is the one You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, there's no mistaking it So the green
haze is just it grows a little more green
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a little more sharp on the church
kind of smell brown haze Actually turns
[SPEAKER_01]: brown and it has like a damp kind of
Basement smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the golden haze is 120 day plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the longest flowering one That one
turns golden and kind of velvety at the
[SPEAKER_01]: finish, you know, but it's just a really
long time to flower it So but the cuban
[SPEAKER_01]: black haze is you know 90 days that's the
that's the pif that most of the cubans run
[SPEAKER_01]: You know any of these are just little
offshoots that were either bagged seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: You know stuff like that, but It's funny
because I was talking to to a Dominican
[SPEAKER_01]: dudes shout out ed farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a he has a pif cut and um,
I was asking him like yo, where'd you get
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me he said he showed me he's
like it was a round pack with the seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: it And I was like, oh, there's no way
because it has to be greenhouse seeds And
[SPEAKER_01]: it turns out that one of his cuts is from
greenhouse seeds and it was a super silver
[SPEAKER_01]: haze from like 2001 So, you know That's
crazy to hear but it's that's what is
[SPEAKER_01]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he says and you know,
it can't be false because You don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: see those round packs like that,
you know, he would there's no way he could
[SPEAKER_01]: be making that up So, you know,
that's that's one of the stories that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard too Yeah, wow, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so So what he's saying is like he
got something like really really haze
[SPEAKER_01]: leaning out of that super silver haze pack
Yeah, yeah, and it's it smells like pif,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know But yeah, super silver haze So
and you know, this was just sold as haze
[SPEAKER_01]: on the streets in Washington Heights like
no one ever knew the difference So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just you know Totally totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that makes sense I mean like,
you know, even if you do have certain
[SPEAKER_00]: skepticisms about greenhouse and whatnot
It makes sense that a super silver haze
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of haze genetics in it You
know, maybe that's just the one in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred one in a thousand That's like a
really good throwback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you know, that sounds totally
right Reasonable to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I would love to ask because a lot
of this like I've heard stuff over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years But it's just all sort of so
ambiguous to me But I think I was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: to Bodhi a while ago and he was saying
that there's like the original Cuban black
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes and then there's also like an s1 and
the s1 like looks a bit better and It's
[SPEAKER_00]: more aesthetic essentially Do you know
have I confused that is have you heard
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a bit more about that There is a
pif s1 the pif s1 originally came out of
[SPEAKER_01]: mass genetics You know grow so It was just
a bag seed out of his grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the haze was the only thing there from
what I know So we all we all just say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: an s1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality it is a bag seed You know,
but um, yeah, it's a shorter flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 75 80 days It's got that golden
haze look And Yeah, it's really got that
[SPEAKER_01]: piffy smell doc.
[SPEAKER_01]: D is bred with it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept that line going You know made the
the s2s out of that and did a big
[SPEAKER_01]: selection for my for my pif s2 cut You
know, so that's where that one comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you just you just answered the next
question for me But I'll just make sure so
[SPEAKER_00]: so you saying that you use that pif s1 and
the original cut to make your s2 line So
[SPEAKER_01]: it's only bred so it's the pif s1 bred to
itself to make an s2, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see now I see so are those basically the
two cuts that go around predominantly the
[SPEAKER_01]: original and then that s1 Yeah,
and the brown haze is out there pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: well, too You know the autobahn gold that
was given out by stony man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace He was a really good dude So
he he's the one who gave out the golden
[SPEAKER_01]: haze cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really shared too much And then
you know, the green haze isn't really out
[SPEAKER_01]: there as much either And shout out to the
og and the Bronx Mike for the better Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean shout out to all those guys I had
no idea there was all these cool variants
[SPEAKER_00]: that had essentially just been You know
spurred into existence by people who just
[SPEAKER_00]: love haze so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay look heaps of Follow-up questions,
you know the first one about the s2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question I did want to ask you
because you've bred with so much haze is
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel it is possible to?
[SPEAKER_00]: encapsulate that like You know hundred day
plus sort of feeling into a more
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially Manageable offering or do you
think like look you can get most of it
[SPEAKER_00]: there But I don't know if it'll ever be
possible to really you know offer the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing In like a nine week sort of package
All right, so that's a good question and I
[SPEAKER_01]: do believe you can get it most of the way,
you know because We're finding out about
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage effects coming from terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can still isolate those same
terpenes You know in a shorter flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to say that it shouldn't
have the same effect You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will say that with the longer
flowering hazes they go through more
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles, right so it'll shoot its first set
of hairs and those will all be mature and
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll shoot another set of and then
those will get mature by that time those
[SPEAKER_01]: first strike homes are pretty oxidized So
you're getting a little more full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: on the longer flowering stuff Yeah,
wow, it's almost like a mixed grade of
[SPEAKER_00]: heads in a sense Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the big difference that
sets it apart But if we're going off the
[SPEAKER_01]: science, you know base aspect of it Then I
say that we can isolate those same
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and we should be able to get
close to around the same effects give or
[SPEAKER_00]: take Sure, so I want to talk about some of
your breeding in a moment But I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: before we talk about the actual breeding
in the the projects itself Tell me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about what was your sort of
transition from being a grower with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut to thinking You know, I want to start
working with the genetics Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I I bred pretty early on in my
growing area It was an accident but a male
[SPEAKER_01]: went loose in the woods on my gorilla grow
and I got a bunch of seeds and then I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds the next year and You know,
it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always kind of had that had that uh,
you know goal and I always looked up to
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders and thought it was cool and You
know, once I finally got the piss What I
[SPEAKER_01]: was even selling seeds before that Well,
yeah, I really took it up a notch and
[SPEAKER_01]: started Offering more, you know,
and then um, yeah, it went well I Love
[SPEAKER_00]: that The the first seeds was maybe a
little bit unintentional That's I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the same for a lot of us Tell me
about what some of the genetics you were
[SPEAKER_00]: originally crossing together Maybe when
you first started, you know, it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the more planned work What was some
of the stuff you worked with and any
[SPEAKER_00]: notable stuff like that went ahead or that
didn't go ahead?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny man, because my first
intentional like serious breeding project
[SPEAKER_01]: Was from seeds that bode sent to me man
back in like 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh when he when he first got the Cuban
black haze cut You know, I was searching
[SPEAKER_01]: for it back then I emailed him told him
how much I wanted it and he sent me some
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuban black haze nl5 seeds So my first
like real serious breeding project was
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know, I found a male mare I have
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit a lung candy I had The south a sour
Nevada I had at the time sour Nevada was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a chem 91 sour diesel from
reservation labs on us the seed depot I
[SPEAKER_01]: had a bunch of cool stuff that I had and
You know that was kind of like my first
[SPEAKER_01]: big like, you know, I got to preserve
these I ended up reversing that male with
[SPEAKER_01]: florelle and I ended up getting like a
couple seeds on that as well I never
[SPEAKER_01]: popped them or anything, but it was kind
of cool You know, it was a piffy male the
[SPEAKER_01]: females that I got from No seeds weren't
as piffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only got six seeds from them originally,
you know, and I Popped four of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: kept two and you know, I popped the other
two a few years later, but they didn't end
[SPEAKER_00]: up going so Wow, that's like so cool like
full circle, you know as as we were
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting about earlier You know like body
giving you a shout out in his most recent
[SPEAKER_00]: episode That's that's really interesting
that he sent you those seeds and and I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess there's another sort of
synchronization In a loop back into it all
[SPEAKER_00]: The band-aid haze, you know, it's got got
the Cuban black haze in it I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you work with the band-aid haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you have a plan to what's your
thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you consider it a haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people were a bit weird about
it, but most people are like really into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Like the band-aid, you know Don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like the Cuban black haze a little
bit better I feel like the band-aid is a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit longer flowering than the original
Black haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time I had access to band-aid,
I already had the black haze So at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point I was a guy I'd rather just grow the
original, you know, but not saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a good cut It has a nice uplifting
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have read with it I crossed it to the
blockades but little feminized BX with
[SPEAKER_01]: that I called that black band-aid only
like ten packs went out to some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: early followers I Crossed it to the Harlem
dreams as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it at the moment,
but You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might get it back and breathe with it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens Yeah, sure and I
look that makes sense if like if sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: in a attribute sense You've you've got
better use out of the original then
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously it makes sense to breathe with
that One of our listeners was wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: the do you know the band-aid haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that use the original cut or the s1
when they made it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the original cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back then Bodhi got the original cut
from Asher in Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Shout out to the homie Asher Asher one
on IC mag He gave him the cut back then
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the real human black haze and no s1
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so my other quick follow-up one
was does that mean sometimes I've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: the word money Mike's black haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the s1?
[SPEAKER_01]: Money Mike's black haze is is that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep So that's kind of how the chain went.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I think it went from Asher to
money Mike to Bodhi maybe Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I know Asher is the one who supplied
that cut originally Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, sure sure sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think I'm with you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm with you So yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump back to it So, you know you
you made those initial crosses and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: that bit of experience with the floral
which is really cool It's something I
[SPEAKER_00]: would love to do one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a chance to do it myself
Where did you go next from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, you know, I Started having new
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was slowing down on growing a bit and
then once I bought my first house,
[SPEAKER_01]: I Was you know built out my basement and
was going full speed growing and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time I was just only I was always
growing a little something but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when I really went up full seed and
I was going to a lot of conventions and
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting people and You know swan boy seeds
were a big inspiration for me because I
[SPEAKER_01]: went to go see them at a knee can in
Boston and they were doing a big seed
[SPEAKER_01]: release there and You know, it was a lot,
you know I did the math on it on how much
[SPEAKER_01]: those packs were and how many there were
and I was like man These guys are freaking
[SPEAKER_01]: killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try it man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was working seven days a week
two jobs You know taking care of five kids
[SPEAKER_01]: said shit man If I could sell some seeds
and this is gonna help me out then I'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: it and I did it man You know, I'm so
grateful for it now Totally man totally I
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out to Big Ricky and chrome,
you know Obviously TK swamp boys
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal stuff How did how did you
progress to to offering the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what was your first offering and
What what sort of led after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first offerings I think were like
some sour diesel line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working it was AJ sour cut cross
with a Sour double Kush from Canaventure
[SPEAKER_01]: cross to the southern, Nevada for
reservation labs, I think that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first drop but You know, I really started
making a name when I when I reversed the
[SPEAKER_01]: pif s1 and I made the pif s2 and then I
reversed the black haze made the black
[SPEAKER_01]: haze crosses and then the hard dreams came
and You know, so I just started kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: offering them on Instagram and then it
started getting like a lot So I made a
[SPEAKER_01]: website and just kept going from there
That's really really cool out of curiosity
[SPEAKER_00]: before we move on did anyone Send you any
photos they found out of those packs that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of really impressed you did you end
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know anything come back your way as a
result of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah, man, a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have so many beautiful photos of these
of these plants You know something that
[SPEAKER_01]: came back to me was the Harlem dreams
actually You know when I when I reversed
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cuban black haze I hit everything in
the stable The Santa Cruz blue dream was
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really think much of it,
you know, everyone loves blue dream But no
[SPEAKER_01]: one's crazy about blue dream You know,
it's just a big-ass yielding awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: planet for a cold leader You know,
but I didn't think much of the seeds but
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my customers hit me up and he was
like yo man I I grew this Harlem dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Just want you to try a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sent me a sample And when I tried it
man, I was blown away It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it was purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled like straight pif It was it
left that incense smell in the room After
[SPEAKER_01]: he smoked it, which is like a big thing
that pif does It had the taste it was
[SPEAKER_01]: everything so I hit him up where I was
like, yo, I need that cut And it's funny
[SPEAKER_01]: because I ended up popping I didn't even
pop those seeds until then that day I
[SPEAKER_01]: popped 25 of those seeds and I didn't find
one fino that was as good as that one so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, eventually I'm like yo dog,
let me get the cut and He gave me the cut
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never wanted to be named but you know
who you are brother Appreciate you man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it's a big one Harlem dreams is a
huge one for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome Yeah, what a beautiful story
and Give a shout out to a homie down under
[SPEAKER_00]: Eli cash He he popped some of the Harlem
dreams s1s found a really nice fino has
[SPEAKER_00]: done some breeding of his own with it So
there you go testament to the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah, that's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna ask maybe there's a question
Quick little follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the combo of like obviously,
you know As you just said Cuban black haze
[SPEAKER_00]: blue dream bit of an unexpected winner
there Were there any other combos that
[SPEAKER_00]: caught you a bit off guard with what you
saw come out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, yeah, like that Autobahn haze I
have a I have a fino of the Autobahn
[SPEAKER_01]: perps, which is holy which is a Harlem
dreams That's what the Autobahn old and
[SPEAKER_01]: remember the Autobahn gold is the hundred
and twenty days Right, but this fino is
[SPEAKER_01]: like 65 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe it You know,
that's something that caught me off guard
[SPEAKER_00]: recently like, you know in fino hunting
Yeah, totally totally I guess as we talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more about breeding I'd love to know
like is there is there a certain like
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophy or sort of guideline you're
trying to adhere to or is it more just
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of playing and exploring and I guess
as a quick example by that do you Have
[SPEAKER_00]: this approach where it's like I just want
to work with sort of haze Dominant stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it like no, no, no, I'm not
confining myself like that, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just what I'm interested in right now
Well, you know, I love haze I love sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel I love turps man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love all the fire turps I have I am
partial to haze of course, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly that's what I work with but I Other
flavors, you know, I like I like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything sure sure and I Wanted to ask
you like, you know, what's your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: on?
[SPEAKER_00]: The progression of the seed market because
I think it's undeniable that over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: say five to ten years Feminized seeds have
really become the dominant driver in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market in terms of supply and demand And
when I speak to a lot of breeders many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them say that this is being reflected in
this not not just in their sales But in
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're planning to do, you know,
you've got breeders like exotic Mike who
[SPEAKER_00]: at one point in time were very Reluctant
to do fams and now it's all he does and he
[SPEAKER_00]: says, you know, it's just because the
numbers speak for themselves Are you
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling anything like that at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you offer both regs and fams Do you
plan to continue offering regs or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like the markets just too strong and
there's not the demand?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm always gonna offer regs as well
because I want to think about the other
[SPEAKER_01]: people that want to breed to you know Like
me like I would have loved to buy some
[SPEAKER_01]: piff regs, you know, so yeah, I mean I'm
just waiting for The right mail to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: piff regular my sour diesels or regs right
now, you know But yeah, I'm cool with regs
[SPEAKER_01]: and fams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just whatever the project is I feel
like it's a lot easier with regs because a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of problems happen with reversals so
sometimes you miss out and you lose a crop
[SPEAKER_01]: and this sucks, you know, but It happens,
you know regs are definitely a lot easier
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure Totally and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to actually take A moment to jump
into this because so many people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: never done reversals would understandably
underestimate the issues that can go wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, so I'd love to hear one of your
reversal failures because I've told mine
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really want to hammer at home that
like I you know, I feel like it's up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the stars sometimes as to where the
reversals work Well shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you my latest dilemma my holy
communion X Hopefully, you know someone
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome is listening to this and has an
answer But I've tried to reverse it four
[SPEAKER_01]: times now the first run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just STS normal every three days
the second run Well, actually my friend
[SPEAKER_01]: tried it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did STS failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried this last run I did two plants
STS two plants colloidal silver and two
[SPEAKER_01]: plants elite times elite all You know
different ratios and If they all created
[SPEAKER_01]: the sacks, but no pollen no seeds So yeah,
I can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna reverse So I've had trouble
in the past, but usually when you do
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple plants You'll get some that
you'll still get some but this one I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Would love the scientific reason for
that, you know Yeah, that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess just as a quick follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever pollinated it does it make
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've pollinated her and she does she
make seeds That's a real interesting one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like obviously historically TK
has held the crown as being like the very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult plant to reverse but um It's
it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like this one could also be up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe someone has the answer Maybe they
can they can help chime in that that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be really interesting if they did that
would be cool, man Yeah, I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly loop back because in the past
Answer you mentioned the pifco sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about your sour how
it came to be in existence I took a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: look online before and I think you use
some karma genetics in it Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the pifco sour I was collecting all the
sour diesel cuts, you know the Chaco cut
[SPEAKER_01]: res dogs cut the Albany cut not so cut the
Devil Harvest crew cut, you know J plant
[SPEAKER_01]: speakers cut you name it like I had every
So cut they could find and I hit them all
[SPEAKER_01]: with the karma genetics sour diesel BX to
shout out to the homie karma man he sent
[SPEAKER_01]: me those seeds as well and You know,
I hunted 200 seeds and Found you know my
[SPEAKER_01]: my sour the pifco sour diesel and that one
ended up being the J plant speaker sour
[SPEAKER_00]: cross with the with the karma Well,
I want to talk about your one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we go there tell me Like
roughly out of all those sour clones you
[SPEAKER_00]: listed which ones did you think were
alright and which not so much?
[SPEAKER_01]: so Historically like originally on the
forums There was really just the Chaco and
[SPEAKER_01]: the AJ cut the Chaco was the real cut the
AJ cut was not the real cut and You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just how it was now I've met AJ in
real life and his cut is the real cut but
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that went around on the farm in
the day as the AJ cut was like a taller
[SPEAKER_01]: lanky headband kind of Looking kind and
didn't really grow like sour like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chaco was always the real one And I still
stand by that like the Albany was really
[SPEAKER_01]: good, too The rezco is really good,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all right there, you know But the
Chaco is just has always been the one know
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've that's the one I've had the
longest That's the one that I've always
[SPEAKER_01]: had a sour before I got all these hype
sour cuts No, that was just always like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's my sour And the AJ but you know,
the Chaco was always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Why did you go with the J plant
speaker one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the best female that came out
of the seeds man, you know, I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: control it just because I like the Chaco
the best as the cut out of those seeds man
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that J plant speaker one at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was there there best taste It really
filled the palette with the sour rocket
[SPEAKER_01]: fuel taste, you know that a lot of sour
hasn't really been hitting like lately so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I Kept that one man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what you're gonna get out
of these seeds Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it almost like you people can take
You know rest easy knowing that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done the permeations and combinations And
as you said, you know different things are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna click better than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool to hear Do you plan to
mostly do hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna keep purifying, you know,
like I know calm is I think he's gone to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bx4 Do you have any plans to do that
or what's your plans to do with the line
[SPEAKER_00]: overall?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm at f2 now, so I've gone two
generations I'm gonna go f3 is next.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I'm also gonna do like a back cross
maybe You know do some in crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: different crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing definitely some hybrids,
you know Working on that probably outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: next year Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and You just mentioned outdoors,
you know, which of your offerings would
[SPEAKER_00]: you say lean a bit more to the outdoor
side?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a Bit better out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Well, our sour jesals were like record
some of the best frickin outdoor stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've seen, you know in These areas so
that was cool Those were actually bred
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor that generation, but I have done a
couple generations outdoors as well I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all different man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally the hazes are pretty good
outdoors If you can get the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: finish in time if you're in like somewhere
like where it's nice all the time and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have Unlimited flowering time then you can
do great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually don't mold up too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty fast resistant We just have
to hear finding the ones that finish in
[SPEAKER_00]: time Sure, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Had a few people ask they are they
noticed you were working with the block
[SPEAKER_00]: work haze I couldn't find too much
information about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us the genetics and what that
one brings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the block work haze is the green
haze crossed with Harlem dream So the
[SPEAKER_01]: green haze has always been my favorite
cut, you know back in the day all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of hazes You could get the
gold haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the dark brown haze You can
get the army green haze or you can get the
[SPEAKER_01]: neon green haze and the neon green haze is
the one that I always liked You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just got this extra sharpness to it
So yeah, I crossed that to the Harlem I
[SPEAKER_01]: only gave those seeds out to the people
who came to that year's PIF con in the VIP
[SPEAKER_01]: box So there was 50 packs released total
and one of the growers out of there took
[SPEAKER_01]: that and won first place the next year at
New York growers cup So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Yeah, so that's what block work
haze is though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a green haze times Harlem dreams Nice
okay, and would you say that it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: in that category of sativa's where it's
like Really really like racy like maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit anxiety edge or is it more Like just
like uplifting and fun and not not like on
[SPEAKER_01]: that anxiety end of things I Don't get too
much anxiety from it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I have but everybody's
endocannabinoid system is different So
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to say man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never really promise on effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one thing I you know,
I can give you good turps I can give you
[SPEAKER_01]: the right turps, but I can't tell you how
it's gonna affect your body, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to quickly ask one of the fans
asked have you run any of the Masonic
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson cross Cuban black haze Yeah,
shout out to the Sonic Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a keeper cut of El Cubano It's a 56
day cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells piffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a little pink on the finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty nice, man You know,
he ran a whole bed of the of some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: this year and cross them all again And you
know, I like Masonic May school Shout out
[SPEAKER_01]: to him man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like the El Cubano as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fire Totally man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out my Sonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like him as well I wanted to quickly ask
you what were your thoughts and your
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions on the Dutch haze, you know,
like I mean, obviously you've mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Harare, but what about things like
amnesia haze or some of the really old
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch haze like, you know, like I guess
like the original haze for lack of a
[SPEAKER_01]: better words like positronic sort of stuff
Well, you know a lot of that stuff kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: just falls under the jack turps for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of You know Terpeneleon
dominance that being said, you know when I
[SPEAKER_01]: came to spannibus my first time in Europe
Karma gave me some nevels haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very piffy, you know,
so the I see that somebody You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you just got to find the right stuff
This terpeneleon is so dominant that most
[SPEAKER_01]: haze seeds on the market If there's any
trace of terpeneleon in the in the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, it's gonna be terpeneleon Dom
You know, you don't really find that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: too often Yeah, no totally totally I
wanted to ask you your thoughts on like
[SPEAKER_00]: how we might be able to Initiate people
into sativas who maybe aren't sort of that
[SPEAKER_00]: interested or maybe just haven't had the
greatest experience I guess the first
[SPEAKER_00]: question is do you do you think that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The the best way is through something
maybe that you might argue is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more approachable at first like like a
super silver haze Or just something a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more chill or do you think na na na go for
the more unique like long flowering see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim black haze a5 c5 something a bit more
like, you know, maybe a bit more like more
[SPEAKER_00]: risk more reward sort of vibe What's your
thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know the nose nose, bro So if
you have access and you can smell some
[SPEAKER_01]: samples and check out some stuff and see
what you're vibing with try it out You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, that's what I say A lot of people
have a big misconception Of what sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: and indica really is, you know,
it doesn't mean that it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: uplifting just because it's a
narrow-leafed plant You know a lot of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff is based on the terpenes So it's
tough, you know, it's tough to navigate
[SPEAKER_01]: but you just got to have good weed man
show it to people They're gonna smell it
[SPEAKER_01]: if they like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna smoke it You know Yeah,
certainly I guess if I zoom out from that
[SPEAKER_00]: question do you feel like Like more and
more people are losing that passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa because sometimes I hear this
sentiment that like the younger
[SPEAKER_00]: generations They're just sort of into
indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have never even really had
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you feel that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any concerns or thoughts about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's more about the newer
generation is kind of likes the candy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that's just what it is at
least here You know, but there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be people there that like sativas or
like the idea of sativa And we'll go
[SPEAKER_01]: searching for it and you know,
and they'll find it, you know So I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: think You know and also there are short
flowering sativas, so they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: completely gone most commercial
cultivations Also offer sativa as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know at least here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure how it is for the rest of
the world Yeah, no certainly certainly I
[SPEAKER_00]: do love me so much some short flaring
sativas and and for me That was the
[SPEAKER_00]: gateway into the more longer stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think it's and but
likewise, you know I've had some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: profound experiences just having some long
flowering stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think either is probably a pretty
reasonable approach I guess I I sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: implied it in that last question,
but I haven't asked you have you smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the the the a5 or the c5 clone
that you know sort of go around and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts on those as alternative nl5
haze cuts that are considered in pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: high regard Yeah, man, I had I I had yo
Sammy visit us here man, and he brought
[SPEAKER_01]: some a5 and c5 I was able to smoke both of
them They were good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the a5 for sure the c5 jack turps
not my thing But I see why it was
[SPEAKER_01]: important, you know, if that's the mother
of all of most Jack It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, the a5 was spicy leathery,
you know, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did definitely piff reminiscent Yeah,
nice nice I had a I had a bit of a weird
[SPEAKER_00]: question for you, but it came up a lot
amongst the patreon listeners So I did
[SPEAKER_00]: want to ask it which is why do you think
that the pfn and also sour?
[SPEAKER_00]: What why do they draw so much emotion from
the masses?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it feels like the conversations
get really heated and they feel so
[SPEAKER_00]: polarizing about the backstories What do
you think it is that makes these strains
[SPEAKER_00]: evoke such emotion from people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like anything else, you know
People you know, some people have really
[SPEAKER_01]: made a living off of this off of this,
you know and have families or lost loved
[SPEAKER_01]: ones for Haynes and sour So it's a touchy
subject for some people, you know And then
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it just is what it is Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean while I've got you on,
you know I haven't had a chance to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: to many East Coasters in the recent past
and In the advent of the whole sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: pack Revolution, I'd love to hear your
thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you think it's a dying fad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's something that's gonna
stay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that at least from what I hear that
they're more prevalent sort of on the East
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast What's been your experience with it
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, spray packs are going crazy right
now in New York City man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild, you know But listen if kids are
gonna smoke cotton candy flavored vapes
[SPEAKER_01]: why and if they have the opportunity to
smoke the same cotton candy flavor on weed
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't they that's what they're
smoking, you know So yeah, it sucks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but it is what it is and there
will always be people something natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Not to worry, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're gonna get taken over
by spray turps anytime soon, but I would
[SPEAKER_01]: watch out more for like a lot of terpene
companies make imitation turps so I could
[SPEAKER_01]: grow some some runs that looks like you
know looks really good but has no turps
[SPEAKER_01]: and then just Spray it with extra runs And
that's happening a lot too, you know So
[SPEAKER_01]: you never know what's in that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really I don't mess with the spray
turps at all You know, but can't stop them
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my only follow-up is do you think
that it will sort of fall in popularity
[SPEAKER_00]: but still sort of remain in the background
or do you think it's like a trend and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just gonna fall off eventually and We'll
just move on Well, it'll probably around
[SPEAKER_01]: me and if they find a way to Make sure
it's safe and stuff and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed companies are doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's already many infused
products on the market You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, mostly it's infused with
botanically derived turps that are
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposedly of the same strain,
you know just to make it a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: smelly or last longer in the jar You know,
so this stuff is happening now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't think it's gonna go
anywhere Maybe with legalization tougher
[SPEAKER_01]: to do flavored stuff, you know on the
legal market So you probably won't see it
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know At least for a while
because that more appeals to kids and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why they don't allow that,
you know Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I understand I wanted to ask you What
pack would you recommend for someone
[SPEAKER_00]: listening who just wants to try some PIF
type genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know something where they might be
able to find a plan in there that has you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some of the Attributes that sort of
people are really fond of in the PIF
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, man, like I would go for the
midnight mass That's just like if someone
[SPEAKER_01]: put a gun to my head and said pop one seed
and it has to have the turps Like I would
[SPEAKER_01]: go at the midnight mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Cuban black haze bx1 Using the
Harlem dreams Those have been around for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while, you know good seed stock many many
great females in there As far as the new
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses from the block work run,
I would go With like the block haze that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the block where it is crossed back to the
Cuban black haze So again, it's just you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you're gonna find in there and you
know, you'll find some good ones for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: But really honestly anything I offer man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything I offer is is gonna be what it is
You know, you just gotta what's your
[SPEAKER_01]: preference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I love that and on the other end of
the spectrum for maybe someone who's a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more initiated willing to run things
longer What would be your recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: for like, you know, someone who's like,
I want to run something a hundred days
[SPEAKER_00]: plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just dropped these type hips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's double tie from a seeds It's the
coaching tie across with the Mayo tie and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I cross that one for the block work
haze You know, so you'll find some hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: and twenty days in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I've read of that cross, but I haven't
really spoken to anyone who's run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about what
your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: With that one is like and and what what's
the effect like on those those land race
[SPEAKER_00]: tires?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds cool It's really cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually quite piffy and I was
surprised, you know Because I always
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that it came more from the
Colombian side.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's what people say,
you know, but this this tie is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of Incense II and you know kind of
kind of piffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little different, but I really like
it man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super long flowering But I think
people are really gonna dig that one man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you know It's good shit That
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sort of read my mind because my
next question was gonna be Do you plan to
[SPEAKER_00]: look into like more raw?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unworked sort of stuff like land race or
do you think you want to do more refining
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you've already got?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know always refining what I have
but at the same time I'm always creating
[SPEAKER_01]: something new in those generations,
too You know, so I'm always gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: adding some new stuff old stuff cool stuff
in the mix Whatever kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come across, you know great lately I ran
into some after I was in California and I
[SPEAKER_01]: really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got the cuts I got the mom goo in the
after I'm across them to the haze and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully find some piff goo and That
shit's gonna be fire man, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's just anything, you know But yeah,
I have some seeds on the list that I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to pop I got you know some old stuff Some
new stuff some stuff that I made,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love to ask people what do you consider
to be like the rarest seeds in your
[SPEAKER_00]: collection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for sentimental or the historical
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what's the stuff that you know,
you would grab first not necessarily to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop but just rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I Don't know man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot We'll see Damn, I don't know
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough I have a lot of old amazing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just won't know but I do know that if
every anything ever happens I will get my
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and run out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that's where you're running
first Yeah, yes, definitely to the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay one of our listeners they they wanted
to ask you if you could give us a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of info on the piff s2s, you know,
we did sort of mention them a bit earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like How would you describe them and
what are some of the differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in effect and profile because you
mentioned that you know shorter flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: was something you were aiming for What
else sort of goes along with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna find some super piffy stuff
in there man shorter plants like it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: on the nl5 side So, you know, but it
really does carry that piff turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say like, you know Five out
of ten pinos had it and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some pinos would be like a little more ED
side like kind of like beef jerky ish and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I've seen some weird stuff come
out of there I've seen some really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff come out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my keeper out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the PC 3 the piff coast 3 You
know, I gave it to purple city genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were selling it as the New York City
piff number 3 So it's been in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities across the United States and
you know, that's kind of what one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: well-known cuts So yeah that came right
out of the piff s2, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you got those seeds pop You can find
some fire in there Yeah, nice nice I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask you because one of the
listeners they did sort of pose an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting question and I'll try to frame
it because I'm not aware of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: Intricacies of it all but basically they
were sort of saying that like from what
[SPEAKER_00]: they had heard like the nuggies cut was
maybe a bit more nl leaning compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the the other one and They sort of felt
like that detracted a bit from the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: essence of the piff being in that like
it's meant to be this sativa and I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested in hearing like do you
just view it like it's all it's all the
[SPEAKER_00]: same line It's just various
representations of it or do you do you
[SPEAKER_00]: view?
[SPEAKER_00]: The piff is like it is this sativa thing
and it should stay that like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously more of a philosophical view But
how do you view the line in that sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know came from like what we call
the brown haze cut, you know, so that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't derive from nuggets Cuban black
haze but at the same time I've grown both
[SPEAKER_01]: Asher's cut straight from Asher and
Nuggets cut straight from from nugget and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Cuban black haze man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only there's only one real cut you
know, so So it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's it same shit man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay The next question I want to quickly
ask you and before I wanted to jump into
[SPEAKER_00]: some piff constant Which I'm excited to
talk about is what gets you excited?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain wise is there a clone out there
that maybe you've tried or you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: yet I know you just mentioned the aft GUI
So I'm gonna make you I'm gonna pull
[SPEAKER_00]: another one out of you But um,
is there is there something that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to work with in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, man, that's why it's kind of
is awesome, you know, I got that double
[SPEAKER_01]: tie from a fifth con grower You know,
so like it's awesome to see all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different hazes that people enter every
year and you know That's kind of my way to
[SPEAKER_01]: to find some new genetics as well,
man, and we do data Data testing on all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them as well, you know, so it's really
cool data collection Finding some really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool hazes that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some come across some really
nice stuff definitely That's so awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're able to get stuff back from
your supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear about pifcon So why don't
we start off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you tell me about the Genesis,
you know, where did the idea come from and
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you first start to get the wheels
in motion to bring it to life from an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I was just going to events
around New York City and there's a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: different competitions and I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me uh Make one for pit, you know,
and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're here four years later and
it's getting bigger and bigger every year
[SPEAKER_01]: We had over 2,000 people last year pifcon
is a If he's convention and competition
[SPEAKER_01]: hosted in New York City You can enter one
ounce of flour You know to be judged by 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hand-selected judges, you know So yeah,
it's really cool man, it's a competition a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people come out for it It's the
premiere, you know sativa haze cup man
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where all the sativa lovers come
out all the pif lovers all the haze lovers
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's the most amazing thing in the
world to me man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's my favorite that every year
Wow, that's incredible I can only imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I want to ask some more specifics
about it But first I want to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition how much work goes into
setting it up It's a lot of work,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of work But it takes me all
year to set it up and then all year again
[SPEAKER_01]: for the next year You know, but it's worth
it, man It's so worth it to bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: community together, you know to have the
all everybody in haze comes together for
[SPEAKER_01]: pifcon, man It's so cool that that's
killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many how many people do you think end
up attending?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first year we had 300 The second
year we had 700 and then the third year we
[SPEAKER_01]: had 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh My god, that's so cool for an organic
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me what was the most recent one
like I've seen videos It looked like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was going hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a giant nightclub, you know with
50 he's vendors that flew in from across
[SPEAKER_01]: the country to show it off of these are
you know, you can get a genetics there You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you got everybody entering in the
competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got You know just so much cool shit,
man It smells like incense for them for a
[SPEAKER_01]: block away, you know when you pull up to
pifcon, it's awesome What was uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was the most impressive sample you
tried the most recent one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, that's hard to say man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't I can't say
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me one or two that you know Just were
good enough that they sort of jumped to
[SPEAKER_00]: mine and there's many more excellent
unnamed ones You know, oh actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a he's a grower out of New York He he
entered some midnight bass that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: love to you know right off the bat Man I'm
trying to think and I think you know for
[SPEAKER_01]: me 70 Haley's comment is some of my
favorite too, you know that was entered
[SPEAKER_01]: into the last pifcon So those were though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those were my two picks but you
know the judges the judges voted and The
[SPEAKER_01]: band-aid one man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to bode You know band-aid one
shout out to doc D2 for all the for all
[SPEAKER_01]: that work there man and shout out to rich
so far He was the grower of the band-aid
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a phenomenal job You know give you
guys a tip, you know curing is super
[SPEAKER_01]: important And if the weed is still spongy
and and you know smelling good It's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have a higher chance with the judges man
if the stuff's dry by the time I get it
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're gonna get overlooked
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was one of those guys that just his
flower was fresh It was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well is beautiful and that's the one that
took it man You know, that's exciting I I
[SPEAKER_00]: might have missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many categories are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just the one?
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually it's three categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So That was the over 75 day flowering
category or the connoisseur great and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we have the commercial grade which is
under 75 day that one was taken by lobster
[SPEAKER_01]: family farms with his Holy Communion,
you know, and then we also have an
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts category and I think pots knobs
one with the new berry haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure up top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that yeah, I believe so Wow and
and something I I love to ask everyone who
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeds with sativas is do you feel that
you can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Encapsulate that sativa feeling into a
concentrate or do you feel like it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not quite the same as when you say have
the flower You know, I got it we make all
[SPEAKER_01]: those different types of extracts You
know, I got piff carts that leave that
[SPEAKER_01]: piff incense smell in the room after you
puff it You know, they don't really wash
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, honestly most sativas with the
smaller glands and the long stalks and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, but You know, I BHL works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know other extraction methods,
but we're gonna find watchers to I just
[SPEAKER_01]: did some piff washer crosses So we're
gonna find some hash making piff this year
[SPEAKER_01]: because hash rosin is a big big market in
the United States Totally totally and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that concentrates are a key gateway
to the younger audience who are most
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilizing pens and things like that,
you know, obviously you're talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher grade product than a pen But you
know you get my point, but I guess I'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested to hear Do you think that
overall with time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could get to the point where like
people are really really into sativas Or
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think like it'll always probably be
the the smaller subsect and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the the minority not the majority
Well, every place is different man sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: is the most requested train in New York,
you know People want sativas here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's different in every market man,
you know stuff it's tough to say so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just more about finding good turps and
good flour and good experience and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know wherever you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter the strain man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just matters whether It's it's good
and people like it, you know In the course
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa Totally totally totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just got to get to the point
where people can try it, you know I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that was my issue for the longest time Was
just exposure I couldn't get it But that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really just a testament to what you're
doing helping get get the genetics out
[SPEAKER_00]: there So people can expose themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think we're on to the the quickfire
final questions at this point So the first
[SPEAKER_00]: one that I wanted to ask you was what was
the single most memorable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience you've had, you know,
and I say to people I'm not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning like the most stoned you've ever
been but just like the most memorable for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason It with cannabis It comes
right off the top of my head is when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: younger One guy that I used to buy haze
from used to chill at the corner of my
[SPEAKER_01]: block and he had his car always there and
One day my brother was walking over by
[SPEAKER_01]: that corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found a bag of haze that was ran over
and he brought it home and gave it to me
[SPEAKER_01]: and I traded him like an ounce of Reggie
for it and It was like a 2.1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was completely flattened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was lime green haze and I love that
shit That's just a funny story that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a what a great early memory on
the other end of the spectrum So to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: what's a strain where everyone was hyping
it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You were quite excited to try it and then
eventually when you did you were left a
[SPEAKER_01]: little disappointed Hmm That's a tough man
Um, I don't know I'm never too
[SPEAKER_01]: disappointed with strains man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know there's like Everything has
this place, you know Um Yeah, I can't say
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hey, that's a good problem to have
if you've never if nothing jumps to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that So imagine I'm gonna Drop you
off on a desert island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take three strains or packs of
seeds with you, you know It could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three things are you gonna take to
grow out for the rest of eternity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man three things to grow up the rest of
eternity I'm gonna take The Holy Communion
[SPEAKER_01]: X I'm gonna take Cliff Coast for diesel
and I'm gonna take the grapefruit cam And
[SPEAKER_01]: that's it I'm out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Tell me a little bit about the
grapefruit cam quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it on your Instagram page Grapefruit
cam is also man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the top five strains that I've
ever grown non hazes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say top five but Super loud man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like how loud sour diesel was back in
the day is how a grapefruit cam is Great
[SPEAKER_01]: was across from Breeder Steve sweeping
grapefruit to what I believe is Chem D but
[SPEAKER_01]: there was three Cams in the room at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not really sure which one but out
of the progeny I would say it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: to be You know, um, but yeah, it's it's
from trade wind seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the homie man I was at the 2016
knee cam and I was wearing a fuck cookie
[SPEAKER_01]: shirt Because at the time, you know,
I'm like everybody's trust the cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck that, you know, so I was rocking that
wave and The homie trade winds really like
[SPEAKER_01]: my shirt and he's like don't want to show
you this And he popped it open and the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole crowd around me was like And they
all turned and looked at the jar and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the grapefruit cam man and yo homie
was so cool that he went home and he
[SPEAKER_01]: brought me back cuts the same day,
you know, I've been rocking the grapefruit
[SPEAKER_01]: cam since then so That's the only
treatment seed company That's killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question is Imagine there's
been a massive fire You didn't get to save
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole seed company Collection,
but you know as you're sieving through the
[SPEAKER_00]: ashes There's one unscathed pack that you
can use to restart your whole company
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the one pack you're going to use to
restart the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, hopefully there's still a pack of
black bar keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're Harlan things in the area That's
where that's what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna I'm gonna be a stickler and
pushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pick one of the two which one
Damn it, man You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go with the block work He's got a
little more variety in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I ask one that I'll get a little more
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See now you know you're breaking the rules
of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need Okay, so the final
question I love to ask everybody I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a time machine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go anywhere anytime any place you
can get seeds or a clone Where you gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you gonna get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm gonna go back and meet Neville
man, you know see what his original hazes
[SPEAKER_01]: were like, you know when the Cubans first
started growing the haze and You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go back then and just to just to see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a really big part of it,
you know That's a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's so true to your roots that it
makes perfect sense And I'm sure you would
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd find a bunch of cool stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt So that's epic man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with that it just about brings us
