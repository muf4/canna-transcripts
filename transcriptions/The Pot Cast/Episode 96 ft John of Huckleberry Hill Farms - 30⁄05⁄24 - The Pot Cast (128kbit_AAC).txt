[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you what, I've never looked back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their unit is the most potent,
the most highly replicating of a bong hit

[SPEAKER_00]: an up and coming star and an all-around
lovely guy, John of Huckleberry Hill
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to talk all things.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plans for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without further delay, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty gang, welcome back for another
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on today, we are incredibly grateful
to have a humble native, a career grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, operator of Huckleberry Hill
Farms and an all-around lovely guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A massive welcome to John for taking the
time to come on the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to talking with you
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's lovely to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question we love to ask guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you been smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to be completely honest,
I usually don't smoke until, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: later on in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I do, it's usually just a few
puffs here or there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's usually a couple hits
on the White Thorn Rose, one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: signature strains or trying out a few new
phenos that we tried to create from last
[SPEAKER_02]: year's seed stock and really trying to
figure out which ones will be something
[SPEAKER_02]: that we decide to plant for this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So always smoking kind of something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you're a man after my own
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I too transitioned from having brekkie
bongs to just smoking in the evening,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually after the kids have gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can certainly appreciate how much,
or for me at least, it helped me to
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate cannabis a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started getting a lot more hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who's come across your brand would
have seen the iconic strain that's
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit quickly about the
inception of that one because it's such a
[SPEAKER_00]: signature strain for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that strain first come to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you've grown, I've been
growing for maybe 45 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's always still exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single year is exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single year is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what really becomes very exciting to a
lot of us growers is the breeding process
[SPEAKER_02]: and really trying to find the next new
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how White Thorn Rose
came to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in honor of my mom, who passed away,
I really wanted to make this farm about
[SPEAKER_02]: her and about what she taught me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all the different strains that we
grow here, are bred to a strain I used to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow with her when I was 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that strain was called Fruit Loops
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did rename it to Paradise Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so White Thorn Rose is a Lemono G
crossed with the Paradise Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we named it after my girlfriend Rose
and after the town of White Thorn,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is right down the road, where I
consider to be really the bullseye of a
[SPEAKER_02]: dartboard where a billion-dollar industry
was created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say that because back in the 80s and
back in the 90s, there was enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were flying helicopters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were dropping guys down on wires and
eradicating the cannabis plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: arresting you if they could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really Humboldt County and White
Thorn, the town of White Thorn was really
[SPEAKER_02]: the epicenter of those enforcement dollars
that they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pretty, pretty sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought White Thorn Rose was a
fitting name for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cultivar, so many people like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it would help tell the
story of the Emerald Triangle small
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: An homage to your mom, your hometown,
your partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a brilliant trifecta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize you have this epic backstory and
let's jump into it because I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been in the beating heart and
epicenter of worldwide cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little bit first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go all the way back to the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I moved here to this very piece
of property that we're sitting on today
[SPEAKER_02]: and moved here with my mom and my stepdad
when I was five years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really from the first two years that
we moved here, cannabis was a part of our
[SPEAKER_02]: life, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a small part of our income
that we had to do to live in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we grew a little bit cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were part-time loggers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were part-time commercial fishermen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cut firewood in the wintertime and sold
it to a local merchant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just did a bunch of different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis really very quickly for me
growing up as a kid became like growing a
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really looked at it as just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom really taught me everything I
know about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she really taught me that there's no
SOP standard operating procedure that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could write down on a piece of paper
because every strain kind of needed its
[SPEAKER_02]: own individual attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like OG and White Thorn Rose
could be grown exactly the same and they
[SPEAKER_02]: both could thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was the one that really taught me
that they each needed individual attention
[SPEAKER_02]: and that they each needed to be grown a
little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really from the age of 10 that I
started growing with her and she gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: little chores like checking the emitters,
the drippers, checking the water tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't really take that long before
I really wanted to experiment around and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what these different cultivars or
these different strains responded to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were already doing some stuff together
like putting rusty nails in the planter
[SPEAKER_02]: box for the iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: At harvest time, we were using birth
control pills because a neighbor had told
[SPEAKER_02]: us that that would help the flowers harden
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would sometimes pull the big plants out
of the ground with the roots and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything and we'd stick those roots in
boiling water before we hung them upside
[SPEAKER_02]: down because somebody said that all the
resin would go to the flower if we did
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't do any of that stuff
today, but I still experiment around in my
[SPEAKER_02]: own little ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so extreme, I guess, to really find
out what these plants really respond to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, I'll just keep going a little
bit unless you want me to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really took like four or five,
six years before, you know, I could talk
[SPEAKER_02]: my mom into giving me my own plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, that was, you know,
my goal is to have my own plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow them the way I wanted to grow
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, she struggled as being a
parent, you know, to let your kid grow
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was technically legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do I let him do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a good mom, ba ba ba.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after I nagged enough, I think she
gave in and she said, OK, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are the conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And given none of these plants were ever
grown in our front yard, these were plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that we had to like make trails and hide
the trails and hike into the woods and
[SPEAKER_02]: hide them from aerial surveillance and
airplanes and helicopters and enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't as easy as it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the condition was any of the
money that if I were to make it to harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the money that I were to make,
it had to go to like a college education
[SPEAKER_02]: or I had to invest it in something,
something for my future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go out and buy a motorcycle or
something that was fun and frivolous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that first year, I remember I made 12
pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the price back then was like
twelve hundred dollars a pound or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, which sounds good
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and so she ended up taking the product
after it was dried and trimmed and she
[SPEAKER_02]: sold it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put I put ten thousand dollars down
on a piece of property along the Eel
[SPEAKER_02]: River, you know, at the age of 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I then started growing there during
the summer times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it just really fell in love with
this plant and growing with my friends and
[SPEAKER_02]: my buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, OK, let's go work on the
gardens in the morning and then let's go
[SPEAKER_02]: surfing or let's go fishing or hiking or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Humboldt County is an amazing place to
to grow up at.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's redwoods everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ocean's right 15 minutes over the
hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of hiking trails and it's
just a very beautiful, clean place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel pretty fortunate growing up
here as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you get a couple of words in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an incredible story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very admirable upbringing that I think
everyone can when they hear that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll think, man, that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'd be interested, given,
you know, you and your parents were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beating heart of cannabis for all those
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question, were there any older
genetics that were ever grown by yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: or your parents that left a really lasting
memory on you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, this one genetic that I
ended up breeding with the Lemon OG to
[SPEAKER_02]: create the White Thorn Rose was a strain
my mom bred with a really good friend of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine's mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a blueberry blueberry kush that
she crossed with my friend's mom's
[SPEAKER_02]: lavender kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And together, they ended up calling that
Fruit Loops at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons we used to grow
that strain, not only because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: really fruity and it tasted amazing,
but it harvested really early.
[SPEAKER_02]: It harvested, you know, early September,
the first week of September.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were on top of your game,
you had the ability to dry it,
[SPEAKER_02]: cure it, trim it and sell it before the
big harvest of Humboldt County came in and
[SPEAKER_02]: dropped the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we always got two or three hundred
dollars more a pound, whatever we trim,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was an early harvester.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also really allowed you to get your
harvest in before maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement teams might eradicate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to reflect a little bit back to
those eradication teams, sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: especially after 1985, Ronald Reagan had
declared the war on drugs and enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: got bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government was supplementing the
counties with monies to do over flights
[SPEAKER_02]: and drop guys in and cut the weed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that got really, really, really bad
and really scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd wake up some mornings, you know,
right at the sunlight and there'd be like
[SPEAKER_02]: a Blackhawk helicopter sitting over your
house with guys and AR-15s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was only a plant, but they took
it seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were doing something bad and,
you know, growing with my best friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was always our opinion that,
well, we're living in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single person we knew was growing
pot back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the few people that we knew that
got caught or got in trouble just got
[SPEAKER_02]: probation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of our game plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we get caught and we get in
trouble, we'll get probation and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: can decide how to go forward with our
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But enforcement was really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there was four or five
helicopters in the air at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really when my parents decided
to move out and they bought a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: fishing boat and really sailed around the
world to China, to excuse me, to the South
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific, to China, to Alaska and really
fished for albacore 11 months out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stayed back here with my best friend
and we just kept growing and we were just
[SPEAKER_02]: loving, loving everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And long story short, we were pretty naive
as Hill kids, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew about redwood trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew about growing pot and fishing and
all those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, worldly, we were pretty naive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we didn't know there was a
difference between, you know, state law
[SPEAKER_02]: and federal law and all these different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then kind of got an eye opener one day
at the age of 24, this old man down our
[SPEAKER_02]: road ended up turning us in to the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, like I said, Ronald Reagan had
declared the war on drugs and he really
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to make an impression on people in
Humboldt and really attempt to stop people
[SPEAKER_02]: from growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had 30 federal agents drive up my
driveway one morning at six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, from that point forward,
my life was never the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was now, you know, getting searched at
the end of that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They searched my place.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eradicated all the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the day,
they left.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a little yellow speeding
ticket and they said, if we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: contact you, we will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, you know, then I'm starting to
learn the difference between state and
[SPEAKER_02]: federal and how they operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a year and a half later, they came
back with a federal arrest warrant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went down to San Francisco Courthouse
building, was arraigned and retained a an
[SPEAKER_02]: attorney and now was being made aware that
there was something called the mandatory
[SPEAKER_02]: minimums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mandatory minimums don't care so
much if you're a first time nonviolent
[SPEAKER_02]: offender.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mandatory minimums don't care if you
would never hurt anybody, if you're nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mandatory minimums really was looking
me straight in the face with the tenure to
[SPEAKER_02]: life in prison for a first time nonviolent
offender.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really refused to end my best
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So together for the next three and a half
years, we went to court.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to court telling the judge,
you know, we were growing the tomato plant
[SPEAKER_02]: or we were growing the weed plant,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would never hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, at the end of three years
of going to court, he stood up and he
[SPEAKER_02]: said, you know, because I'm bound by the
law, you know, I'm going to sentence you
[SPEAKER_02]: to the lower end of the mandatory
minimums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ended up giving us 10 years in
jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in federal prison, you do 85 percent
of your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did eight years in prison,
six years in Lompoc and then another two
[SPEAKER_02]: years at Nellis Air Force Base,
you know, all for this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ironically, full circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm a permitted farm in Humboldt
County and permitted by the state of
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, still to this day,
their rules and their regulations and
[SPEAKER_02]: their laws don't really make a whole lot
of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really like to look at the positive
side of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a it was just a story in my
life that that I had an experience that I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel pretty fortunate that a lot of people
didn't have that gives me a different
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective on the reality of of our
government and the reality of some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool people that are in jail for
really a harmless crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm OK with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, first of all, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: For, you know, I for lack of a better
words, for your service, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've contributed to the scene with
your sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's incredible that sadly
someone as successful as yourself was a
[SPEAKER_00]: victim of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we need to talk about that a
little more because we often on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the people who've come before
us, who have, say, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself, had to serve sentences to
help progress the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we really need to give a bit of
homage to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question that comes to mind is
what why did the old man tip you off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why was he upset?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he was he was about 90 years
old.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had lived in that area for his whole
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just wasn't really keen on having
somebody new move in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I'm really not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, he while we were gone,
he passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, I never had a chance
to ask him or talk to him or it really,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, doesn't matter at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, sometimes people are stuck
in their ways and maybe he didn't agree
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis or whatever his reasoning
was, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so you mentioned that they came
initially and then they sort of left at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a year in between the
visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that year like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you sort of walking on eggshells or
did you just get back to it or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I kind of knew I was in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was a year and a half
before they came back with the the arrest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warrant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was about a year where I
didn't do a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, after a year went by,
I was like, well, you know, maybe they
[SPEAKER_02]: just messed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they just came here and they
realized that, you know, I am somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: that would never hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just some plants and blah,
blah, blah, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started growing again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And long story short, they were following
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I got lucky not to get in
trouble again while I was about to get
[SPEAKER_02]: arrested again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, so I guess they still never
learned my lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here now still doing the same thing
that I was doing back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, no, look, I'm glad you're still
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everyone can relate to that
after a year of waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone would basically assume similar to
yourself that maybe something else has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came back after a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you eventually ended up going to
the federal prison, what was that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any memorable characters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you meet any other growers in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was fortunate enough to go to
Lompoc, which is one of the, they say the
[SPEAKER_02]: cushier, the easier prisons out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom and my dad drove me to prison where
you self-surrender, you self-surrender at
[SPEAKER_02]: the USP, which is the United States
Penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where people have life in prison with the
razor wire, and they check you in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: they fingerprint you in there,
and they process you in there before they
[SPEAKER_02]: take you over to where I finally ended up,
which was the camp, which was a cattle
[SPEAKER_02]: ranch, which was a dairy, which had some
farmland where we grew corn and beans for
[SPEAKER_02]: the cows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to go out every day and work in
the fields and make 11 cents an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at least be outside and get to work
out and play some softball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really after the first year,
when you're kind of done missing the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are on the outside,
like good food and your family and your
[SPEAKER_02]: friends, and you kind of get into a
routine in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like you forgot what's on the
outside, but I think we're pretty strong
[SPEAKER_02]: as humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we learned to adapt to the situation
and you get into your routines and you
[SPEAKER_02]: start looking forward to, hey,
on the weekends, I get to play softball
[SPEAKER_02]: and hey, I'm playing volleyball and
basketball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just occupy your time with doing
things that you like to do even in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do remember walking over to the
camp and I had the maximum time you can
[SPEAKER_02]: have to go to the prison camp is 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I got there, I had the longest
prison sentence out of anybody there for a
[SPEAKER_02]: first time nonviolent offender.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were looking at me going,
what, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You grew weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you had to have done something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just be here for a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because of that, they knew I wasn't
a rat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew I didn't cooperate in,
in rat off one of my friends and really
[SPEAKER_02]: gained a lot of respect from all ethnic
groups, blacks, whites, Hispanics,
[SPEAKER_02]: Asians.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them really accepted me with open
arms and, and really gave me a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: respect very quickly because of solely
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I felt pretty at home and they,
you know, they brought me over toothpaste
[SPEAKER_02]: and toothbrushes and kind of welcomed me
there and made it as really as good as
[SPEAKER_02]: could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's nice to hear that you're
able to sort of make the most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question that I always think
about whenever I'm contemplating either
[SPEAKER_00]: myself theoretically in jail or someone
else, as you describe, I have to imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: that there were points where you were
sitting there going, I can't wait to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to light up some fruit loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what was the strain that you were
thinking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, what were you having the,
the mirage dreams about smoking when you
[SPEAKER_00]: first got out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow-up, tell me about,
as you got closer to getting out,
[SPEAKER_00]: how did that all pan out?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, because I was in a camp,
you had the ability to get whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like visitors could drop it off in the
visiting room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That prison system was pretty corrupt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was pretty awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awful actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, but you were really in command of
your own destiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get in trouble there, you would
have to go to a higher security facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't mess around too much and,
uh, really was just playing sports,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get in the best shape I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, back then it was all about OG and sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we didn't have, and I didn't look
forward to the fruit loop so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I remember growing it with my
mom and, um, thought it was cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: but really there was a time in the
eighties and early nineties where it was
[SPEAKER_02]: all about OG and sour D and we were
getting $5,800 a pound, um, right before I
[SPEAKER_02]: went to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, I guess I was thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hearing stories of my friends really
doing pretty well in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: out, out here, which was a little bit hard
to hear at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we were in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, yeah, time went pretty fast
after a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 3000 days, the first year was
slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next little bit went fairly quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then six months before I got out,
like all of a sudden every day was like
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just slowed down because I could
finally see the light at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, I'm going to make it
out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so it really got really tense and
really slow and stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, finally made it out,
went to a halfway, a house and got home
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, really didn't smoke for,
for quite a while and didn't grow because
[SPEAKER_02]: I still was on, I got five years federal
probation, which didn't allow for you to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow at the time and did get released a
little bit early from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then immediately started growing my
two 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I want to share is what was
very odd to me at the time was I love
[SPEAKER_02]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a fishing guide on the river for
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I commercial fished with my, my parents
first, salmon, albacore and crab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the water and I love the
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got back, I didn't have that
drive that I remembered that I used to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to want to go do those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you don't do those things for
so long, you forget about what it is about
[SPEAKER_02]: those things that really made you get up
in the morning and want to do them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it really took me a minute even
with growing pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize what it was so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: About growing a plant that I love so much
until I put a few in and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, you know,
we had the two 15 error.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was able to grow a certain amount
once I was off probation and really just
[SPEAKER_02]: fell in love with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, very quickly, you know,
California was going to legalize cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and allow you to get permits and ended up
falling all back into that and was the
[SPEAKER_02]: fourth existing farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get a permit in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, ironically here I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of three farms in Humboldt County
to get a tourism permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take people here and I really,
it's not so much about the money for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about creating these strains,
honoring my mom that passed away when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was in jail, um, telling stories about not
Huckleberry hill farm so much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but all the Emerald triangle, small
farmers that have families and kids that
[SPEAKER_02]: are exactly like me that could have ended
up exactly like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's thousands of those people that
really just want to grow the best possible
[SPEAKER_02]: product they can and, and feel like just
energized and amazed to be able to share
[SPEAKER_02]: it with these consumers for the first time
in our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to have somebody after 45 years say
to you, excuse me, say to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, the white thorn rose made me feel
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I slept really good last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that validation is the reason why
we're doing what we're doing a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a powerful statement to be
able to give someone relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if, if nothing else in this
world to, to not have pain is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a noble thing you can grant someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's just so sad that we've been
lagging behind for so many years and that
[SPEAKER_00]: has, you know, sort of been on the table,
but for so many people not accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's beautiful to see,
you know, native passionate people like
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, bringing that to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many things you referenced,
you know, we'll have to loop back on so
[SPEAKER_00]: many of them, but I guess the first
question I'd love to ask is you started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the progression from planting
those few seeds, finding that spark again,
[SPEAKER_00]: to then starting your own breeding
journey?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, really it was dictated by my ability
to get my County permit, because once you
[SPEAKER_02]: were in the permitting process,
you know, the regulators would come here
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently and do their inspections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they were supposed to make sure you
have rainwater catchment ponds,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that all the, the, the sediment
wasn't flowing into the tributaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, there was all these rules and
regulations that now that we entered into
[SPEAKER_02]: the system, we had to follow and we were
getting checked up on all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, kind of started off slow,
but my farm here is permitted for 5,000
[SPEAKER_02]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of the smallest permitted farms in
the state of California, like one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger ones is 2.2 million square feet and
I'm 5,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like 500, 5,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how many times bigger
than mine, maybe 10,000 times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, so it's just my girlfriend
and I that are really here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I was saying before having grown
so long, um, I really found a big interest
[SPEAKER_02]: in breeding and creating different strains
and found that maybe a pathway forward for
[SPEAKER_02]: the small farmer wasn't ever going to be
to compete with big ag with all these gush
[SPEAKER_02]: mints and sour diesels and all these,
um, commercialized strains that they could
[SPEAKER_02]: easily get at commercial nurseries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe it was highlighting our legacy
strains that nobody else in the world had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I really just focused on,
you know, breeding different strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: which hundreds of them turned out to be
failures that I didn't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really evaluated them myself and what I
liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's what I really presented to the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, once the consumer got it in
their hands and they really, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: determined whether or not I would ever
grow it again by their feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I rely a lot on their feedback to
dictate what I grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we grow 90% of our farm is White
Thorn Road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, cause I won't give up the
other 10% because I want to experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: around and grow some of these little pheno
hunts that I'm running around trying and
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, and, um, gotten a lot of attention
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, feel pretty blessed being
able to do something I love and wake up
[SPEAKER_02]: every single morning and run on my front
door with a cup of coffee and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, tend the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're living the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically in terms of the,
the White Thorn Road, let's, let's delve
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we love to focus on genetics and
breeding here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess the first question is it's
made using some of those legacy strains
[SPEAKER_00]: you just referenced that are, you know,
native to yourself in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you working with seed stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did someone retain some clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was the first creation of White Thorn Road
a femme or a regular cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that was a, that's a very good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I guess a very important point
that I think I always leave out on most of
[SPEAKER_02]: the stories for there's just so much
information when I share that journey that
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of stuff gets left out and that's
one thing that I leave out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was gone and, you know,
I told you, I didn't rat on any of my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends, which if I would have,
I would have got no time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have to do any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they wanted me to cooperate with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how the federal government
worked, but it was the single most
[SPEAKER_02]: important decision I ever made in my life,
not to, to cooperate with the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really ensure, assure the people that
I grew up with that I am who I said I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in Humboldt County,
we were like one big family.
[SPEAKER_02]: We trusted one another with his,
with our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you break that trust, you never get
it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't ever broke that trust,
even when I got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I showed back up here,
um, after being gone for eight years,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had 50 people from this community here
to welcome me back, to bring me
[SPEAKER_02]: silverware, to bring me plates and
toothpaste and all those simple things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we took for granted that had gotten
stolen when I was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they all were here to
celebrate me and my return.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, just was really grateful for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people brought me over barbecues
and just brought me over everyday living
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was this one friend in
particular, his name was trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, trail was a really super good friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the friend that I was telling
you that my mom bred, um, her blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: kush to the lavender kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so trail came over and after being
that gone, uh, for that long, he had kept
[SPEAKER_02]: Froot Loops alive in his garage underneath
the light for me for eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he brought that mother plant back to
me after that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of giving me a barbecue,
he gave me this plant back that really was
[SPEAKER_02]: a reflection of my mom and what we
created.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, he really enabled this farm to be
what it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, by that kind of thoughtfulness and
that kind of generosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, just we'll never forget that
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, just to circle back a little bit,
I, you know, we're always talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and, and smoking different strains
and that amazingness of with all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, one of the little projects when
you and I first met a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: with the weed in the jar and the little,
uh, peat puck on the top really was trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to find a way to share with people the
validation that I felt from growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted people to understand that
starting a seed, growing it throughout its
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycle, harvesting it, drying it,
curing it, and then sharing it with your
[SPEAKER_02]: good friends and watching them smile and
alleviating their pain or their stress was
[SPEAKER_02]: really where all the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this breeding that I do here is,
is as much to find a new strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but is, is, is also part of trying to
encourage people to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nobody really needs to buy pot from
the retail shop and pay this ridiculous
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on a jar that you saw there,
which was a quarter ounce, I make $3.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell it for 65 at the retail store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want people to experience
growing their own because that's where the
[SPEAKER_02]: true magic is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many incredible points there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got to say shout out to trail
for hanging on to that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've held onto a clone for a buddy
for one year and that felt like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine eight that's shout out to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a good homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, so many incredible points you
touched on then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess the first question is,
tell me about when you, so you've made
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, the white thorn rose was,
was that a regular pollination and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell me about when you popped those
seeds and started to realize what magic
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd stumbled upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was in 2018 was the first
year I had grown the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I created those seeds, the lemon OG to the
paradise punch, um, in 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2018 was the first year I grew
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time I was putting some of my
product in the Willie's reserve jar,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Willie Nelson jar, and, um,
really having fun participating with that
[SPEAKER_02]: crew and learning about Willie Nelson and,
and having our stuff in his jar and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, ended up with maybe 15 different
plants, all a different variation because
[SPEAKER_02]: at that time we were still growing from
seed in the marketplace was a little
[SPEAKER_02]: hesitant because what happened was growing
from seed, every plant is a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not identical like growing from a
clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually the industry pushed back so
hard on that, that many of us grow from
[SPEAKER_02]: clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we make, we do pheno hunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make mother plants and then if we like
those, we, we grow like a bed of that or
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 plants of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least all the product looks exactly
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be going in the jar that
I'm calling white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what came about those 15 different
phenos of the white thorn rose was another
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that we renamed called mom's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people ask me, well, you got mom's weed
and you got white thorn rose and they both
[SPEAKER_02]: say it's a lemon OG cross with,
um, paradise punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you must've made a mistake,
but really it was just a different pheno
[SPEAKER_02]: of the same cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we liked them both so much that we
kept them both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you'll notice really quickly is
that all the names here are from seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that we named ourselves or strains we
named ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there, we have strains like a Malfi
cause we went to Italy and went to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Malfi coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We named one after my girlfriend's mom
that passed away when she was 48 called
[SPEAKER_02]: Margie's magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name was Margie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we had one that was called sweet
Marlene.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother was Marlene.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just named them what we
wanted to name them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then we really tried to educate
the consumer why we did that instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: really trying to let them dictate what
names were popular or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just did what we wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew what we wanted to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we shared it with them and really
found a little niche in what they liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I too do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've, I've actually got a few
phenotypes of the same cross and I give
[SPEAKER_00]: them slightly different names and people
always ask me, they're like, can't you
[SPEAKER_00]: just like color it down to the one that's
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, no, they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, that's why they're different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people, and some people love moms
weed better than they do white thorn rose
[SPEAKER_02]: and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's truly amazing to have watched
since 2018 white thorn rose to its
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution to today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really taken a life of its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's won like 20 different awards in the
Emerald Cup and, you know, with different
[SPEAKER_02]: products, with hash holes and vape pens
and rosin and resin and bubble hash and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and manufacturers are really having a
fun time experimenting around and creating
[SPEAKER_02]: different products with a strain they've
never seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really has given us a leg up in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the newest in the latest, I guess,
momentum that we've gotten with the right
[SPEAKER_02]: white thorn rose was when somebody that
had came and visited my farm here,
[SPEAKER_02]: took that white thorn rose back and shared
it with a comedian named Burt Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a pretty famous comedian out of
LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took it on one of his podcasts that
has like 3 million viewers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he started yelling,
this is the best strain in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, hundreds of people reached out
to me, where can I get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can I get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, next thing you know,
Tony Hawk smoking it and Tom Segura and
[SPEAKER_02]: all these famous people that I never even
had heard about until then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then we got invited to his
podcast, me, myself in Ridgeline Farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason, another award winning farm that I
really worked very closely with and grew
[SPEAKER_02]: up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of mutated since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have done a cross between his
award winning lamps and we cross it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Burt Kreischer is going to Fino hunt
this year at his house in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually did a mock up jar and we
hope that he's going to accept our
[SPEAKER_02]: proposal to sell a Burt Kreischer Fino
hunt of a strain that we're going to name
[SPEAKER_02]: after his nickname, the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're having fun doing what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if any of it makes any sense
or anything, but as long as we're having
[SPEAKER_02]: fun and enjoying life and living every day
to the fullest, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's what life's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, I feel like you must have a copy of
my questions because you just answered
[SPEAKER_00]: about 10 of them in one go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, no, you, you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a mind reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, a huge fan of your mom's house
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, anyone who watches it
would be aware Burt Kreischer,
[SPEAKER_00]: serial alcoholic, funny guy though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's, uh, hugely involved in the
mainstream comedian scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, I guess I was interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that connection initially happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gave him the white thorn rose that
started it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so, um, Burt's sister's, um,
boyfriend had come here with the gongy
[SPEAKER_02]: air, um, program and for a tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of every tour, I always
save a bunch of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and one of my highlights is sharing a
bunch of product with people that got to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear my story, got to hear, you know,
stories of people that are on the
[SPEAKER_02]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he went back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually shared it with Burt and
Burt fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he started seeking it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we went down to his podcast,
you know, we bought him, we brought tons
[SPEAKER_02]: of weed down to him and really hoping
that, um, kind of have it on the schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to come up here, um,
this summer and do a podcast on the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so just, yeah, just kind of riding the
wave and got to go to the Chelsea handler,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, comedy show a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I passed her off a bunch of white
thorns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she hasn't said anything about it,
but kind of exploring the comedian world
[SPEAKER_02]: there and getting a chance to share,
um, our story and our legacy sungrown
[SPEAKER_02]: strains with a whole different group of
consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, the amount of overlap between
the cannabis and the comedian scene is
[SPEAKER_00]: huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about it, not that
surprising, I guess the question I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was thinking about this appearance
on Burt cast, and I'd encourage everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what, do you feel like this is a sign
that we're becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream or do you think it was just a
lucky coincidence?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it's a lucky coincidence,
but I am a firm believer that everything
[SPEAKER_02]: happens for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I've always felt from the very
beginning that, that we were going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: something amazing and amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean by making a whole bunch of
money because money I know doesn't make
[SPEAKER_02]: people happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was taught that from the age of 10,
like never chase money because you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: never have enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always somebody that has more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will never make you happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always makes you feel hollow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it does make, you know,
paying the rent easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does make, you know, going to the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really friends, family,
and community that make you feel real and
[SPEAKER_02]: make you feel whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I still feel that same way today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what part or what role Bert
Kreischer is playing in really uplifting
[SPEAKER_02]: our community, um, or sharing with the
world, the story of the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_02]: small farmer and where a multi-billion
dollar industry was created.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I, I do feel like he has,
and he is going to play a bigger role in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in really helping share our story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, really grateful for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's yelled out a couple of times,
you know, Ridgeline Farms and Huckleberry
[SPEAKER_02]: Hill Farms on some of his comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, when, when he does that,
the response from people is always to
[SPEAKER_02]: reach out and DM us through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so just really grateful that he
even remembers to say it and that he's
[SPEAKER_02]: still smoking our weed and really want to,
uh, give him something really special and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and cool to, um, have fun with himself and
let him grow his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that, that will be epic to see what
comes from, from his little home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow earlier on in the answer,
you, you mentioned you were involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Willie Nelson crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had seen on your Instagram,
there was a number of photos and before
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd figured out sort of what was going on,
I was like, what's with the Willie Nelson
[SPEAKER_00]: obsession?
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little bit about how you got
involved with that crew and how your work
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up being in some of the jars of his
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started working really early with,
uh, a company that thought they were going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the world's largest sun grown
cannabis company and, uh, really went out
[SPEAKER_02]: and started building their brand by
representing small farmers of the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had five people in their company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when they first started in,
uh, when they finally went out of
[SPEAKER_02]: business, they had 300 people in their
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they ended up raising $300 million
in along that, um, four years before they
[SPEAKER_02]: lost it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they brought out on brands like the
Willie's reserve, which, uh, really
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporated Willie Nelson and is his
ideals in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that team would come up
here, not Willie himself, but he is
[SPEAKER_02]: Willie, the, the reserve team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would look at all the flower and
then the different farms that they went
[SPEAKER_02]: to, they would decide what flower they
wanted Willie Nelson to actually taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would bring a little bit
back to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Willie would taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the chief tasting officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, he would decide
what flower ended up going into his jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first year we grew legally,
he picked three out of our four strains
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, you know, got to go to some of
his concert, got to go backstage and just
[SPEAKER_02]: really admire that man for kind of the
little bit that I know of him and what he
[SPEAKER_02]: went through and just his life journey
really was just truly amazing and hearing
[SPEAKER_02]: some of his stories and what he's been
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, just really respect that person a
very lot and was happy to participate in
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the small amount of time that I was
with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our product also was introduced,
uh, first year in 2018 at the Oscars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the biggest stars in the world,
it was in the gift bags, the Huckleberry
[SPEAKER_02]: Hill joint and, you know, Denzel
Washington, Meryl Streep and all them got
[SPEAKER_02]: to smoke a Huckleberry joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they never admitted it and they never
showed it, but it was in their gift bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they gave it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely a strain that was bred
to the paradise punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure which one it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we called it Huckleberries,
but, um, it was, it was definitely bred to
[SPEAKER_02]: paradise punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're on the topic of awards,
you know, you, you touched on it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been picking up awards left,
right, and center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to go over it last night
quickly, and I might've missed a few,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you've won awards for your flower,
your bubble hash, your concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: your pre-rolls, your vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said many of these, but I just wanted
to verify you weren't, you weren't being
[SPEAKER_00]: facetious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've actually won awards for all of
those categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question is what's the key?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people can pick up awards in
flower cause maybe the strain is good as a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, but it's often not as good as a
concentrate, but it seems like your stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is just nailing it across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do you rationale it's been so
successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the grow style?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you attribute it to?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing to recognize because a
lot of times either a strain is really
[SPEAKER_02]: good for, for rosin or it's really good
for flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very rarely I've been told that you
find something that's good for both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and that happens to be what
white thorn rose really does fulfill is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is being both demand, huge demand for
flower and rosin and all the other
[SPEAKER_02]: different byproducts that are made from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it has a lot to do with the
cultivar and those legacy strains for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't also want to take away
anything from the way a farmer grows that
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's all about the TLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't dump liquid fertilizer into a,
into a tank and, and watered and usually
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all stuff really from the forest
around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not, you know, white thorn or
white thorn bush mulch or a Manzanita
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch or, um, you know, I, I do a lot of
top dressing with dr earth four,
[SPEAKER_02]: four, four, you know, everything's
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is kind of natural,
but I really liked the idea of top
[SPEAKER_02]: dressing on a plant with, you know,
like a dry amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much every time, and I,
I, I do have drippers on all the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I hand water every morning,
usually in the middle of the summer,
[SPEAKER_02]: just because some need more water and some
need less water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to have that ability,
not just to turn the water on and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything gets the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have the ability to say,
okay, this one looks pretty wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might want to skip this one this time
and let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but anyways, every time you water
really, um, you're watering in just a
[SPEAKER_02]: small amount of a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not getting this huge
concentration of this big green synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer is getting all natural,
consistent, every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the plants just respond to
that better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really want my flower, good or bad
to really taste like the place that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've, I've shared some of my
genetics, like mom's weed, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: moon made farms over on the East side of
the County, who is somebody that I respect
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, her mom's weed tastes totally
different than my mom's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks fairly similar, but it,
it does definitely taste different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, Ridgeline grows a few of my
strains and Canada country and hogwash
[SPEAKER_02]: farms, and they're all really good
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it tastes different from the
places I get a little influence,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little fog from the ocean that comes
over the Hills, where maybe the East side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the County doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all these different things that
really are attributed to the terroir is
[SPEAKER_02]: what really affects the taste along with,
you know, the way you nurture and take
[SPEAKER_02]: care of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, I forgot what your question
was, but, um, it's really a combination of
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I always tell the consumer,
know your farmer, know how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating, really know who they are
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know if they support to veterans and
donate to get compassionate care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, if you're looking for
something that's going to make you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, that's going to be good for you,
that maybe has some healing properties
[SPEAKER_02]: that can make an ailment that you have go
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of want to know the doctor that's
working on your, you right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know, who's farming your stuff
if you want to feel the best possible way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So knowing your farmer is the most and the
best advice I can give to any consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you know where it's coming
from, it'll, it'll make every follow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: question all that much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just realized, you know,
we're talking so much about the white
[SPEAKER_00]: thorn rose, but there's probably some
people out there, especially those outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the USA who have probably never had a
chance to try it themselves just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as a, as a general, sort of
example, how, how would you describe it
[SPEAKER_00]: for someone who's never had it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I first smelled it,
I thought, Oh, this is like a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex version of forbidden fruit,
like real tropical fruit explosion,
[SPEAKER_00]: really gorgeous sort of fruity smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe it to someone who
hasn't encountered it yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's been explained to me
like words, like kind of grape fruity,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a tinge of grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the one that I guess one of the things
that I noticed right off when I smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: white thorn rose and really went,
Whoa, this is, this is something cool is
[SPEAKER_02]: really the flavor of that joint all the
way down to the very last hit tasted
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like, Oh, half the joint tasted
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rest tasted sort of shabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just tasted really good, really fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could put it down and pick it up and it
still tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what's lingered with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and most people describe it as
something just that they haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced before something so unique and
different in just, uh, in combination with
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing the story of this place and how it
came to be maybe affects the way people
[SPEAKER_02]: really enjoy it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so knowing the story really before you
smoke it really enables you after you
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked a little bit to really imagine the
journey that we've been on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, we've heard a lot about how it
really thrives outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the majority of our listeners,
I think are probably more indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: orientated.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it perform indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Never tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anybody that's ever tried it
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was, that's curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, there was several indoor
operators that have reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some big giant companies that
have reached out to me to want to license
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, most of them want to license it so
they can take it down to Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: California, grow it more commercially,
like with tractors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, I always tried to
explain to these bigger companies that it
[SPEAKER_02]: won't be the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to taste the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that you think you love about it
and the reason you want it so much won't
[SPEAKER_02]: be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll probably be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and that's a little bit of a hindrance
as a, as a, such a small farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's really a limited amount of it that
we're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I just expanded and let,
uh, hogwash farms grow it on his farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow really similar, same inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always coming over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like an extension of
Huckleberry Hill over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he's another grower that really
just is very passionate about what he
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I felt okay doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've even smoked his and I can't tell
the difference between his or mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, so we're just trying to
figure out how to navigate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to navigate this business and really
make it work for a lot of people and get
[SPEAKER_02]: it into as many consumer hands as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, the challenges of scaling up is
something we talk with many guests about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You referenced a few different,
um, you know, really fantastically
[SPEAKER_00]: reputable, uh, collaborators in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one I wanted to touch on for sure
is Ridgeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, you know, they're
extremely well known in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think almost every time I've been to the
Emerald Cup, they've come first,
[SPEAKER_00]: second or third in multiple categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absolutely crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this friendship first start and
how did it evolve into the collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: you're moving into now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up with Jason, who's Ridgeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it was always kind of a little
battle between we're on the west side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the county and he's on the east side of
the county.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of the west side of this
hill country versus the east side and who
[SPEAKER_02]: could grow more and who had the better
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was always a friendly competition,
not only growing weed, but with fishing,
[SPEAKER_02]: like when we had our boats out in the
ocean, who caught the biggest fish or who
[SPEAKER_02]: caught the most fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, once we went legal and we got a
little bit older, um, we just really
[SPEAKER_02]: started, we're relying on one another to
try to navigate the legal market and how
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to run a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he's just a really kind person,
good heart, um, good human being,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and our value system is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just isn't really about,
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not really about the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's about, you know, making people happy
and, and, you know, having fun doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: because we only go around once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were very fortunate to work
really closely with together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very fortunate to have won a lot of
awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I'm just as happy for him,
to win an award as I am for myself to win
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think it's vice versa too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely try some of his
legacy strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a second generation cannabis
farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew with his dad and his dad was,
was hauled off one year in a camp
[SPEAKER_02]: helicopter during a raid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was coming home on a school bus
and, you know, he watched his dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He heard his house was getting raided and
his dad, you know, was hauled away in a,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a helicopter.
[SPEAKER_02]: With, you know, AR 15s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that kind of stuff is traumatizing
and at the same time, very, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: bonding to those people that are,
um, that, that have gone through that with
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, we have that much in common
and, um, really trust each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's so interesting to hear you
have that common sort of experience as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a young person being really affected by
those, those raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess just to follow up,
you know, you've got this new collab
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going down with the Lance and the
White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about what sort of
things people might expect to find in
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds if they're interested in
grabbing some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, they're going to need to know
that it might be a while because we
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't offered those particular seeds to
the public yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, we, we both work with the
same seed company, the TangledRootStore
[SPEAKER_02]: .com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he has released, you know,
some award-winning genetics like the Green
[SPEAKER_02]: Lantern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think his Ridgeline Runts that won
Emerald Cup, um, are on that site,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I have a couple of creations
that I released.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but really we want to grow and
experiment around with all these new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains for multiple years before we,
you know, torture somebody's harvest by
[SPEAKER_02]: giving them something that turns out
terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still in the evolution process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bert's going to be part of that process in
pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's four or five different phenos
of the machine of the Lance White Thorn
[SPEAKER_02]: Rose that we're trying to evaluate to see
which one we like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately at the end of the day,
if, if Bert wants to participate,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's going to be the one that really
chooses the one that's going to go in the
[SPEAKER_02]: jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there'll be a limited amount of jars
and, um, yeah, it'll be something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's really purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's really fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, have we haven't tested it,
you know, in the California labs yet to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to really know how it tests out,
but, uh, yeah, pretty excited and having
[SPEAKER_02]: fun with it nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll all have to watch and keep an
eye on it to see when it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just mentioned something which
really, uh, got my brain going,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is you mentioned, you know,
it's fruity, it's purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what people like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interested to hear the thoughts of
our guests about what they feel are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the necessary components to make a
strain popular these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the most recent guests we've
had on have all pretty unanimously said
[SPEAKER_00]: that they feel like, uh, for something to
be really commercially popular at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment has to have a degree of purple to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the past that had fallen off,
you know, we went through the purple age
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it's coming back a bit in
your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the components that you
think need to be there to hit that current
[SPEAKER_00]: popular market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, definitely needs to be purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like purple is in like, it could be gone
next year, but this year it is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost the first question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, purple and gassy is really a
popular thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, even though I, most of my strains
aren't gassy, a lot of Ridgeline strains
[SPEAKER_02]: are a little bit more on the gassy side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but what, what, what, to be honest,
what has really happened over the last
[SPEAKER_02]: six, seven, eight years with both
Ridgeline and Huckleberry Hill and even
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada country and hogwash farms is those
consumers have really built a trust system
[SPEAKER_02]: with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it almost doesn't matter if it's
green, purple, gassy, fruity, whatever we
[SPEAKER_02]: put in their jars, they know has really
gone through our evaluation system or
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they have resonated with and maybe
liked if they continue to purchase our
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't matter what we put in,
in our jars so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what, what is really important for
consumers to know is it's at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day, really up to them, what makes
them feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you ever run into a farmer that
says, I grow the best, that's when you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to run because what makes me feel
good might not make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our endocannabinoid system is made up
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So terpenes and cannabinoids and the
cannabis plants are going to affect each
[SPEAKER_02]: one of us totally different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can never say, Hey, white thorn rose
is the best, but I can say white thorn
[SPEAKER_02]: rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have had amazing
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that doesn't work, maybe pick up
some Ridgeline because we're circling back
[SPEAKER_02]: to knowing your farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really the most important thing to
know is how they cultivated the product
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're about to put in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really that's the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you go to know how it's grown and you
know, I forgot to mention earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a diehard organic sky myself as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's beautiful to hear that's how you
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, when, when brands like
yourself are just so highly prized by the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer base, it can actually be almost
hard for people to get their hands on the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of reach does your product have
at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fairly limited because there is such
high demand in the local area or what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts on your reach at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very, it is very limited in how far
south that it kind of is able to reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: More so just because I work with a kid,
Chris Anderson with Redwood roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: who started a distribution company in the
state of California makes us go through
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution companies to sell the retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to work with somebody that I
trusted somebody that I grew up with and
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris is that that person and he has like
three people in his company.
[SPEAKER_02]: He only has the ability to, you know,
drive the van down to LA once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't even really make it to San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are companies like Nabas that give
the farmer the ability to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pay monthly fees and to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll deliver anywhere in California
within a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm trying to give Chris with Redwood
roots, the opportunity to, to figure it
[SPEAKER_02]: all out and to kind of be on the journey
with us and, or us be on the journey with
[SPEAKER_02]: him and, and figure it out together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, we, we sell out all of our
product all luckily every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, a lot of people in San
Diego and a little bit in LA don't get a
[SPEAKER_02]: chance to get it unless they come north.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's a testament and it's
almost like a good for brand promotion
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, I'm sure you've learned
this yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if people have to work hard to get it,
they're going to value it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone from LA driving up your way,
I'm sure they're just going to be riding
[SPEAKER_00]: high the whole way home because it just
makes it that little bit extra sweet that
[SPEAKER_00]: they put the effort in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to loop back to your breeding
just for a moment and just talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about like the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, we've mentioned the,
the collaboration with Ridgeline runs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to know what's, what's your
sort of vision moving forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the genetics and as a quick follow
up, is there any new genetics or just
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you've seen recently that
you're thinking, Oh, I wouldn't mind
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating that into some of my lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did this last year,
I did a few different collaborations like
[SPEAKER_02]: the one with Ridgeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also did a project with, you know,
everybody wants to participate luckily
[SPEAKER_02]: with the White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm pretty selective on,
you know, who those people are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's usually people that I
grew up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those people's is, is Ted Blair
with Canna Country Farms, who also has a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of award winning cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them that only test 16%,
like the Canna Country 26 has won quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: few awards do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had smoked some of his Canna
Country 38 and all his are numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he doesn't want to give them names
until he, Vino hunts the ones out that are
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he'll name them different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So currently, we're all just on numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Canna Country 38 was one that I tried
last year, something that he bred his
[SPEAKER_02]: place that I don't even actually know the
cross with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he brought me over some pollen last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we bred it to the White Thorn,
the White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did a little Fino hunt in my garage
this this winter with along with
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridgeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really amazing one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to call that
country rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like the sun or the song.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, Canna Country Country
Rose and thought that was an amazing name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if if Bert doesn't end up naming or
want to participate with the machine,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to name that Ridgeline Rose
and just put the same product in a
[SPEAKER_02]: different, you know, with a different
name, because we think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, for this year, I don't have
any big plans this year yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to cross the White Thorn Rose
with the Canna Country
[SPEAKER_02]: 26.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, I guess we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always we always kind of midseason
after we get everything planted,
[SPEAKER_02]: then focus our attention on, OK,
what am I going to get and what am I going
[SPEAKER_02]: to breed to?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a lot of demand for the
White Thorn Rose that we cross with RS 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold out on all those seeds within like
three or four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never even grew any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't even know they could all be
winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably I'll do that one again,
maybe keep a few for myself to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't I'm not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't pivoted to being in that mental
state yet to figure out what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: cross, but going to definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as like a bit of an extension of that
and referencing what you just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed on sites that that sell your
seeds, there was actually a nice variation
[SPEAKER_00]: of crosses there, and there was ones like,
you know, that use the mum's weed and a
[SPEAKER_00]: few other of those legacy strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you just referenced, there was also
some really modern stuff like some RS 11
[SPEAKER_00]: cross White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, is this a conscious
decision to do a bit of both or does it
[SPEAKER_00]: just happen to work out that way that you
do a bit of the hype stuff, a bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing a little bit of the hype stuff
because I got some of those those clones
[SPEAKER_02]: from friends of mine that were growing
those commercial strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they always had extras.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, hey, give me one of those RS
11 or give me one of this or give me one
[SPEAKER_02]: of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also had, you know,
some leftover mom's weed that I was able
[SPEAKER_02]: to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of was second guessing myself on,
was that the right move to let the the
[SPEAKER_02]: mom's weed cross with Paradise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's a winner in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody is going to have to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody is going to have to hunt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really having a great time sharing
that journey of other people that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feno hunting my strains that I haven't
even grown before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there is one that we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a little feno hunt last year of the
Paradise Pine that we did release to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been watching this guy that I
don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been showing me all the different
phenos that he has growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some just amazing ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and we actually cherry picked a couple
really good and amazing Paradise Pine here
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're doing some rosin with entered
it into the Emerald Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a company named I Poppy, who that
really takes a lot of pride in what they
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they always use a lot of our white
thorn rose, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep an eye out for Paradise Pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a sneaker that's going to
be another staple cultivar here that we
[SPEAKER_02]: grow at Huckleberry and in hogwash farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year I actually am sharing some
of those genetics with another really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really good farmer called Mattole
Sun Grown and Mattole Valley Sun Grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's Dylan Mattole.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been out it over the mountain for 50
years on that same piece of property.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check him out to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows amazing stuff and really good
guy, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that that's awesome to hear Paradise
Pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone, keep your eyes out for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's going to creep up while we're on
the topic of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just quickly throw it out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you much of a sativa guy yourself or
you more just into the Indicas?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I prefer actually like, you know,
most of the strains that we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: nowadays are like hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's a little this and a
little that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but the Margie's Magic is a really
cool strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of like a sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really enjoy that from time to time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, got that really cool
aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of like a Jack Herrera Blue
Dreamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I either find that people really love
Margie's Magic or they're just like really
[SPEAKER_02]: burnt out on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was a strain that was more in
the 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really something that we just we
did so much of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of overwhelmed people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't even want it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of my friends say, oh,
that's the charity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we know we're doing we don't want any
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the retail, the consumers at
the retail level really love Margie's
[SPEAKER_02]: Magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we grow we grow 15 pounds of that a
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it in a thousand different quarter
jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all we do a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do too little.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just that that's a staple thousand
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've you've just reminded me because,
you know, you reference how that one's
[SPEAKER_00]: been around for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just quickly loop back to when
you were younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned your early experiences with
cannabis helping your parents in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and sort of having that really
organic introduction to it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to ask you, what was the first
strain you ever actually smoked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it one of the ones you're working with
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just one of the ones back then?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was one called Fruit Loops that
my original the one, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my mom was Catholic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she was even though we grew pot,
she was her her parents were really
[SPEAKER_02]: straight and, you know, really strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though she wasn't super strict
and we moved up to the country and did our
[SPEAKER_02]: own thing, you know, I didn't really drink
in front of her and I didn't smoke in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, every so often,
maybe I, you know, if a bud fell off one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plants into my hand and,
you know, I took it to a party or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what I first experiment
experimented around with was with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruit Loop strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool that you're still smoking
on, you know, the strain that you first
[SPEAKER_00]: ever puffed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess as a curiosity, we talk about this
idea of like genetic deterioration over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed any difference in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You read my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, yeah, I think there was one point
that I did notice a little deterioration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if maybe, you know,
there's things called russet mites and
[SPEAKER_02]: broad mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they have a hop late and viral or
viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, even though I've been able
to avoid a lot of that stuff, because all
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetic, I don't really take genetics
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except maybe an RS 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was one year I took one strain
in that I did some breeding with that
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe I introduced something that maybe
affected some of my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did start, I had some paradise
punch seeds and I did restart a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch and I phenohunted one that I thought
was exactly the same and kind of started
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, I think I ended up with the
better end of the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that after that long, of cutting
off those that's the not the same mother,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm always making new mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think there was some kind of
deterioration and I haven't explored too
[SPEAKER_02]: much around with doing like tissue
cultures, which I heard can revitalize
[SPEAKER_02]: that and and help with that and don't know
a whole lot about that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but I'm really happy with where
they're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the genetics are still
really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I'll have to explore that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always have these seeds of of kind
of those genetics and I could always
[SPEAKER_02]: re-phenohunt something real similar or
something that I really like.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we've spoke to many guests who have
done similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they make some S1s and re-hunt
something from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly an issue people
encounter when you when you're maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics for such a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit curious and you may not
know the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did your parents ever talk to you about
where they got the genetics from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they must have been getting some
of the early stuff, I imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we moved here, you know,
we got some of those genetics from our
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there was all this
variation of different there was like so
[SPEAKER_02]: many different phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, my mom found one that she
liked and don't exactly really know where
[SPEAKER_02]: it kind of came from or who our neighbors
got it from, but ended up with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ended up being pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of utilized that and then
named kind of considered it ours after a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is one other genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We called it the the number 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one when my dad was out
partying pretty hard and I was a really
[SPEAKER_02]: young kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had taken me to a friend of his place
and they were rolling up a joint and a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed had rolled out of the rolling tray
into the bottom of this box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really I think I was like nine
or 10 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had picked up that seed and put it
in my pocket and took it home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we started it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom said, oh, yeah, we'll try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ended up being amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we made a bunch of seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And long story short, I still have like
Trell ended up remodeling his house in in
[SPEAKER_02]: the wall of his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: He found a bunch of those 21 seeds that I
had given him 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he gave those back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried every different technique to
try to get one to pop, get one to sprout.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like maybe 15 of those left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not wanting to keep trying because I had
so many failures of so many like waiting
[SPEAKER_02]: for somebody to have some kind of new
advanced technology that can scoop the
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue out of it and and revitalize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember that as a kid just being
another amazing, just great strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping somebody either has some
knowledge that I don't yet or can steer me
[SPEAKER_02]: in the right direction or something
develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a there's a lot of people
waiting for that sort of what do they call
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The the artificial embryo to sort of come
out and to to help bring back some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: killer old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, kudos for you to
recognizing that we just need to hang on
[SPEAKER_00]: to these last ones and wait till we get
the right technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we fast forward back to sort of the
modern era from, you know, having a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a reflection on the past, I'd love to ask
you a lot of the guests who come on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, talk about how over the past,
say, five or more years, there's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: big market shift for people wanting almost
exclusively feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk to growers, do you notice
any clear preference over regular versus
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you yourself, do you have any
preference?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do, you know, with the little seed
business do see a greater demand for
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds, just because typically I
think people that don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, it just eliminates a step for
them from making a mistake, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They know it's a female, they can do it,
but it also, for my friends, none of us
[SPEAKER_02]: grow feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little bit, it can, I should,
let me say this differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be a little bit unstable,
and they can shoot out a little male
[SPEAKER_02]: flower here or there, or have had some
little disasters happen with feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds before, so none of us really grow
our whole crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might grow one or two feminized seeds,
and there are some breeders like Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed Company that really has done a lot of
experimenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nat and Hallie have done experiments with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've tried that a lot more and have
refined it to really isolate some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: stable or genetics where they're pretty
successful at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've graduated to that
point, and I would really hate to ruin
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody's crop, so the only feminized
seeds that I do are ones that I've played
[SPEAKER_02]: around with, that I feel very comfortable
with, but I still don't really grow those
[SPEAKER_02]: or too many of those on my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's understandable, and as a
follow-up, I love to ask all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: guests, without being able to know
anything about the grower, because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that the intuitive answer is, oh,
I'd want to talk to them a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you could only recommend one of
your strains to someone and just think,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, this is an all-rounder, most people
are going to be really happy with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: To grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paradise pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paradise pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing two of the very exact seeds
that I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not greedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want people to grow amazing strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something that's better than white
thorn rose in those paradise pine seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoked the rosin that was made out
of the paradise pine, I had believed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and because the Emerald Cup got pushed
back, that paradise pine rosin from iPoppy
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to dethrone the white thorn
rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very unique flavor, and I have
Fino hunted the very one that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a pretty good yielder for the
manufacturer, so they're pretty happy with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got really high hopes for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: White thorn rose seems like it will always
have a place here on this farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some people's favorite strain ever,
and they have said such kind words to me
[SPEAKER_02]: that I would never not want to have it
here to offer to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just a reflection of my mother
and her kindness and really who she was as
[SPEAKER_02]: a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very honored to have that and feel
lucky that I stumbled upon it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I probably don't really truly deserve
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think you deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put in the hard yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've sacrificed part of your life for
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's no doubt you deserve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to follow up, you mentioned that
you smoked the rosin, and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: signified to you that we're ushering in a
new era almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how memorable that was for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the growing feeling that
concentrates are going to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate the market in terms of what
people are looking to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question for you is, is that something
you're thinking, and will you be
[SPEAKER_00]: considerate of that going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think, I'm just going to keep
breeding the way I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it happens to work well for
concentrates, that's great, but not the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really truly breeding for concentrates
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% of my farm goes to concentrates,
but 90% of my farm is split up between
[SPEAKER_02]: eight to 10 manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year, it'll be split up between 10 to
15 because I like to see their different
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what that creates for me,
the ability to get it to more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flour that I do grow here will be
flour that I put in my jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I fear for most people with
concentrates is that I think the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: as a whole is utilizing concentrates to
really get rid of their subpar product
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can transform it into a
product that maybe is not well formed into
[SPEAKER_02]: a flour that can be put into a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make it into a concentrate and it
all looks the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we do concentrate, especially with
the white thorn rose here, we do whole
[SPEAKER_02]: plant concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm selling our fresh frozen to
manufacturers, I harvest the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get everything because I want that
rosin or that bubble hash or whatever to
[SPEAKER_02]: be the best that it can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what truly affects that,
so I don't want to take the chance and
[SPEAKER_02]: have any kind of negative effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go and top all my plants and then
give all the lower stuff to the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the whole plant and they can take
part in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be here and do it with me however
they want or they see it when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: washing it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they all appreciate it and I think
it does end up being a better product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, I don't know how well the
consumer can tell the difference,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think there's a fine line between
really good flour and flour that's okay
[SPEAKER_02]: and the same with rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of manufacturers are trying
to drive that price point down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep the white thorn rose at 135 flat
rate per pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of companies are trying
to... There's slim margins out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: so if they can find some subpar stuff for
$50 a pound or $40 a pound, maybe that's
[SPEAKER_02]: more beneficial for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't worked with those kind of
people because that can't help my farm
[SPEAKER_02]: survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just are the higher end, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to loop back and talk about the
pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go there, I just want to quickly
ask, the discussion around indoor versus
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor cannabis has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the longest time, it was always indoor
supreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, I feel like there's a lot
more credence given to the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor can produce a much more shelf
stable product in the long run as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: arguably a superior terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you rationalize the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you explain it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone who said, oh, I don't really
know that much about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between indoor and
outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would your answer be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the same reason you don't buy your
vegetables that are grown underneath
[SPEAKER_02]: artificial light is the same reason you
shouldn't buy your cannabis grown
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath artificial light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown a lot of indoor in the
traditional days when I was younger to
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid the helicopters and avoid
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was some amazing indoor back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I know now is from doing experiments
with Columbia University and really
[SPEAKER_02]: identifying the different terpene profiles
from indoor and outdoor, really
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding that the heads are a lot
thicker grown outdoor because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: subjected to the wind, the rain,
the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that influence from the
weather, those terpenes are able to last
[SPEAKER_02]: longer in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a thicker wall around them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot the name of the actual wall
around the terpene head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just learned a lot about the difference
between sungrown and outdoor through
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia University and the different
cannabinoids and learned that a lot of us
[SPEAKER_02]: are relying on these testing labs that
test for maybe 20 or 25 terpenes because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what the standards are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they have to test for by the
state's standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through Columbia University, I learned
that White Thorn Rose had 444 different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never even knew of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had over 60 different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was 35 to 40 different terpenes that
were never tested for.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found out was that I kept
wondering how White Thorn Rose can be so
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing and smell and taste so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terpene percentages was always coming
back 1.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because they're only testing for
certain terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, White Thorn Rose has certain
terpenes that aren't even tested for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works negatively against with the
California labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I found out it had 60 different
terpenes, especially one called Salina
[SPEAKER_02]: diene that really has some ability to cure
a lot of different ailments, really made a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have smoked a lot of cannabis and
now we're hearing people like Berner from
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies who was strictly about indoor
cannabis starting to really highlight and
[SPEAKER_02]: work with legacy farmers with outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He works with Ridgeline now with his lamps
and really just had him here at my farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had him not on video saying it,
but he said sun groans way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entourage effect, the amount of how
long that entourage effects last,
[SPEAKER_02]: lasts a lot longer smoking outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll affect each one of us a lot
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like you were saying before,
the consumer is slowly starting to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out that even though it's not this rock
hard tight OG bud that we were always
[SPEAKER_02]: educated that that's what determines it
being the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little fluffier and it might be
a little bit shaggy or looks a little
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can still make you feel amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always encourage people to smoke
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool to hear that as the
kids say, Uncle Berne was around the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to ask, because you
mentioned talking about the labs giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you these terpene readings of like 1.5%
and terpene percentages have become such a
[SPEAKER_00]: focal point of what buyers base their
purchasing decisions off these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, the same is said for THC
percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the future of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like although it hasn't started
yet, I feel like we're getting close to a
[SPEAKER_00]: point where people are going to start to
accept that the numbers they see for
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes or THC content is not necessarily
the entire story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see us in regards to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they are figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're also figuring out that
the labs are pretty inaccurate and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing stuff like seven, 10 labs tested
from the same batch, their flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I think the THC levels varied
from 14% to like 25 or 26%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how inconsistent the labs are
because what happens is that the labs
[SPEAKER_02]: really only have the ability to make their
business work if they generate tests from
[SPEAKER_02]: the distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they continually give low THC
scores, it really makes it hard for those
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll switch labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, it behooves the labs to
give those farmers higher THC scores,
[SPEAKER_02]: because then you go back to them and you
use them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can generate a lot of business
by continually just turning the dial up a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, probably 90% of
the people can't tell the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's my belief that the
consumers starting to understand that the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profile and the terpenes and the
THC and the cannabinoids together really
[SPEAKER_02]: give you different entourage effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a little bit more complicated
than reading, you know, a number on a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think once they experiment around
with enough strains and comes back to
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing your farmer again, they're
figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably not as fast as I had hoped,
but yeah, they're figuring out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know certainly some of the,
the older strains may not produce quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: high numbers as some of the more modern
ones, but are still able to stand up side
[SPEAKER_00]: by side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to interrupt you, but what really ends
up hurting the, the educational process
[SPEAKER_02]: are things like the state fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a ambassador with the state fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to try not to say
anything too negatively about the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way they're going about it,
but as they're developing, developing and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to educate people, they're,
they're not really helping the cause
[SPEAKER_02]: because, um, you know, they're,
they're basing their awards on a COA test
[SPEAKER_02]: that's done by a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're saying things like,
um, this is, these are the best growers in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, or this is the best flower in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're, you're coming up with that
conclusion by a lab test that we already
[SPEAKER_02]: know is completely inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I've been pushing back to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, any contest out there
has to be, you know, they have to touch
[SPEAKER_02]: and feel and, and experience the flower or
the rosin or the gummy or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, they're, they're, you know,
entering the contest with, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I I'm having a little issue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, look, I, I too would take issue,
especially as we just said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: given the variation that seven 10 pointed
out, is it even within their own metric of
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're grading things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it even accurate by the way they think
they're marking it, which may not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily be the case, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then you get into the,
the more minute details of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, let's just say it all is getting
tested by the one company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some amount of standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, it usually comes down to the way
the individual technician processes the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud sample and then loads it into the
HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is like, you know,
a bit of a quagmire to wander into,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think, I think we are, we're both
pretty much on the same page that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: should be more about effect and how it
makes you feel than, than any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you said something really quite
profound a little earlier on, and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to loop back and I wanted to talk a little
bit about you within the marketplace as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a medium slash small to medium
size farm and how you're able to still be
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess the first thing I'd say is,
you know, you mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were the fourth existing farm in
Humboldt County to be fully permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that process like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, was it, was it really difficult
and how many hoops did you have to jump
[SPEAKER_00]: through?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse my language, but it was hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's hell for a lot of my fellow
farmers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're talking about a bunch of
regulators that know nothing about weed
[SPEAKER_02]: that really are trying to capitalize on
the marketplace that we built in the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional era.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they're learning, as they're going,
it's been brutally painful for many of us
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance wise to, to, to bow down to
some of the things they're asking us to
[SPEAKER_02]: do, like weigh every plant wet and then
weigh every plant dry, and then keep track
[SPEAKER_02]: of all the waste on that plant and then
reweigh the flower and then keep track of
[SPEAKER_02]: the trim off of that flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like they're making us do so much work
because they think they have the ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep track of something we can waste
out in one, one click of a key on the
[SPEAKER_02]: keyboard and say it molded.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no ability to control what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they should really give into working
with us instead of trying to control us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where they're making a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and we do take, do some educational
tours with the DC who's a regulating body
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, they always are very
nice people that work in the industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: they seem genuine and want to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, man, it's just so slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything they do and yeah, they agree
with us, but they just take years before
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually act on what they know to be
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I just try to take it with the
grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a small enough farm where tagging
every plant isn't a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs, uh, you know, cost a fortune,
you know, for many of us to put in
[SPEAKER_02]: rainwater catchment ponds, to fix our
roads, to fix our ditches, to change out
[SPEAKER_02]: culverts, um, and to do a lot of things
that they were thinking was helpful,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that now they think isn't help didn't
need to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they have, uh, like moon
made farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about her farm was logged in
the eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when part of her permitting process,
she has to change out 25 culverts on a
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of property that was, um,
that she bought in the two thousands that
[SPEAKER_02]: really was logged in the eighties that all
these culverts were put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like these are roads that are never
used, but since they have the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The properties, once they're in the
process, they're really trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, punish us still,
or I'm not sure what, what they're gaining
[SPEAKER_02]: or what the benefits are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they're really destroying the whole
cannabis is the California cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry is quickly failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're starting to realize that now
most of the small farmers are,
[SPEAKER_02]: are really struggling and you know,
they're, they're not making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, you know, if they're,
if they're still around, they're maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking even or surviving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, a lot of my friends are
going, going away, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's touch on that in just a second,
but you actually made a really profound
[SPEAKER_00]: comment there about how the regulatory
bodies are worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make, you know,
a bunch of the crop disappear and say it
[SPEAKER_00]: molded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting to hear that
because I think a lot of the discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: around that issue is actually far more
targeted towards the massive like
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-state operations and the people I
talk to have the suspicion that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower that is subpar or is just
excess from some of these big like
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-state operations ends up in these
black market, you know, New York little
[SPEAKER_00]: bodega being sold on the corner sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what they think is where all
that supply is coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any suspicions about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you feel like the regulatory bodies
are targeting the wrong people if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about you doing it when really
there's 10 million hectare farms and
[SPEAKER_00]: seemingly all their product just,
you know, it's not leftover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where 90% of the weed goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you, if, if you're not
participating in that market, and I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: saying anybody does, but if, if you're
not, you're not making it in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's, it's in my opinion that
they understand that it's happening since
[SPEAKER_02]: there's only enough retail stores that
they've given licenses to.
[SPEAKER_02]: To really distribute two to 3 million
pounds in packaging, but yet they've
[SPEAKER_02]: permitted enough farms to produce 15
million pounds this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do they think the other 13,
12 or 13 million pounds are going to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: They know there's nowhere it can't go
anywhere and you can't lose that much as a
[SPEAKER_02]: business or you would be out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they understand that it's
happening and I think they're being very
[SPEAKER_02]: lenient about that now, because if they
enforce too hard on it, the whole industry
[SPEAKER_02]: goes away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what it makes them all look
really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be way off base and I could be
wrong, but I would put a lot of money on
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm absolutely 100% right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And God, wouldn't that be egg on their
face if they regulated their own industry
[SPEAKER_00]: out of existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought of it that way,
but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have so many, they they've created so
many different sub businesses like the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators and you know, the retail,
shop inspectors and they have,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've created this huge industry
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as farmers are going away,
they still have this many people,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're not generating that money,
all of a sudden now California is running
[SPEAKER_02]: at a deficit and the cannabis industry
that they created now is costing them a
[SPEAKER_02]: fortune.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like at one point or another,
they might not even be able to have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: people to actually run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in a, they're in a pickle right
now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looped back to the point you made
just a question or two ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: About how you were saying, you know,
many of your friends are finding it really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to remain in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the comment you made that's
really lasted with me is, um, how you said
[SPEAKER_00]: that you keep the price firm of the,
the white thorn rose for 135 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to hear someone, and just to
clarify, I'm talking about 135 for a wet
[SPEAKER_02]: pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really a five to one conversion,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it ends up being like maybe seven
or $800.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dried trim pounds go for about 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so to put that in perspective,
I guess the, the reason why I bring that
[SPEAKER_00]: up is it does beg the question,
you know, how, how do people stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses when the prices are so low and
the price you just reflected is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality where there's a bit of
premium surcharge, you know, you also
[SPEAKER_00]: referenced a $50 wet pound, you know,
is it like, is it, is it even financially
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to stay in business if that's the
prices you're able to fetch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, only if you're avoiding paying their
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're diverting, it's not,
yeah, that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not sustainable unless you maybe
flirt around with the gray areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it, I'll put it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, what do you think is the
future of sort of the mom and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, is the entire model under threat?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the entire model is definitely
under threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're pivoting and really building
your small business model with the only
[SPEAKER_02]: pathway forward I see, and I don't know
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a great business person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a farmer, but, um, really found a
lot of momentum with the white thorn rose
[SPEAKER_02]: and really think that most small farmers
should highlight those legacy strains that
[SPEAKER_02]: strains no one else in the world has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I always say that, and it
sounds redundant, but just the sound of it
[SPEAKER_02]: creates a, a little mini demand for,
for whether or not it's great or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, they just think that we
can't compete with the commercialized
[SPEAKER_02]: strains or we'll never make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, if you know, you're not going to
make it, you know, you want to pivot
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier than later in trying to make
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it's not going to work,
then you can become a fisherman or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's sad because there's a lot of,
you know, incredibly talented cultivators
[SPEAKER_00]: who probably will end up taking up a,
an alternative profession and just all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that knowledge and wisdom will sadly be
lost for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess with that in mind, what do you
think would be the most important sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: message you could give to someone who's
just trying to get into the market or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe is in the market, but struggling a
bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should they focus on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what do you think people could do a bit
better that would help their brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, what we did, and I think maybe
not even purposely, but what benefited us
[SPEAKER_02]: the most was, you know, our farm is small
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's those in-between farms that,
um, your farm's too big to work yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: or work with your family member that you
need to have employees, which then
[SPEAKER_02]: requires you to have workman's comp and
all these other expenditures that really
[SPEAKER_02]: eats at the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, uh, it's really up to me
and Rose, my girlfriend, we do all the
[SPEAKER_02]: work, you know, I'm out here at five o
'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm planting flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know, work cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, it's a little bit harder
on having any kind of freedom,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, I think you have to limit the
amount of your expenses, um, your overhead
[SPEAKER_02]: really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I don't have, uh,
I don't have high tech automated depth
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have, you know, all these high
tech expensive things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of limited my overhead in,
and it's really allowed me to produce a
[SPEAKER_02]: pound that maybe I sell for $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it costs me $250, $300 to produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know moon made farms was telling me
it costs her six to $700 a pound that she
[SPEAKER_02]: can only sell for 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that doesn't make any sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But she had to have, she had a big enough,
she had like a half an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she needed employees and they were
doing depths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do one crop a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have 65 outdoor plants and then I
have two greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, I don't have too many
plants in they get, so it's, it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: manageable for me and my overhead isn't
that big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, uh, if, yeah, it's just really up
to me and Rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, keeping your overhead low is I
think key and not trying to expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be too big now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of those bigger companies are making
it, you know, they're all failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you can't more isn't more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just focus on educating people
about who you are and your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, that's where the real value is,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's some, some great words there.
[SPEAKER_00]: More is not always more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about brings us to
our tail end of it, where we do our five
[SPEAKER_00]: quick fire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love to ask all guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question I'll ask is what's
the single most memorable experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be like the most potent
dab hit you've ever done, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe you're at a concert,
the music was just hit and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the most memorable experience
for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most memorable experience or the most
impactful experience I think I ever had
[SPEAKER_02]: was, um, several years ago, I got an email
from the warden and from the guard of the
[SPEAKER_02]: prison that I was, um, housed at for over
six years and they reached out to me and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, they felt so bad that somebody that
was growing a plant would get that much
[SPEAKER_02]: time and they learned who I was and they,
they knew I would never hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they asked to come to my farm and they
came up to my farm, spent two days here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of those two days,
um, of showing them around, of watching
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you know, federal prison guards and
wardens in playing with the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They each took six of my plants,
my, my unique cultivars home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today to this day, they still grow
those cultivars at their, their house in
[SPEAKER_02]: Lompoc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they already called me this year
and just even last week I just sent them
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds of the paradise pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, to realize that all of us,
no matter who we are, can make a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in somebody's life,
whether or not it's a prison guard and a
[SPEAKER_02]: pot grower, um, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that's really, uh,
really an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just always on my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he calls to check in on me to make
sure I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just, it just seemed so far
fetched and not even real that it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just impressed me that they could come
full circle like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the core, a message of love,
which is absolutely beautiful on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a strain where everyone around you
was hyping it up, telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, you got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you finally try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh, is that all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gush mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the first one to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, you know, it lasted a year or
two around here and that was over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they just rotate through strains that
are hype strains and, um, Gush mint was
[SPEAKER_02]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was not impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next question is I'm going to drop you off
on a desert Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the resources to grow plants
for the rest of your life, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: only take three genetics with you can be
either three clones or three packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you prefer seeds, maybe do a bit of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three things are you going to take
with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take paradise pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take white thorn resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take mom's weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no hesitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we might already have the answer to
this one, but I want to ask you anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is one of our new ones we've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say under crazy, unpredictable
circumstances, your, your house burns
[SPEAKER_00]: down, but as you're going through the
rubble, you see one pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved perfectly in the dust to restart
the company with what pack would you hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you want to restart the company
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could only pick one pack,
I would have to say paradise punch my
[SPEAKER_02]: original strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go with my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a time machine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back anywhere, any place to
presumably collect a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I do anything different to
maybe I go back in time and maybe save
[SPEAKER_02]: some of those original 21 seeds that I was
talking about the trail found in his wall
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and maybe try to breed with those and
preserve those because I believe there's
[SPEAKER_02]: some magic in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that is something that I'm
yearning to, to, to restart or refigure
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm going back in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting some of those 21 seeds and I'm
keeping them alive and I'm keeping them
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to imagine as a killer strain,
we'll all have to wait for the artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: embryos to see what's inside those last
few you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it for things today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to tell the consumer,
you know, really ironically, coming full
[SPEAKER_02]: circle from, you know, the war on drugs to
now it's, it's, it's really in the hands
[SPEAKER_02]: of the consumers, whether or not the small
farmer makes it or not, and not to put any
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure on anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you walk into your real sales,
your retail store, please ask for small
[SPEAKER_02]: sun grown cannabis and know that you're
supporting a family farm like mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of those families have kids and many
of those people care about you more than
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll ever know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that message.
