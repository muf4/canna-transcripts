we're back for another episode and on
[SPEAKER_03]: today a massive welcome to one of the
absolute Titans in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the last remaining Godfathers of
modern genetics breeder behind countless
[SPEAKER_03]: strains and organizations a big big
welcome to Shanti Baba of mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a pretty epic introduction
Not sure if I'm worthy of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to be here I had to put some respect
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was there was no doubt on that My
first question is what are you been
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix it up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I make a lot of hashes myself and I
kind of we've always made ice and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: made dry sieve and blended them together
It's kind of the old old school part of me
[SPEAKER_00]: When I tell people I used to grow all this
biomass just to make a few grams of hash
[SPEAKER_00]: They laugh, but actually it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I laughed in the end Yeah, but actually
mainly mainly hashes but specific from
[SPEAKER_00]: like super silva or mango So we we grow a
bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a little drive zip and then we try it
out like that and it's always enjoyable,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, you know Beautiful look I think
concentrates are definitely a growing part
[SPEAKER_03]: of the market and our listeners would love
to hear What are your varieties?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel work particularly well for
making concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean there's definitely varieties
First of all, if you're gonna make a
[SPEAKER_00]: sieved hash like a dry sieve like Morocco
or something like that I do go for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because outdoor plants make much
better they've got better resin glands for
[SPEAKER_00]: When when you excite them and you make the
hash usually doesn't get milky when you
[SPEAKER_00]: break it up like indoor Resin and it's
kind of It becomes like a solid hash and I
[SPEAKER_00]: must say add that about 80% of the market
used to be hashish in Europe before the
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Revolution sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and that's just since the 90s late 80s
early 90s when Norton Green started to
[SPEAKER_00]: change that ratio around but I am in
different days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love certain varieties of marijuana
around But but nautil is a great strain to
[SPEAKER_00]: make hash from the shit or the skunk one
mango haze Outstanding if you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: going for these flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's pretty hard to pass up and
of course if you're going the level haze
[SPEAKER_00]: is and it's like the champagnes of hashes
for me, so, you know But because I had so
[SPEAKER_00]: much years of experience I kind of I'm
lucky enough to be able to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and create those things and not
share them Sorry, but they make so much of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know, not commercial products
all the time Yeah, look you you nodded on
[SPEAKER_03]: the head I'm sure you've tried some things
I can only dream of and so I wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: ask, you know, especially given that you
had you know, The tight friendship with
[SPEAKER_03]: the original mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice himself Howard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the most memorable hash you've ever
had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I Remember a distinct story I was
getting busted by the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were searching my house around 2003
and there was a piece of hash that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: made and won the cannabis cup with in I
think it was 90 number 1997 98 with chunky
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs It was a hash that I really did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no no movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a dry sieve while we were
cleaning this particular line of Scunks
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'd got from Rob Clark and and I did
it must have been about 50 or 60 kilos
[SPEAKER_00]: over the silks greens and we made maybe
800 grams in total and I I sold that to
[SPEAKER_00]: Arianne and He entered it as Chunky Bubba
hash in 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we won the cup with that but I
kept A small piece and and whenever Howard
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got together We would smoke this one
because it was outstanding even Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: loved it I mean Neville and I pressed it
on the floor upstairs above the the coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shop years ago in 98 and he said wow,
this is like that was amazing pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: so When I was getting I had some
unfortunate problem in at one stage in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2003 and the police were searching the
house and they The policeman picked up
[SPEAKER_00]: this small remaining piece of hash the
Chunky Bubba hash that I had and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: about 2003 so for four or five years after
we'd won the cup with and I only kept that
[SPEAKER_00]: for Neville and I looked at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Please you can do whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just That one's something special if you
can leave it there, which I'd appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: it And I don't know it was just one of
those amazing moment still makes my hair
[SPEAKER_00]: stand up But the policeman put it down
there was about six Got a vignette going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the house searching and this guy
I'll never forget him He put it back and I
[SPEAKER_00]: left it there and when I got out from all
the issue I had that hash it was the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing left and I hang up Howard and I told
him fly over mate we have some work to do
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically that was a really Yeah,
I was very sad when that finished but
[SPEAKER_00]: every good thing comes to an end
unfortunately Wow that that is an
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely brilliant story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that You knew what had to be done
out of curiosity was that um, was that in
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia or in like Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in Switzerland in Switzerland in
2003 But but the hash I'd made in 97 98
[SPEAKER_00]: with Neville And I've been collecting it
for probably a year So, I mean you really
[SPEAKER_00]: make very small amounts if you do very
like 1% of whatever you're doing Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people overdo the spins and they
start getting a brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like where it's gray and white and
tasty and Then we then we normally once we
[SPEAKER_00]: finish the dry stuff We put it in the
water and we make the ice and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: blend them together in ratios to find a
good hash So it's a because what ice is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost clinical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So and the dry is flavorsome and aromatic
So when you put them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've still got the same resins,
but they're slightly Different ones
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner than the other and the others got
turbines and one doesn't so you blend them
[SPEAKER_00]: together You make a fantastic,
you know piece of hash I Suggest that to
[SPEAKER_00]: your viewers Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, look the the art of blending is so
relatively unexplored in the industry I
[SPEAKER_03]: think and you just probably outlaid more
knowledge on it than what I've ever really
[SPEAKER_03]: heard I guess I'll just follow that up Do
you do you like just trial and error with
[SPEAKER_03]: the blending or is it like you're trying
to blend terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and it all began when we were in
Say the early 90s when I first came down
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to try to kind of Replicate a
breed by having a pure haze and a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica and sort of 75 25 or 50 50 or and
try to see how they They came up so skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: or northern light pure or the hazes you
could put 25 25 50 percent together and
[SPEAKER_00]: you spike that joint and you kind of have
an idea of what a breed May generally be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know sort of be showing Manifesting
and and that would be a way so the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: for me was an extension of that because
it's like wine making nowadays,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really I'm right into red wine,
especially from you know, I know quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about Italian wines and and so I and
and Spanish wines and I I really think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the blending of pure strains in
different proportions you can really make
[SPEAKER_00]: new new world wines and That's a good
winemaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like everyone can have the same
tools, but they don't do the same job You
[SPEAKER_00]: know certain people have a understanding
that goes way and beyond other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding when they're looking at the
same thing, so I've never really been
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about people copying I mean they
try their best but and they do some people
[SPEAKER_00]: do better jobs than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing plants for sure,
but you know when it comes to breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's We worked it out now to do
that over the last 40 50 years have been
[SPEAKER_00]: done for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, oh Wow, we're gonna have to
talk about some Italian wines another day
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm passionate like yourself, but you've
just got me curious Have you ever had any
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that were born from that sort of
you know remixed processes you mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: like where you mix them and you were like,
you know What let's do it and then it went
[SPEAKER_00]: on to make something legendary Yeah,
most of the early stuff in the early 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: when I used to sit around with Neville and
in each place down in the south of Holland
[SPEAKER_00]: and we would we would blend up different
few things that we were working on and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to and a lot of I mean, it sounds a bit of
a goofy way to do things, but actually
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's quite a good resource when when
you're trying to Imagine a sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean to To imagine a smell
and a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine a picture or something but
flavors and that it's very difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: concept and so when you put a kind of a
practical thing there and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly taste something that was in those
proportions and you know, maybe Slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different hazes and slightly different
skunks gave a different thing so you could
[SPEAKER_00]: tweak them a little bit We were lucky
enough to be growing so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and different versions of the same
seeds we could play with sisters and A lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of a lot of love and time went into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very creative process which most
people might not Kind of understand but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's it's like a fourth dimension
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to visualize different
parallel things that are very hard with
[SPEAKER_00]: your finger on and words to most of the
time so You know we come to it ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone has a feeling as well So that
that hopefully if you've got a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: intuition about things or you use them a
lot and you know what you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: Which neville and I did um, we both sort
of came together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We self-policed ourselves We didn't
bullshit, you know if it didn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't work in you know, but when it
worked a little bit you thought And you
[SPEAKER_00]: followed that down the line a little bit
And create a few strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you're underselling it with a
few but uh that that's really legendary to
[SPEAKER_03]: hear i'm So stoked to hear that because
i've heard some people talk about blending
[SPEAKER_03]: flour, but I think you're you're right How
should be the next level up?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question that comes to mind is is
is this largely speaking how you approach
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding these days or is it more of like
a Paper, you know, you write things down
[SPEAKER_00]: and just see what works I have my canon
bible and I write notes about everything
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of seed Sort of packages I
have in the fridge are from different Um
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stages of the breeding so I can go
back to The second stage and continue it
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the fifth stage if i've got time or
so i've got a lot of projects like First
[SPEAKER_00]: second third fourth fifth stage in the
fridge all the time uh, the thing is that
[SPEAKER_00]: um You know, I don't think there's a lot
of breeding going on so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, uh, maybe this tissue
culture is going to save it and maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: know sort of laboratory kind of um
Catalyzed breeding will will happen with
[SPEAKER_00]: with dna and reconstitutions and stuff,
but oh You know selective natural
[SPEAKER_00]: selection breeding, which is something
that I still think is um It has much more
[SPEAKER_00]: merit because it's both theory and
practical in a in an area um You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh without chemicals and spraying male
females to make them male and do all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that Which is that this new sort of fast
food culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: um For me, it used to take two years to
make a breed or longer four or five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and and people Want something
new every week nowadays?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean they're just spraying,
uh gelato to girl scout cookie to wedding
[SPEAKER_00]: cake and I don't even know what these
parents are anymore So I don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they when they talk about these names
I have no idea what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a push?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it skunk push?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually those two but I mean very very
little is anything else, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: every so often you might hit something
that's got a little bit of sativa in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Or or a bit of hate but I don't think
anyone really knows the origins of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking about nowadays because You
know, they don't have to select males very
[SPEAKER_03]: often You know any regular seed companies
do Yeah, I mean is it safe to say that we
[SPEAKER_03]: probably won't see any fems being offered
by you in the future for that reason I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never I've never um, and I've said it
right from the beginning Of that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice is I keep it a kind of regular
seed company Even though we make feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed for other companies and we've made it
for CBD crew our other projects We don't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe we don't want people To breed with
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would prefer them to search out real
males and real females through males and
[SPEAKER_00]: true females And and use feminized seed or
auto flowering seed for flowering You know
[SPEAKER_00]: and making that sort of thing they all
they all have a kind of application as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as I'm concerned I don't have anything
against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that We're probably more purist
at heart and we would like to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: that and and there's a lot more people
buying our seed nowadays for the males So,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I don't think there's a lot of people
that can Find the origins or know where
[SPEAKER_00]: they picked up that variety from and what
I joined to in in what year in Holland,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I've been doing it a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suppose that become that knowledge
becomes wisdom after a period of decades,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean Hugely hugely look you
you mentioned the CBD crew and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: something I definitely wanted to touch on
because the very first CBD I ever smoked I
[SPEAKER_03]: got from CBD shark shock from uh from some
of your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a brilliant plant What stimulated
you to get into the CBD work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as far as I can tell you were one
of the first yeah, we were The first we
[SPEAKER_00]: were the first by a long way I came out of
jail in Switzerland and I sort of taken
[SPEAKER_00]: the responsibility of the whole company on
my shoulders for that issue and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: You know THC had been it was was allowed
for the about four or five years in
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland we were making a lot of it and
then all of a sudden we had the period
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was not allowed anymore and it
kind of I didn't wasn't going to change my
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to come out with a new kind of
tact and While I was in we we realized I
[SPEAKER_00]: was always reading and stuff and then when
I came out I was talking to some very good
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and we We were talking about all
the other cannabinoids, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's time now because we've been
working with laboratories a little bit We
[SPEAKER_00]: were one of the we were the first to work
with canna it foundation in spain and they
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored CBD crew to do all the testing
so we could actually make a scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company where we could prove every
step of the way rather than mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice or the greenhouse that was just
feeling that was what I liked and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully other people liked it and and
that you know, so one was my opinion and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other one the science in the way and
and so CBD crew came out of self
[SPEAKER_00]: rehabilitation maybe it was something like
that thinking how can I Continue on
[SPEAKER_00]: working on the plant but be legal because
I had enough of being persecuted for
[SPEAKER_00]: working on a plant that doesn't know that
it's illegal I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the most ridiculous situation you
could ever talk about but I live in that
[SPEAKER_00]: world unfortunately and it's had a lot of
harsh realities and you know, and so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: family gone through a lot of stuff,
but I'm still here doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously You know part of the life and
So you have to come to terms with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to work out the best way and at that
stage 2006 7 we started delving in and by
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009 we found a crew and we've already
developed stuff and then We brought it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the world and then we started we offered
it actually the CBD crew was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: company that went to all the other
companies like Barney's farm and duck
[SPEAKER_00]: passion and and and paradise and There's
about 20 of them medical seeds and and we
[SPEAKER_00]: offered to CBT eyes They're they're two
main plants, which they all sent me to two
[SPEAKER_00]: of their mothers we did the work over
about a Year and then we gave them a
[SPEAKER_00]: sample that had to approve it and then
they'd have to buy the seed off us For the
[SPEAKER_00]: first year until they worked out how to do
it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we it was kind of the very first seed
union I've been pushing for for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years, but I had to Do it by sort of brute
force and having something that they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have that stuff and they all wanted
and you see what happened with CBD Strange
[SPEAKER_00]: they went ballistic for a while and now of
course, you know, like I said,
it was agricultural and now it's come back
to being agricultural and not Another
another form of recreational where
everyone thought the same money would be
[SPEAKER_00]: there for the CBD flowers But it's not
it's a it's a medical product,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Yeah, wow, what an incredible
story and I think we all owe you you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you for the perseverance on that one
I guess I'd love to ask a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_03]: out there had to work from like hemp and
various sort of Stock to get that CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that how you sort of developed that
initial project?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did you find a special plant that
happened to exhibit it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all what we we came The
difference between what the thinking was
[SPEAKER_00]: this that hemp Had been on the market for
many years and under point three percent
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and it didn't have any value when it
came to turpent profile And I always
[SPEAKER_00]: thought turpent profile always thought
turpent profile has something very very
[SPEAKER_00]: strong to do with the whole effect Okay,
this is before everyone Hypothesized about
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect and that but I always
thought that when you you found something
[SPEAKER_00]: that was exceptionally You know like a
firm own something that you really liked
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were attracted to and the flavor
and the taste did something to you then
[SPEAKER_00]: you obviously Had something as well as the
the CBD and the THC and whatever else was
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So My idea was to come from recreational
and bring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bring bring instead of bringing the THC
down up from a hemp variety we decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the THC down and the CBD up and
Funnily enough we haven't found a pure CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it was it was selected by a guy in
Spain and we tested it all and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the parent of remedy we called it and That
was the parent to most everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: began this enrichment in CBD And the
reason why we did it one-to-one was first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all when you take a pure THC and you
take a pure CBD the the next generation is
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50 basically and for me that was the
medicine when you increase the CBD to a
[SPEAKER_00]: level of you know higher than the one or
the point three percent, but you brought
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to sort of 15 16 and also the THC to
8 or 9 or 10 There was a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different effect and that was the medical
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the beginning of the medical
Concepts and since then I've started up my
[SPEAKER_00]: own pharmaceutical company in Czech
Republic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, we make a lot of pills and and
and oils and we supply a lot of Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: companies with the base products and they
do all their packaging over here under our
[SPEAKER_00]: label So we we branched out into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I probably left breeding a
little bit and went into Trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: influence other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stubborn pigheaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose but you know You got to learn as
I said, we've all been benefited from it
[SPEAKER_03]: and as you said in the last answer You
know that CBD sort of had its rise to fame
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's fallen down a little bit But I'd
love to hear what do you think is the
[SPEAKER_03]: future of CBD and out of your offerings?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a general CBD strain you could
recommend to people if they're keen to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a go Well, I think CBD has a very
big future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that the hype behind it all
like The hype behind the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: companies going on the stock market the
hype behind all of that is just the first
[SPEAKER_00]: wave of Silliness, you know people with
too much money that want to invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: something think they're gonna become
millionaires tomorrow they all run to one
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the ship the ship goes down and
Then slowly you get rid of those people
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get the second wave where the ship
is back standing again And now you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of understand how these concepts fit
in CBD is a plant that should be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors first of all It doesn't need to
have indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower is never enough for a person
really To gain the full CBD effect you
[SPEAKER_00]: need over 20% And so we make pills with 6%
CBD you take two or three, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start micro and you go up and there's
big benefits of CBD there's no doubt about
[SPEAKER_00]: that in my mind and I use it maybe twice
or three times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids have been using it since I've made
it I've got about five or six pills like
[SPEAKER_00]: we sell it now in blister packs where we
look like proper company and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the 0.3% for the European
market and no THC for many of the products
[SPEAKER_00]: but the CBD and the turpent so the turpent
The turpent was a very big thing for us
[SPEAKER_00]: and it proved to be correct because
basically when we did select a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: strain It was yummy to CBD yummy to I only
work with that strain It makes all my the
[SPEAKER_00]: base products It makes all the
distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I clone it I put it outside and we grow
fields of that and then we do that for the
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction So we are very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing from seed to For that we
were growing from clone that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: selected and being tested and so I really
know what we're making Whereas farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow the seed varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do extraction and make it into
isolate pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a what single Compound so they don't
have to think about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need To get the percentages up
of CBD to make it more valuable or less
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable So there's many ways to to go
about this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me CBD is agricultural You know,
that's what many people should understand
[SPEAKER_00]: and it always has been in my head and it
always will be because You need to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: large amount of biomass to extract it to
make the price still Normal right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price was about 80,000 euros a kilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we first started If no one
extracted it now you can buy for $250 a
[SPEAKER_00]: kilo You know, this is one of the biggest
drops In the world where everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: going up that's come down, you know what I
mean big time and so You have to be a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp farmer to make it
profitable And and a lot of the small guys
[SPEAKER_00]: we thought they were gonna make millions
have all disappeared over the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years, so There's still production of
course and we still Condone and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: still doing it ourselves, but there's a
production for what you can sell and what
[SPEAKER_00]: your market is not just for the world and
So I don't suggest people will get into
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that they don't have a market for
because I mean then you're just holding it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it costs money to make it so You know,
you can lose a lot of things Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know from experience There you go sage
advice there so take me back to the start
[SPEAKER_03]: what was your first experience with
cannabis Jeepers that was We in Melbourne
[SPEAKER_00]: with a group of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I remember the one time I first
got stoned because we smoked a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was around 1415 and it didn't really
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd finished school done my HSC
started at Melbourne Uni and Went over to
[SPEAKER_00]: a mate's place on the weekend and he had
There was a row of houses on one side and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a strip of grass on another side and
we used to smoke bombs and Some guy down
[SPEAKER_00]: the road had given us his homegrown
whatever and we put it in the bomb and
[SPEAKER_00]: first time ever, you know, and I remember
My me and my mate thought we saw this
[SPEAKER_00]: white line down this green strip and it
went up a hill and so we were on our knees
[SPEAKER_00]: following each other And and then I
realized when what are we doing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and the real and we start
laughing our heads off and realize we must
[SPEAKER_00]: be really stoned This is the effect and we
loved the six-pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like Yes, so it was a really good
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, but so with most things in
life, you know that you laugh at And yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was one of the first ones I remember
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I hope other people can relate At
that time were there did varieties have
[SPEAKER_03]: names or was it still in that era of like
just good versus less good?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called grass, you know and you would
just get whatever the dealer or your mate
[SPEAKER_00]: had or whoever grew it or some friend of a
friend who You know and ripped off
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's brand a branch off that was
overhanging their fence or something I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean in those days in there in the 80s I
was landscaped gardening in Melbourne and
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I knew where all marijuana was
because we were always down the back lanes
[SPEAKER_00]: and bringing in dirt and soil and and turf
and stuff and you know, you always saw
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're standing on a trailer,
you can see who's growing one or two dope
[SPEAKER_00]: plants here and there it didn't seem such
a Big thing, but there was always you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, if cops found it you'd have a big
big adventure unfortunately But I never
[SPEAKER_00]: saw it as a criminal activity and I still
don't and even though I've unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: had some time to ponder things in Swiss
hotels and Italian hotels, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them the jails I kind of never
really It never diluted down my my feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: about it because the plant the plant
doesn't know all this bullshit that humans
[SPEAKER_03]: put you know And out of curiosity,
what was the progression from sort of that
[SPEAKER_03]: point to you growing for the first time
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean it was an outstanding
experience and I thought well if I find
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds then better get into this
because I was always into at one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: first jobs I was always the kind of the
bit of the leader to find work and then
[SPEAKER_00]: employ my friends, you know, and we would
always be painting houses or weeding
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, you know, and then weeding
gardens started to take over and became
[SPEAKER_00]: like fixing up gardens and I slowly went
into landscaped gardening while I was at
[SPEAKER_00]: uni as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were parallel things and I just
loved I loved different varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and I like growing things and in
getting harvests of fruit and from passion
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit to bananas to avocados to I mean,
I love all that stuff still to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in an apartment in Switzerland and
I still have tomatoes growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumbers and all the herbs and everything
I've become very Italianized but but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I live on the border of Italy and
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of, you know, go there a lot and
very influenced in their food and culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Italians are really excellent at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, they're the first ones to ban
all this artificial growing meat and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: officially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like them for that,
you know, they think that you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 different chemicals in something rather
just one and they grow it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like their attitude like that,
the Italians and the Europeans pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not like the Americans
or the Australians or Canadians where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the food seems to be a lot more
in the culture kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hugely, hugely that, you know,
sort of looping back to when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking about Italian wines when I
started to sort of learn a bit more about
[SPEAKER_03]: them and how many indigenous varieties of
grapes they have and how they grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It echoes the sentiment you just said
perfectly, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they know what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I just wanted to say that
there's this kind of invisible line going
[SPEAKER_00]: through Europe and it touches Spain,
South of France, Italy, Croatia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's the kind of the olive oil line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then above that is the butter kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the north of Europe is very much
dairy and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I've been vegetarian,
I eat fish sometimes, but I'm mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-based food for the last 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always been on the olive oil side
because it's very different kind of taste
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mediterranean cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the wealth of knowledge that the
farmers from these areas had, I go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Barolo's two hours from my home,
you know, and it's probably one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest places in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nebbiolo is probably my favorite grape
of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tempranillo and Nebbiolo, you know,
they're up there in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, at the time truffles,
porcini mushrooms, and they're harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: the dolcetto and the Barbera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're probably this week they're
doing the Nebbiolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same time as the harvest for
our outdoor marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny that, you know, I kind of keep
an eye on it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I live in an area where there's all
Merlot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this part of Switzerland,
it's all Merlot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of Merlot, but I mean,
I live amongst the vineyards here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just interesting to kind of draw
parallels from agriculture, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the experience that our grandparents
had, they used to always grow vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even, you know, Australia was,
you couldn't go to every shop to buy all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you had to sort of do it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my grandfather on my father's side and
my mum's side, they were both avid
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suppose I got the bug from that kind
of beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Intergenerational.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of good points there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that you're a Nebbiolo fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're kindred spirits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you get over here, I've got quite
a big collection, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Australian scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I've only got one bottle of
Barolo because they like to mark it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can visit that another time.
[SPEAKER_03]: To loop back to the last question,
how did you progress from sort of when you
[SPEAKER_03]: were first getting into it to doing that
initial work in Malumbimbi?
[SPEAKER_03]: And was that where you would say you first
sort of got deep into the scene,
[SPEAKER_03]: or would you say it was before that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bit before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, there was early days in the
Melbourne Indian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my girlfriend, she'd grown up in
Melbourne and then moved up to Main Arm in
[SPEAKER_00]: near Malumbimbi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a company called Main Arm
Landscaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named it after that, but it was in
Melbourne.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to go sort of do uni,
work a little bit in the landscaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would go up to Malumb,
kind of once a month or that during the
[SPEAKER_00]: uni time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we were growing dope outside,
you kind of had to check on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was all very illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bringing it down on the train,
you know, sort of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a kilo or whatever, a pillow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all sewn into a pillow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, plastic wrapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't have the vacuum seals in
those days, but we made it as good as we
[SPEAKER_00]: could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would sell it in a matter of hours
in Melbourne, you know, to all my uni
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just basically supplying the uni
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was so special, that marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really reminds me, I think it's very,
very much the same as Neville Hayes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was an outdoor growing,
Thai-Columbian mixtures, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were definitely involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were a very long leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they became huge plants,
but you could bend them over and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: train them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to Operation Noah,
used to always be going on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain times of the year up there,
the helicopters were flying, the motorbike
[SPEAKER_00]: cops were going in to try to bust through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we survived all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one got really maybe lost a few
plants here and there to a few people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but had to worry about brown snakes and
shit like that more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that was more terrorizing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of cut our teeth on a different
way, I suppose, in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was kind of good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's legendary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, in terms of the Mullum
madness, I think the question I hear the
[SPEAKER_03]: most is, what's the genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just gave a good answer to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did those genetics come about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just something that your friends
had access to and you wanted to improve
[SPEAKER_03]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, there's a couple of schools
of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to sort of put anyone
down who was in that period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that period of time, there was no
real, it's not like now where we shared
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you were a dope grower,
kind of people knew you were a dope
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, but you didn't really talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you didn't even, you didn't want
to put yourself into problems way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't want to show that you knew
that someone else was in problems way in
[SPEAKER_00]: case they got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sometimes you became friendly
with a few and you'd swap some seeds with
[SPEAKER_00]: this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd just come back from a travel in
Thailand or somebody come back from
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia with some Panama red or someone
had come back from another spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Cambodia or Laos or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of Australians were in
that whole band archer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the 80s, the 70s and 80s,
a lot of people were traveling,
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies were traveling and collecting
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collected for wax jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collected fruit for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Australia is not legal to
bring back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used to send it and hide it in
things when we send it back in post.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of things came from,
let's just say, areas, but unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: origins, you know, and our version of
Mother Mimi Madness was very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: what we recreated with the Neville's Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as I'm concerned, was a very
long flowering plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely mind blowing when it
came to smoking it and the flavors and it
[SPEAKER_00]: had the alpine spicy menthol uplifting
effect, you know, and it was, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still is, if you pay too much,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if you balance those things,
and then you get used to them sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you have to mix it up with different
varieties to keep everything good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I suppose the origins for us
came from all those areas that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think the reason why it's so
popular is because there's so much sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: allure and mystery around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Australia, you know, every avid
grower in Mullen Bimby likes to think
[SPEAKER_03]: they've got the original Mullen Madness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd be curious to know, did you ever
really give the seeds out or was it more
[SPEAKER_03]: just something you kept for yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did give our version of seeds to several
people, growers over the years that are
[SPEAKER_00]: requested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've still got them in the fridge
upstairs in the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of strains that I've
collected in, you know, they're all loaded
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've been, you know, I've got stuff
from the late 80s still in the fridges
[SPEAKER_00]: from Neville's stock and my stock and,
you know, it still germinates,
[SPEAKER_00]: but much less, of course, if you keep it
vacuum sealed in fridges and not taking in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out all the time, you can keep seeds
for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the germination levels go down and
we've managed to get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, we've got a couple of Old
Northern Lights too and some Ortega,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bio Ortega and Pure Hayes, variety Pure
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've puffed it out a few old seeds to see
if we can get them something going from
[SPEAKER_00]: them as well because we've got a bit of
room in our research area now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to revive a couple of
really old hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a four-way indicator kind of thing,
the original hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I've seen all over the net,
they don't look anything like the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that I remember working on with
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you kind of, I'm a bit inspired to
correct, not correct, just to put out an
[SPEAKER_00]: original version to show you what we
thought was hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, names mean shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mean nothing actually because no one
is giving origins of where plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very, very, very difficult
thing for someone who's got an inquisitive
[SPEAKER_00]: mind to try to understand where does that
strain originate from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Afghani original?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Mexican?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all hybrid by hybrids,
by chemical hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of losing its, that's what I
meant by the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of been watered down and it
became too quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something good in life,
you've got to spend a bit of time on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that you test everything
properly to make sure that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not a lot of that is going on anymore,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing happens when you buy the seed and
you're the tester and the retailer and the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you become, you know, and I know so
much about all the other seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, the exaggerations that
have put on, and for some reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people in the world believe that
seed companies that have been in Holland
[SPEAKER_00]: for many years are all legal and they've
been doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all not legal, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, seeds are made with growing higher
THC than 0.3 and that's still not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tolerated if you're not caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, to this day,
that's the actual stance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow a little bit going on in
Holland and in certain countries now
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not really as dangerous as
they probably thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they probably prefer to get the
electricity paid rather than stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, these things are now slowly
coming to the surface, 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most things, I mean, like these are
companies that say they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: established since 1985 or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no seed companies in those
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were companies that happened in the
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Neville was one of the first ones,
I think, in the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, 87, 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's a lot of
fabrication to companies trying to merge
[SPEAKER_00]: into things, but they've got no history
behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you check, you realize that they're
all exaggerating things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really live in that world anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to live in our world and we just
do whatever sort of job that we think is
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, a number of really awesome
talking points you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to just quickly loop back,
you know, because you mentioned the hash
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that you're familiar with is not
really the one you see these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cutting these days that gets discussed
as the one that we think you may have been
[SPEAKER_03]: working with is people call it the PNW
hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know much about this and how would
you describe the one that you worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the PNW hash plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm on my own forum and I'm on my
Instagram, but I don't really do too much
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the third podcast in my
life, so you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of maybe a bit ignorant about
what everyone talks about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people weren't even born when
I had versions out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult for them to know
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult for them to really
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only believing stories that have
been passed down to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to say that anyone's
got the wrong version or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that like the White Widow,
for example, when you first made it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we made White Widow and it was
particularly this mother with this father.
[SPEAKER_00]: People bought the S1 seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next year, every company had
White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't the original version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people think because it's called
White Widow, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the selection of the person
who's doing the breeding then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what we talked about with the
wine making.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put all the same tools together,
people select different ratios and
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the individuality of the
person blending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, our original hash plant,
what it looks like is very strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: very sturdy stem, first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to stick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to hold it for weight or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it grows very upright stems where
the flowers are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bit reddish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reddish, purple, maroon aura to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got four different types of indicus
involved in the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like gravity, that was the original
one part before it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a plant that we made with a series
of indicus as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one distinct thing about the hash
plant was when it was flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: it made very yellow hairs, exceptionally
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something you'd see with this
reddish aura kind of leaf and very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: stem and then a very yellow kind of hairs
on the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the version what we'd been
working on for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd selected and gone down the
inbreeding road for maybe three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I must say to everybody, I mean,
once you buy seeds from different
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and you do three or four
generations, there's nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: what it originally was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much to do with your
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it becomes the origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to know where they come from,
but it becomes yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have a claim to rename it in a
way, you know, but not when you squirt
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato and then, you know, you do it with
your scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you just really do it with
hybridizing hybrids, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's mainly for flavors most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suppose, you know, the American
market dictates a lot of things to create
[SPEAKER_00]: a frenzy around things, but a lot of it's
to do with push and skunk getting stoned
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavorsome, you know, and then like,
you know, that might be really good sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of for the majority of people in the
States, but over in Europe, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people don't want to get too stoned,
but they like to have an uplifting effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they smoke a lot more sativa,
you know, or the old school Californians
[SPEAKER_00]: or Hawaiians, they were smoking a lot more
sativary kind of influence plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, they're all damn good on a good
day, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that said to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just touched on a topic,
which is really prevalent, which is it
[SPEAKER_03]: feels like sativa are becoming less and
less common or maybe less demanded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like we're going to reach a
point where sativas are almost impossible
[SPEAKER_03]: to find, or do you think there'll always
be a little group of diehards?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they'll, you know, I mean,
most of our, our, our sales, if I go on,
[SPEAKER_00]: has pretty much gone back to hazes,
anything with the haze in the name,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're selling much more this year than
ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what happens is, you know,
there's cycles for fashion, there's cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: for haircuts, there's cycles for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, long hair comes back into
fashion, if you stay there long enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I'm not saying anything
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I kind of just know that when
you stick to something good, and you
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to make it in a good way,
there'll always be a market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people really don't like the
psychotic, that kind of almost want to
[SPEAKER_00]: vomit, throw up effect from hazes,
because some of them are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, from zero to 100, you know,
and you kind of, you know, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a bit off-putting for people who
are very sensitive to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then now there's nebbiolo or,
or, or, you know, teppanillo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some people like white
wine, some people prefer Franciacorta or
[SPEAKER_00]: champagne or carvo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you know, it's it's a,
I look at it as an individual medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you find a strain that really does
something to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The masterquish scab, for example,
the masterquish used to always make me
[SPEAKER_00]: very creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start writing, I would draw,
I would design things, I would,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and every time I used it,
it was always the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt, well, that was, that's a
really interesting, you know, you start to
[SPEAKER_00]: use it for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I had to do something,
I would go for the masterquish.
[SPEAKER_00]: As distinct from say early queen would be
a completely different effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another flavor completely different off
the charts, you know, and so there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think there'll be always a
market for hazers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people are slowly getting a
little bit, you know, sort of dizzy from
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the things that are going around at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and let's face it, I mean,
it's very hard to replicate these things
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't feminize them, because
there's, there's not many people really
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping, you know, sort of doing research
into, you know, 100 variety, 100 seeds of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, tsunami and 100 seeds of
gelato, and then finding males and then
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what happens to them, they're
mainly just squirting them with the macho
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And off we go, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think you really need,
I consider them producers of seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't consider them breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm just making definitions for
myself, to how I do my business with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of seed companies come to us
because they don't have the rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want something produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would always do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we agree on something,
if we had spare rooms going at one stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, we did a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do it so much anymore,
because I got burnt a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that you still try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's silly not to try if you've
got the opportunity, and you'll never know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you learn from things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never know what doors open from
when you think one door is opening,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it was something completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you're open to all of
that, you'll have no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're not open to it,
don't start this job.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've certainly heard that sentiment
before, you know, and you're right,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a big distinction between,
you know, the ways people made seed back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the day with larger numbers versus now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to quickly ask you, you mentioned,
you know, hazes on the up and up in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of popularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've certainly noticed this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think part of the allure is that
unique high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And specifically, people always talk about
how there's no ceiling on the haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you just keep going if you keep
hitting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess my question would be,
why do you think some of the older,
[SPEAKER_03]: more sort of special genetics have no
ceiling?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas a lot of the newer stuff,
the gelatos, the cookies, they don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: that, like there's like a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just get to a point and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think when you breed, when you
make a selection from, say, land races
[SPEAKER_00]: originally, you know, let's go right back
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a selection for a particular
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in Mr. Nice, I would look for the
structure of the plant, the stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few things that tell me it's
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would start to go, affect,
how does it affect me?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it look when we, what's the
yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it handle humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Various things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that we considered each
trait before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, they're pumping it out so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like banana with apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a new gelato, a new ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're making flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're starting to bring in
flavoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not naturally there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start to, and for me,
it's, it's just control when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because you've, you've only selected
for one or two traits and not five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, which used to be selected for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And affect is one of those ones that I
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked all of this new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make seeds of certain companies and
this new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look like skunks and cushions and
different versions of that sort of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: type of origin, if I generally just say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, they, none, none of them have
made me want to go back and smoke them for
[SPEAKER_00]: affect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes for couch lock, you know,
I'm not a real big fan for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes it's funny to, to kind of,
you know, sort of go to sleep in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a kind of narcotic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that the general thing is
that they're, they're lacking in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in trait selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so that's where you get a ceiling
on the, I mean, they've gone up to 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to prove that they're
so high in THC, but that's not what gets
[SPEAKER_00]: you stoned only, you know, it's
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, turpans are in
such small quantities, they must be so
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful, you know, much more powerful
than a THC or a CBD component on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the turpens, you, you, you 0.006
milligrams on a thing has that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put 0.008, it changes it
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So turpens for me have, they're used in
such small concentrations for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't find plants with more than
three, I mean, once you dry it around
[SPEAKER_00]: three, one to 3% would be a turpent
profile that most plants would have in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in concentration of turpent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not eight, nine, 10, 12, you know,
whatever they're doing nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you're, you're super,
you know, you're, you're super pimping a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant flavor because, you know,
the American market wants to taste more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas is not, you know, bigger,
it's not only better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, things that are refined,
that have a flavor that have kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: depth to it and have, you know,
it's like wine again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate, I don't mean to bring it up all
the time, but it, I base it on wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: olives, and cannabis for me are the three
most important plants in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they run together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The olives come a little bit later than
the wine, but they, I could grow them all
[SPEAKER_00]: together very comfortably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there's a lot of parallels in
those industries because when you taste
[SPEAKER_00]: certain olives, of course you've got
flavors and you've got low flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've got very intense flavors and
then you've got a different chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: components on, on the olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so when you start to look
at agricultural products and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand things like that, then you'll
see that, that that's the, then you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what you're looking at for a
change, you know, and then you start to
[SPEAKER_00]: go, oh, that's the bit I like,
you know, it's that better carafenol is
[SPEAKER_00]: the turpentine that I'm finding that spicy
kind of black peppery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, and then you start to pick
things and you see it, if you analyze all
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that you've selected,
you might see that they're quite high in
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular turpentine as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there's, there's, with the tools
that we've, we've advanced with and used
[SPEAKER_00]: right throughout the agricultural industry
and adapted to cannabis, we're definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: now exposing things that have been there,
but now we can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We maybe, you know, they weren't in
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why hashes, for example,
where you concentrate a flowering field to
[SPEAKER_00]: just a particular condensed resin gland,
oil of resin gland, you get a much better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of that plant from making a
small bit of hash and, and the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: the medium, if it's from a seed crop,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's methods to this
madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you believe that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that so much wisdom there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll all have to go back and
listen to that again and highly encourage
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone to check out Gordal Olives.
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just going to quickly ask you,
cause you mentioned it a few questions
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, you spoke about the Mr. Nice forums
and I think these have to be a staple in
[SPEAKER_03]: the community over the years in terms of a
place where people could go, share
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge, find knowledge, lots of amazing
posts on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you, how has it affected
you running this forum over the years?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, have you learned any cool
things, anything surprisingly come out of
[SPEAKER_03]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the beginning, I was doing it on
Heaven's Stairway Canadian forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of the first breeders to be
accessible all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of started in the late nineties
being moderating my own site and doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: from ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Stairway to Heaven was busted and
they, when Richard went down, we all
[SPEAKER_00]: started to open up our own sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I suppose it was kind of
ready when I left Greenhouse and moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland and then opened up Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already I'd opened up Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started to do a website and then I
realized how important it was to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be accessible to talk to individuals who
had relevant questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't get that from a shop that
was selling our seeds always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I prefer one-on-one at the end of,
if you speak to, you know, five people a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, at the end of the year, there's 1500
more people that you've influenced and you
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly, after a hundred thousand years,
you've influenced a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long I feel like I've been
doing it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the forum was very essential,
still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to be laser fair with it and allow
people to police themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got into a bit of problem when the
community got too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over sort of 50,000, then you start
getting eclipsed and you get people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are just there to disrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't have time to do that sort
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of a sudden on the websites and
social media, you get things that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: never thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily I've just got really good
growers involved who try to keep it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Mushashi, one of the main
moderator along with me on the site,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in his seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a wonderful guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very feet on the ground, balanced
guy, sort of dilutes down any in-house
[SPEAKER_00]: arguing and keeps it real and relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I expect that as a community and
grows and we get bigger as well as we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, you need to kind of, if you come
into our house, this is what the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: limits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never thought about those things
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think of limits, but
unfortunately everybody's different in
[SPEAKER_00]: this world and they don't all kind of see
eye to eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, respectful, let's just say,
I like people to be respectful to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other, whether they have completely
different backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really been racist or sexist or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they can do the job,
I'm all ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that was always important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we employed every race, every,
well, there's only two sexes as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned because I'm still breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that XX and XY, I call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't want to get involved in any
of that, but still to this day,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have other things to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to hear your perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can certainly appreciate your
sentiment about people will come up with
[SPEAKER_03]: some talking points and ideas you'd never
even considered once you've been exposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to enough of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things I definitely wanted
to ask you was, you know, over the years,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a lot of people draw references
to some of the much later posts that
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville made on the forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would use screenshots and be
like, oh, you know, this says that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, not you Shanti is in like someone
they're talking to on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be like, well, you're actually
incorrect because Neville said this here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the stuff he said did go
against the grain of what had been sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess from your point of view,
did you see anything that you weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: quite sure was real or did it all check
out from your point of view?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that was possibly a fault of my
own, because when I finally got Neville to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and go online, because he never he
avoided that for years and years when he
[SPEAKER_00]: came in, he.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just think about the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not he was not the easiest guy to get
along with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was definitely coming from he was
slightly older than me, but he come from a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard knock school.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought the community or the people
kind of owed a little bit to him for more
[SPEAKER_00]: than what he'd received or what he'd been
sort of dealt out in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunate problems he had early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just setting the scene for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of he had sometimes he had a
little bit of a chip on his shoulder for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: His information about varieties and
strains were usually always correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a time when he started to
diverge from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard and I, when he wanted invited him
into the CBD crew at that stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was still with us and he wanted to go
on with so-called seed donations he'd got
[SPEAKER_00]: from people over the years and he was
recreating higher THC stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was in Australia and he was working
with some guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it started to go a bit funny
because he started to direct traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: towards what he believed to be the next
new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and he he was quite wrong and made a
lot of promises to people and maybe didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: come good with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he slowly made a few people upset and
had to take him off the moderation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we split ways when we went into
the CBD stuff because we concentrated on
[SPEAKER_00]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really wanted I think he was living
in Western Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went he he got some contracts with some
companies that were going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis thing and then they never saw
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid a lot of money and he maybe was
going downhill then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know the last part of I wasn't
I tried to talk to him a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a bit angry with myself because of
how we had to go our own ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he never came back to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I sort of maintained all of
the plant stock and the seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been doing that since 2001 when
he left kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's difficult to understand what
he was probably sick at a certain stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't really aware of his family
were really quite aware of about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I loved him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a fountain of knowledge for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was it was great to have a peer in
that team, especially in a foreign country
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're both Australian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of just accidental.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, I mean, I always
thought I think I did an interview once
[SPEAKER_00]: with him telling me I called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they see me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said accidental here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of felt like we were accidental
heroes because we didn't know where we
[SPEAKER_00]: came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all still illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were criminals over there,
but we never thought that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Neville had that problem in
Western Australia, where they kept him
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think then Ben Dronkers took
over the castle and he was never really
[SPEAKER_00]: very fair in Neville's eyes what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just it was the it was the seed of
discontent, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I can't really talk for for
Neville or anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't we we we actually split in
the 2009 10 around that when CBD crew
[SPEAKER_00]: started to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had to take him off the website
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left everything up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a guy to to take down stuff and
try to pretend it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is still very good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, many people believe that
they knew Neville, but they I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they met him later on in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe it was a different
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all changed in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but I remember him well.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a that's a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've we've been fortunate
enough to speak to a few people who,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, obviously didn't know him as
well as you, but knew him to an extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all sort of echoed a similar
sentiment that, you know, he at times he
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't the most easiest guy to get along
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I've always discussed it as,
you know, maybe there's an element of
[SPEAKER_03]: needing to separate the art from the
artist sort of thing, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nevertheless, let's loop back to just
after those mullum days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what was the progression to
you packing your bags and heading to
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe and jumping headfirst into it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I studied in I went to
High Library College in Melbourne.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from a very different background
and finished a Melbourne uni degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And science degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was landscaping and I was
traveling every three months a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, you know, I bought a house
and renovated it at 22 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of done all the stuff that you
meant to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't really do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought I better I suppose I
had a bit of a kind of inquisitive mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just every time I traveled,
it was like a university of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just open up experiences and
people and foods and cultures and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that you looked at a book, but it was
never the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like, that was two
dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was three dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got addicted to the traveling and I
wasn't meaning to become a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder at any stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just collected things that I liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I didn't want to go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to collect rough stone,
opal and sapphires and stuff in my while I
[SPEAKER_00]: was collecting seeds and fruit seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started getting interested in
gemstones and I ended up in Jaipur in
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have had a motorbike and I would
employ a couple of guys and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up rough opal and selling it in
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that took me to to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the reason why I went originally
there because it was a very big colored
[SPEAKER_00]: stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well known for being colored stone for
gems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went there for that reason with a
bunch of colored stones cut and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: great down my pants and went into Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started going to jewelry places and
I slowly met people in Amsterdam that were
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not like jewelry people in
France.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or England.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty much into smoking and
having a good time and drinking a beer and
[SPEAKER_00]: then talking about making new kind of
settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people were smoking dope
and I was smoking dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had friends that brought in
different hashes from different countries
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'd all start talking and start
exchanging and slowly buying and selling
[SPEAKER_00]: and wheeling and dealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I had such a bunch of seeds,
I kind of was in the back of the mind to
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually find a place to crack these
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suppose in the early 90s,
that's when it started to like a few found
[SPEAKER_00]: some people who were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think it was 92.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Ariane and then by 94 we actually
established the seed company, the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 95 we won.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't enter the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered the second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we won with Whitebeard Owen,
White Rhino and White Shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year we started to, until 98
when I left and we won.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hennebill and I tried, we won about 11 out
of 13 cups that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it was not a planned thing until
it started to show a clear road that this
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to be done in the right country
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Holland was absolutely wonderful
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rest of the world, gave a big
ground to sort of a good base to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand people and different
agricultures and different cultures and
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to explain,
but I mean, it was coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: washing machine specifically for that
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came out and I kind of knew when I
started that I love to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really are solidified that you're
a true collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can add gemstones to the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess my question is, would you say
that that job at Greenhouse with Ariane
[SPEAKER_03]: was sort of your first real industry job?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did you meet Ariane?
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl that I was going out with,
she was a Dutch girl and she was doing all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the interiors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helping Ariane, she was good friends with
Ariane and Brenda, his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got friendly, all four of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked what would be interesting to
keep me in Europe at that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, if we set up a seed
company, it would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really want to be a coffee shop
owner or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I helped with buying materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't really know black ashes and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would be sort of working parallel
with that side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably I convinced him to all
four of us went into that at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was a period of time when
yourself, Ariane and Neville were working
[SPEAKER_03]: for Greenhouse, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that like and what strains came
out of that collaboration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, well, let's just look at it
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ariane had a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, he had two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd worked on the water and built a
waterfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd helped a lot with building up
those things and then buying stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Neville and I were growing separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was growing stuff and I was
growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we were pretty good at our
things, people didn't have these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could offer them to Ariane.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would buy them and put them in the
coffee shop in the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would be the only place you could
get them in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone slowly, Super Silva A's,
for example, Masticush, our versions of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stage, the white widow, the white
rhino that we call it medicine man now,
[SPEAKER_00]: the shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I suppose they were the one,
El Nino was probably the last one that did
[SPEAKER_00]: a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to Mr. Eisen and we did
critical maths and continued.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of always grew and kept our
mothers separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would offer the finished
material to the coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because he paid better money than
everybody else to get the first right of
[SPEAKER_00]: refusal to see everything, everyone wanted
to sell it to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Neville and I, we sold quite,
you know, we set prices at Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took twice as long than Indica's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd have to need twice as much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how the price structure started
to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sort of Dr. Gavalkian
strain came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one time there in the Northern Light
Five Hayes was in the mix there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were always 50% Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would be worth a little bit more
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say if the Indica's, the ones are six
to seven week flowering ones, the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: bud and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were around, say, six thousand
guilders or five, six thousand guilders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Neville's Hayes, which took double,
would be twelve thousand at cost to the
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were making huge money on one kilo
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that inspired people to sort of
compete and try to do a better job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were able to sell stuff to
these places at certain money,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was bragging rights between the
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you got eight grand for
that and not six grand like a commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it improved the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good thing for the whole industry
in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all doing it for the brotherly
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we made money, but it wasn't the
focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all knew we were going to sell it to
one of the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to aim for the highest
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suppose it's like any agricultural
thing that we started to compete,
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville and I, a little bit by that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, he would he would edge
me out most of the time, first and second,
[SPEAKER_00]: many times, you know, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I edged him out before he started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came in and made our name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he started to come in and bring
in Super Sue Hayes and Northern Life Five
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes and various other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it was healthy competition,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all became better growers for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the coffee shops had products
that they were unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you wanted them, you had to go
to their coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a benefit for them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of benefited everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have my Mr. Nice Cedar said
support disorganized crime because that
[SPEAKER_00]: was pretty much what we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no mafia or anything like what
people were romantically believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all all over the place,
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just don't get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the yeah, that was that was all
that we we live by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let any one follow you and don't
don't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love that motto.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Support disorganized crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'd be wondering, when when did
you meet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the other one on the backside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said permanent state of temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on the Mr. Nice T-shirt that we
used to make.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to bring it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so what was your introduction to Howard
and how did you springboard from that
[SPEAKER_03]: point to making Mr. Nice with him?
[SPEAKER_00]: A girl, she's from a mixed race family
from England.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came over and became a client and was
used to buy four or five kilos of
[SPEAKER_00]: different marijuana from us, from me
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we became friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out that her father was a cop
in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of said, well, how did you get
into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, yeah, well, I read this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one time she came over with it
and gave me the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know anything about this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very nice to be around 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started reading the book and put it
down, fucking read the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized I met this guy at the High
Times Cannabis Cup, and he was talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: me in this strange accent Welsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were we just had a funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Report and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year, he came over to
the Milky Way and we actually we won a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things and he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me if if an old bloke like him
had any chance to to start up a business
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said to him, I know who you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I and then we started talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he he just got out of jail in
America was 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was very early, just very early
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and I was 95, 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 96, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just hit it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just the nicest, the most
intelligent gentleman's gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have high, high regards and I
praise for him because he was he was
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely lovely partner and he was a
wonderful human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoyed and, in fact, got inspired to make
the seed company work, so we had more
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons to bump into each other and expose
and and spend time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, we weren't we weren't sort of
motivated by the big bucks and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were more motivated by getting together
to get a few beers and get stoned
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became, you know, sort of quite
regular at certain stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got jobs for talking and doing
the expo lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just I met him through this girl
who was smuggling back to England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by by chance, she gave him the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a kind of there was no no
wonderful outrageous story, but it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: funny story because she contacted me just
recently after many years of not seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, you probably don't remember me,
but I'm this lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and of course, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she she asked me she was living in
Germany now and she's asking me about
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that kind of I lost a lot of
contact with many people due to
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences in life and then we got it
back later on when things became an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: People started to come out of the woodwork
and be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd always as Howard said, we were
unsuccessful criminals because we got
[SPEAKER_00]: caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we became we became kind of faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before that, we were invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you become a face, you have to
change your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like consultant, at least not touching it
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I just made it into the medical
market so we can make it into a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been the focus for the last
since the CBD crew, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brilliant story there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: That.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to quickly ask you before we
look at getting into some of our final
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be your advice for an aspiring
breeder, someone who wants to get into the
[SPEAKER_03]: scene but wants to do it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of a lot of my story in this
world is probably timing and I was at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right place at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I do believe there are other people
out there that have definitely as good
[SPEAKER_00]: goods and have worked on certain lines as
a very private.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is definitely some excellent
people out there that have got some gems.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to bring it to the public is a
very different game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to be ready to to cop
criticism and and go through a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory bodies and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do it legally nowadays is kind of
it's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black was much easier, I must say.
[SPEAKER_00]: White is more red tape and blue tape and
green tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with licensing comes proudness of what
you're doing and holding your head up
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so breeding is yet to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that it's a it's a sought
after job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivating has been a sought after job
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that eventually that will go
back to what will make this company
[SPEAKER_00]: different is the variety or the effect of
the particular plant they've developed
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only available there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be the discerning factor
between companies in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just producing cannabinoid and sort of
regurgitating the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to have something
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I believe breeders will will come
back into being eventually, maybe not for
[SPEAKER_00]: every company, but you know, for many.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hopefully that's some some great
advice there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So moving on to our final five quickfire
questions we'd love to ask Guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is what's your favourite
creation that you've made?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as a follow up, what's a creation
you're fond of that was made by someone
[SPEAKER_03]: else?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favourite to this day is mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt that I've put a lot of
time and effort into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, when I have it, I smoke it
straight away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, proofs in if we have 10
different marijuana's on the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first one that's used is the popular
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's using mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I work it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, it would be very close to
Neville's haze and Super Silva's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of them are up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so so that would be one of the
ones that I would reach for if it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the second part of the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a creation you're fond of that was
made by someone else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I mean, Neville, I mean,
you know, I had I had the best guy to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suppose the Dr. Gavorkian would be
it's I've got it in seed, but I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a living plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I it was another one of Super Silva
haze, mango haze and Dr. Gavorkian were
[SPEAKER_00]: all in the work we were doing together
separately together in just bouncing off
[SPEAKER_00]: each other's idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always loved that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so different aromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like Neville's haze and Super
Silva haze and mango haze together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of it was amazing,
inspiring piece of work that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, we'll have to recreate it
will take quite some searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I remember driving back with
we had to move a room really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was full of Dr. Gavorkian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dad, my father was with me and we're in a
small Panda or something we drove down to
[SPEAKER_00]: his place loaded up the car with green
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That six foot plants and it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I took the whole room in this
small Panda me and my father who is not
[SPEAKER_00]: into that world at all drove like 150 Ks
back to hang it up in our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the effect of the smell got us
so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just such a bonding experience
to have with my my late father was it was
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of it, he loved the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just shows you, you know, he can
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was always very supportive anyway,
and was a good friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was it was the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what a beautiful story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of curiosity, just because I'm
actually not familiar with the Dr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gavorkian strain, is that from the same
genetics that the mango haze and the
[SPEAKER_03]: nevels haze came from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were very, very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a different city, a different
sister selected and then bred and then
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at one stage we were doing we're going
through all of the I think we went through
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Neville must have gone through a
thousand seeds to find super silways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango haze, we went through hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Gavorkian was also one of the ones
that we found one of the ones that Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: had found along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just it was a it was not an
indoor plant, but we did an indoor room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just everybody loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it went out pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some of those we had a lot of
access to many of those kind of strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that no longer exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in retrospect, they taught
you something to make sure that you kept
[SPEAKER_00]: backups and learn how to do mothers and
cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would flower them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you flower them two or three
times to make sure that they were exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, it was it was definitely
from the same line, same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same, same sort of haze combination
with northern lights and skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were those combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, to me, they're building blocks to
this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds incredibly special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we can only hope to try it
ourselves one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've spoken about some really stellar
examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know on the other end of the
spectrum, what's something that really
[SPEAKER_03]: caught on with the masses?
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you tried it, never really spoke
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose there's been a lot of those
strains that other companies felt really
[SPEAKER_00]: good about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't really rock my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm good friends with most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like just now, with all of these,
all of these these things, these cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not a really big fan for all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it doesn't like you said mentioned
earlier that it's got a limited effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do eventually smoke for effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these don't really rock my world
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much as they're wonderful to smell
and they're lovely to look at and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very dense and everything's good about
three out of five traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that hasn't really impressed
me overly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, listen, if I didn't have
anything, I'd be very happy to be given a
[SPEAKER_00]: butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like I'm humble always when it
comes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a certain day, I'll probably find the
things that I'm, you know, sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: criticising might really turn me on if I'm
in the mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very difficult question,
I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, that's a that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can completely agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some days things speak to you more than
others.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next question is, I'm going to drop
you on a desert island.
[SPEAKER_03]: What three things are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a cutting or a pack of seeds
if you want to do some breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you in for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, if I had that, I would take
a pure, a pure haze and a pure indica and
[SPEAKER_00]: a pure skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I could make pretty much the
rest of my plant, my world flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I just had to pick a seed,
seeds to take, I would definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I'm one of these guys that have
always had a pure extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mother and the father would be very
pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can make pretty much everything
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've always kind of thought that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the CBD crew came about by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I suppose I would have to take mango
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to take nautil or critical
mass would be because critical mass has
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it changed a lot of people and
they're all still using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nautil, which was super skunk,
Afghan skunk, it's the one that Howard
[SPEAKER_00]: changed the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to name one after his book in
the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: He refers to the code name of marijuana
was nautil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wanted that to go down in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very good strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a very fast flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't have to wait too long to be
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was on a desert island, I could get
one and then the other one a bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I then mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: do a couple of crops a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could make some seeds and have
my protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I could survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conveniently, there's a lifetime supply of
fertilizer there for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it all works out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So final question for our chat today.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had to restart Mr. Nice with just
one pack of your own stock, what pack
[SPEAKER_03]: would you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: What draws you to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the building block of nearly
every kind of 50-50 haze and sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still find it to be one of the most
reliable strains in our camp, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: ash, Afghan haze by Afghan skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those ones I can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look towards the extreme sides,
the hay side, I could definitely find
[SPEAKER_00]: something towards like Neville haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other side, I could definitely
find some very fast flowering Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity strong narcotic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Afghan haze is a very big
building block for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we make it available to on the
auctions on our website for many members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people would agree
with that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I've tried a few samples of the
angel haze and a few other crosses it's
[SPEAKER_03]: used in and it's gorgeous stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it for this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to get you back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as always, any comments or shout outs
you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just you're predominantly,
I suppose you have a lot of English
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking Australian audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just mean, I'm hoping that we're
starting to export from Switzerland our
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers to Australian medical company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably in January, we get all the
permissions and I will have I think super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver haze, critical mass, the original
shit and pink lemonade, one of the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those four will soon be available as
flowers, dried flowers from Fitoka.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a company that we work with in
Melbourne exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been really good in the sense
that we've been working with them already
[SPEAKER_00]: on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to give a shout out for the
people in Australia who've been asking me
[SPEAKER_00]: where eventually can we try some of those
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, everything will be checked by
me before it leaves Switzerland for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can guarantee you that there'll be
good representation and originals from the
[SPEAKER_00]: original plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd just like to say thank you to
yourself for spending the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't normally do these things,
as I said, but I kind of I realize how
[SPEAKER_00]: important it is for people to learn some
historic references as well and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: get an understanding from someone who was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you don't have to believe
everything I say, but that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: account, according to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope you do well with your
podcasts as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very kind of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we're incredibly appreciative
of your time as always.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a massive thank you to one of the
absolute titans in the cannabis scene,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the last remaining pillars of
modern genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: A huge shout out to Shanti Barber of Mr
Nice.
