[SPEAKER_02]: old school European head, a
preservationist, keeper of the A5,
[SPEAKER_02]: C5, hash plant haze and so many more.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big thank you to Yosami Sam for coming
on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night, my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is great to have you on my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: First question we love to ask people.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mainly I smoke hashish and it's getting
a nuisance to tap into the broader
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties as before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit something that I do
not like.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's less quality import,
but there's still good things to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mainly smoke spliffs actually like
the Europeans do, tobacco hand rolled
[SPEAKER_00]: joints with a lot of hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I talk mainly,
but now in my stash weed-wise is Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, the short pit variety and the new
horizon haze, some A5 and some Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I keep around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, the Band-Aid A7 is just finished
because that's actually my favorite one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You read my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, is that because the
first jar to go empty is the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And C5 of course, also, you know,
usually the best things are smoked first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we touch on some of those
incredible strains you just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to quickly loop back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned talking about hash and how
the cultures changed a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of varieties of hash would you
still feel represent that narrow leaf drug
[SPEAKER_02]: type?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any of the, you know,
imports that still have that old world
[SPEAKER_02]: effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's hard to access them now because
yeah, you know, like the smuggling and
[SPEAKER_00]: these day and age, it's not an easy thing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you, for instance, for me,
the best hashish I ever sampled was
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepalese dry sift from high up the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, you know, it was like it blew
everybody's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff gets you so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you know, it obliterated your
tolerance also, but it was really nice to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke, you know, and taste and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't get that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but hash types like that, they have
that LLD high too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Moroccan is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each has their own unique sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very, they have a lot of
character.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like hashish so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first joint I ever smoked was also
hashish because I liked the smell of that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were totally there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never was interested in cigarettes
because they didn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like smell so nice, but as a teenager,
I, I smelled hashish and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, this stuff, you know, like maybe want
to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, yeah, a revelation,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get high for the first time
and the whole world paradigm changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but for me, it's mainly hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still was, and the ganja of course,
I also appreciate very dearly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like a different league,
so to speak.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a cool experience to have been able
to try that Nepalese hash and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_02]: many others over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of curiosity, do you find yourself
like interested in more modern
[SPEAKER_02]: representations of hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like maybe from the Band-Aid Hayes,
the A5, the C5, or do you feel the magic
[SPEAKER_02]: really lies in those terroir coming from
the Equators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are comparing apples and oranges,
so to speak, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because import hashish, it's from a,
yeah, it has a very different connotation
[SPEAKER_00]: than a one strain extraction, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which doesn't mean it cannot be nice,
but it's like a infused rocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very one-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get this kind of type of variety
hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's boost up and it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really pure and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think concentrates are also really
fantastic, especially for the met people
[SPEAKER_00]: like oils and tinctures also, but in terms
of smoke smoking, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, if you have NLD cultivars,
Dom cultivars like that, they are really
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to concentrate that shit
and smoke it, wow, here, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like good for once in a while,
I think things like that, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not opposed to it, but I'm not a fan
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke it daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do occasionally do adapt,
but I'm not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like my type of smoking, let's say,
because I'm used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a traditional embedded in
our culture here, so to speak.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, when, when you're trying
some of these like, you know, Land Race
[SPEAKER_02]: Origin hashish, do you ever find that you
get an effect that's quite different to
[SPEAKER_02]: say, um, the varieties of flour that are
on offer?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, for example, a lot of sativas,
people think of them as either racy or
[SPEAKER_02]: like clear and stimulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like the hashish from various
different places can offer like a
[SPEAKER_02]: different dimension?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different realms and that's what
the beauty of cannabis as a whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's such a diverse universe actually,
you know, like you have ganja,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have hashish, you have like,
you know, you can do so many things with
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a variety of the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like hard to compare Moroccan
hashish for instance, like the top quality
[SPEAKER_00]: to Nepalese or Kashmir or Afghani,
or like we used to get also Turkish and
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it all got diminished a little bit
because of geopolitical things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a sad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope in the future with the change of
the legislation with this now first and
[SPEAKER_00]: foremost aim that of course, ganja and
everything comes with it, the cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in time, I hope it will spread further
to the countries where these hashish is
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional still being made and we can
access it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, for me, that's the true
richness and the epiphany of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: me personally, because it has this
character that you don't find in modern
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to saying that they are bad or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, you know, it's a different
league of getting high, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I smoke with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a melange more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like a smoker, you know,
we like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that we like dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different thing, you know,
like you also smoke, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and obliterates, it's more direct,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we enjoy the smoking also,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different approach and different
methodology to get high for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like our hash and mainly that's why
the reason why we smoke with tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was like that back in the day,
you just, you know, when the tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: system in Holland started, it was only
hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no indoor grown wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did it to separate the market from
soft and hard drugs because the heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: plague that was across Europe back then,
well, it cost a lot of young people's
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Dutch were then separating the
market to try to fight the heroin traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that came the import hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was mainly the thing here in Holland,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, it then grew further into
Kanja cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually it got completely upside down
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of crazy how things can
evolve over 40 years of time, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, let's come and touch on the
tolerance system in a moment, but I just
[SPEAKER_02]: want to quickly loop back and ask you for
anyone who's interested, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's lots of our listeners who still
visit Amsterdam and Holland regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say is your general
hierarchy of the hash that's currently
[SPEAKER_02]: available?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there still generally speak,
like, for example, would you say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you know, most of the African hash you
get is generally not the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how would you describe the current
state of the land?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a landscape for anyone who wants to
come to Amsterdam and maybe try some hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for my experience at least,
so I'm just like, I'm not really somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes fishing in coffee shops for
hashies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my connection, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the top qualities usually
reside more in like smaller quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they cannot put it for sale because it
just, they only have like limited access
[SPEAKER_00]: to this kind of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sad thing is that I found that
all Tibetan-made hashies and also Indian,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Kashmir and everything, also Turkish,
like Lebanese, it also vanished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now only having Moroccan
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a big change there,
of course, with the modern cultivars that
[SPEAKER_00]: are being imported there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still traditionally made Moroccan
hashies, but they don't use necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: the old cultivars from back in the day,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also a little bit of change in
that, but, you know, great hashies is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's like, it gets you high in a
certain realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very nice to sit around with,
you know, like people smoke and have some
[SPEAKER_00]: tea and, you know, like talk and discuss
about life, philosophate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more that vibe that it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the taste and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in coffee shops, you know, it's hard to
really determine the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, I don't visit them so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really assess their quality so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do know is that import hashies is
like in the background now, it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: modern hashies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's isolated or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually they're also made not from the
traditional cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like these modern extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the market in that sense has
changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me personally, as a hash favorite
from the hash countries, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not so great evolution, but of course
we still have the great ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one must not complain and,
you know, be happy with what we still got
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to increase it in the future as
good as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a beautiful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few questions ago, you mentioned the
tolerance system in Holland and how that
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of played out over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you give an overview of the
scene currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe the Amsterdam scene
to people as it is now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Amsterdam scene, so I come from
the south of Holland and so I was more
[SPEAKER_00]: like secluded from the Amsterdam scene
because yeah, what we had here with these
[SPEAKER_00]: hazes and these hashies people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so we went frequently to Amsterdam
because it's a nice city to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we did some coffee shops,
but usually the gear that was in our
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket, we found superior than the gear
that they were offering because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little bit of a commerce thing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are still nice, so in Amsterdam
was always nice things to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, you know,
it was the capital of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say for many, many years while the
whole world was still repressing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dutch were the only one to like,
yeah, like I said, tolerate it because to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect actually their youngsters from
getting killed by other mean drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a good thing, but yeah,
over time it changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now with the legislation, it changed in
America, of course, you have this wave of
[SPEAKER_00]: like tsunami of more North American
strains, the cushions and the cakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say that kind of come flooding
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's a popular thing here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the youngsters, it's like this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market is continuous flux also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these hives will eventually blow
over and you know, cannabis, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more for the people also, it's for the
broad people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it must be accessible to all,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, the true passionados,
let's say, well, they always steer to the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of things and not so much the
hives and they stick around, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, would you say in general that
the majority of the people involved in the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene slash the industry in Holland are
more of the old school sort of heady
[SPEAKER_02]: nature and they're looking for those older
effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it like most places in the world
where there's still quite a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: majority of people who are into the more
newer, modern hype sort of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, the Amsterdam market
wasn't so purely Dutch actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for instance, a lot of people
from other countries are there to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish themselves there to work this
plant and to be a part of the community
[SPEAKER_00]: that later evolved to become an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like Nevo also did his work in
Holland, Sam the skunk man brought his
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody came to Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Amsterdam was actually a
metropolitan that attracted various people
[SPEAKER_00]: from over the whole world to work this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are only few really Dutch
people that do this also that still reside
[SPEAKER_00]: from back in the day before actually the
indoor ganja scene and the coffee shop
[SPEAKER_00]: market exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are still Dutch people in
Amsterdam, but I wouldn't call Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like purely Dutch in that
perspective in terms of who works plants
[SPEAKER_00]: there and who provides we to people,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like an international collective
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few people from Amsterdam
that kind of represent the more Dutch kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of approach to it, let's say, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hazes and everything incorporates
with it because it's the cradle actually
[SPEAKER_00]: of the modern hybrids more or like the
hybrids from before where the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids are made from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Amsterdam is more like, yeah,
like I say, a metropolitan for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it magnetized a lot of people
throughout the world for years to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: the city to, you know, to be involved in
the cannabis because they also love
[SPEAKER_00]: getting higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's got like a brewery,
a mix of great people that come in about
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, you know, like really try to
grow good wheat and enhance the gene pool
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a good thing,
but that goes for the whole of Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam is the heart of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have also Rotterdam and then
the Brabant area and the South Limburg and
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeland where actually also a lot of
people and then you have coffee shops
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but Amsterdam has this
alluring thing to it because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: capital of Holland and it's a nice cozy
city, you know, I mean coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's renowned.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good thing, but I wouldn't call
it necessarily only Dutch this approach
[SPEAKER_00]: there in Amsterdam, considering the
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more Dutch, you have to go
into the country and maybe go to the South
[SPEAKER_00]: or to the North.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a better assumption of
what truly Dutch coffee shops are and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they serve.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say, because, you know,
I encountered these, so cannabis came into
[SPEAKER_00]: my life in the late eighties, mid to late
eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got in touch with Hayes in like
93 in the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first smoked my Hayes joint in
93, I was so impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I want to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to meet these people who are
like, whoa, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was so from that day on I
was into Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was no rival to it,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kept it also in a tight group of
people and a tight crew because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: so widespread available, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really fell for the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what else emerged from other
cannabis, I followed up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but once you like, I started
cultivating Hayes in 93 also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you start cultivating plants
like this, these old hair looms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you try another variety, you're like
not impressed by it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of ditch it and we stayed to
the Hayes, like loyal, true Hayes freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so nothing else could compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever the story about the white
widow is, I don't know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but Ingemar plays a part in it,
I think a very big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's not a bad variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like all cannabis, let's make no
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, all cannabis is good,
but I have my own personal preference and
[SPEAKER_00]: like this NLD kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it was the old hair looms that I
encountered that from there, my knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: also grew and I got, yeah, interested in
the NLD and the more psychoactive tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these plants, yeah, they have
character.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are jungle plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like these uniform,
more tweaked plants to, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different league.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go for the jungle plants any and
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a beautiful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to ask you, you know,
you just mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some jungle varieties,
as you put it, you might recommend to
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are looking to expand their
pallets, but have only ever really had
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of more modern representations of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that's, that's, you know,
when you start doing these other varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to go to a haze, well,
usually they don't, well, it's a totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different league.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, normally they try it once or
twice and then they ditch it because like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, they're not used to like having
these jungle plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you, if you want to
cultivate weed or you're like a real
[SPEAKER_00]: passionist and you usually go for the
varieties you want, you prefer yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it was the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first seeds I sprouted was actually
scones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I moved to Spain for a little
while and there was not any marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: there, not anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to grow my own to have some
because it was all hushies there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was in favor because back then we
had some good grass here in the coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shops in Holland too, but not the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I encountered the haze,
I was like so blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to, you know, smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I then smoked so much of it that these
people kind of said, man, seriously,
[SPEAKER_00]: you take so much, maybe you should grow
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it then eventually I became
then a cultivator of these varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, like you have a personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these plants so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other plants don't impress me so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that they are not nice,
but cultivation is like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love to tame these wild beasts,
you know, and get them into like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes longer and a lot of more
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of cultivators, they also want to
more guarantee their results, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the modern varieties, well,
they're easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have more like, and they don't take
so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that kind of aspect, I can only,
you know, I encourage any ganja growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what strains they put under the
light or the sun, for that matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all marijuana is good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But personally, I would recommend to try
some of these great ganja plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: these queens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a beautiful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess one of the questions we do get
from our listeners very often is they're
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of after like recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question I hear a lot is that
there are people who are keen to sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: dip their toes in the waters of the NLD
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, look, you know,
I'm happy to run something that goes a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to experience the feeling
that, you know, the guests describe on the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything that you might be
able to recommend that's like a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: days or less?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, it depends on personal
preference also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to have a haze,
then you should grow a proper haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's available on the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are a lot of people that are
doing nice, small things, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like in the realm of the people
that really have heart for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're industrialized,
this passion, let's say, you lose
[SPEAKER_00]: something also a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not opposed to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when you work a hundred
thousand plants or you work a hundred,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it's a world of difference,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like with making wines or like the
finer things of life, Cuban cigars,
[SPEAKER_00]: you name it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single malt whiskeys, whatever,
champagnes, whatever you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's finesse in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want finesse, then you have to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these heirlooms represent it,
but there are many other land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you like the Thai,
which actually, I think it's more coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from Laos or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also debatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we all have our personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can cultivate that, well,
then you have what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it depends what you want.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, like super silver haze is still
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango haze, I personally found mango haze
one of the better varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are also a little bit more easy
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the wildness, the vigor is a little
bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're more practical for like the
average grower, so to speak, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a nice variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I like it very much in high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that, I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, of course, the things that I'm
working on myself, you know, what I do now
[SPEAKER_00]: is collaborating with the original Dunkin
coffee shop in Holland to make some small
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds and then offer some unique lines to
the public, you know, to access and to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will be also around a hundred
days, give and take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like my seeds to be like the
authentic thing that can have also this
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe to them, like from the hay side,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we all aim about.
[SPEAKER_00]: To enhance the haze or like to preserve it
as good as we can, this high, this
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling, okay, because it's a certain
unique vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more deep, let's say, okay,
than any other high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Sativa hybrid or like an NLD hybrid
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it is, it's debatable,
but it's clearly like fire, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all agree on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you love it, well, you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are Tibetan varieties,
for instance, that are also really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you have a land race variety
growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it will change, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have a harsh cultivar in a harsh
environment and, you know, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains of Tibet, while there it
thrives, let's say, if you take it out or
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed and it's on here and you put it
in, you know, under indoor conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you get a totally different
expression in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's therefore not necessarily better,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but what's on the market, you know,
I, you know, look at to the passionados,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always say, you know, like,
and there are nice things on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the gene pool by people that are
preserving plants and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing them what they preserved,
making it available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it enhances the gene pool a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something very important,
I think, towards the future, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like cannabis is going to revolutionize
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this plant is so versatile,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to, the broader humanity needs
to educate itself a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it will come and the interest grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the immaturity of like the
market, it's sometimes saddening,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that amplifies also like things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is in continuous flux,
like I say, so things evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have this latent hemp phyroid
that is also nuisance, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of things are being shipped
worldwide now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this latent hemp phyroid,
it's not really detectable for the average
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it's in your plant, and you
utilize the same scissors, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, for you get an infected plant,
and you're not aware of it, but it infects
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole library in a year time,
you can throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are a number of people in the
industry that's putting their heads into
[SPEAKER_00]: the sand and don't want to hear about it,
but it's a real threat, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should really pay attention and
educate ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to keep it free,
because this phyroid, wow, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential threat to certain varieties,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't make good precautions,
it could be a threat, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since everything is sent abroad and not
being checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I see a lot of plants that are
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so there's a big discussion and
people are not aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the AIDS of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like the similar vibe to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like a taboo almost,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it needs simple precautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to clean your tools with
bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you can safeguard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so if you have things sent to you,
I would say to everybody in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, pay attention, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it can ruin your credentials and
endanger preservation towards the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you must have my list of
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just touched on so many great talking
points.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to loop back on several of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, while we're on the topic,
the hoplite enviro does certainly seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: have sort of died down out of the
mainstream zeitgeist and discussion and
[SPEAKER_02]: feels like it's sort of like a bit out of
sight, out of mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the state of things like in the EU
at the moment from your perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's your sort of biggest fear in
regards to the viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I too share similar concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that, well, in most
European countries, the official
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation to cultivate recreational
cannabis is still not implied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still waiting on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only like the medical market that
can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that we cannot lab test our
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available, but it's quite expensive,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so there are a lot of things getting
shipped worldwide now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a potential threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I want to talk about it
because people don't want to hear so much
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's also like powdery mildew and
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can assess it immediately or like
spider mites or any other pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this viroid not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you know, you think this
plant is healthy and then it deteriorates
[SPEAKER_00]: over like a half year, say, when I put
this on the vetch, then you will see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's too late, especially if you
make seeds with it, because you send it
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, its progeny will contain at least
30% of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the seeds will be also containing this
viroid, but potentially also infecting
[SPEAKER_00]: again, other cannabis gene pools and
genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important we keep that a
little bit in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if we're going to revolutionize
the world with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to be prudent about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's say it's not like it's just a
pest as any other, but rinsing your tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, with some bleach,
it takes a little bit more effort than
[SPEAKER_00]: time, maybe, but it's well worthwhile,
okay, to keep everything a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like with any other organism,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you truly love it, you want to be able
to that it's, you know, in the best
[SPEAKER_00]: condition as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not to be something
underestimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see in the industry from top to
bottom, let's say people in it that they
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer to be not going to talk or they say
our plants are caught clean while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, so I'm just giving out the shout out
to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they pay attention to this viroid
because seriously, it's a threat and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you know, we can keep it out of
our gardens as good as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think everyone obviously,
you know, the goal is to try to stop it
[SPEAKER_02]: from getting into their gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I then wonder, do you think this
will be something where we may be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually eradicate it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it'll just become one of
those things that like floats around in
[SPEAKER_02]: the background?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the flu, like you get it some
years, you don't, other others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I see it as a potential threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people do not take this seriously to
lose some potential lines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available, for instance, because the
potentials once they're infected,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we cannot make seeds with it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can make seeds with it,
but then you have to really lab test it
[SPEAKER_00]: for it to contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is, we have the technology to
prevent it and, you know, to fight it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all here and we just have to do the
necessary, you know, put the effort in and
[SPEAKER_00]: not like be lightheaded about it or like
rather not hear about it because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that seriously, you know,
if a breeder makes seeds and send it to
[SPEAKER_00]: people, and he's not aware of it itself,
that it's in his branch as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these people accessing the seeds will
have plants that contain this virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that sense, it's like better to
prevent it than to suffer from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, it takes some prevent,
you say like things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you can sleep sound at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not in your library.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest that everybody just pay
attention and educate himself or herself a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about this virus to keep it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that will ensure that we do not
lose seed lines or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the genotypes and the cannabis
varieties that will then be infected and
[SPEAKER_00]: downgraded and we just have to kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be eliminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, you know, it is something
that we are able to eliminate in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, I want to talk about some of
your breeding, but you know what,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would help first to lay a bit
of the groundwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we go back to the start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about your first
experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first experience was this hashies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at the festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like just 16 or just not just before
I got 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we were at the festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy was rolling a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it before, but you know,
it was now close and it was somebody from
[SPEAKER_00]: my own group of friends or like people I
knew, let's say the locals, but he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit older and he saw I was
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, you know, he rolled a joint
and then he said, yeah, I want to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this whole festival got kind of,
yeah, everything enhanced, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole sphere and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked the aroma coming from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was mesmerizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first experience was a really
good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so you get interested and then I
lived close at the border with Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I not touch myself, but I leaped over
the border then said, because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tolerance system in Holland,
I really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to get high and all these
hashes available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah,
this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then it stayed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, also wheat,
you know, we like both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we smoked wheat and we smoked mainly
ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wheat back then it was usually
skunk or skunk hybrids more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were nice, but not really like
flabbergastering nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teenagers, you know, how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I said, I was a little bit
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like before I got 20, I was sitting in a
bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a normal bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some bars in Holland, you could also
smoke, you know, like a sticky we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a hand-rolled cigarette,
but a small one, not a really big joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just like smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also tolerated back then,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in certain bars anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this guy comes sitting next to me
and I knew him, you know, we knew him from
[SPEAKER_00]: like going out to him, I'd say,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he said, you want to try something?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah, skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah, smoke this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, what it is, it's a haze,
a five haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I rolled one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, we always rival
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking this guy, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had a little drink also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really I went to the toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's this?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love immediately with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had weed like that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it blew my mind in every
possible way, in every positive way also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like hooked from that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so shortly after I, you know,
I was so interested and blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to meet people that offered
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so shortly after I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so I got into a whole different
group of people that held hashies and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a very different way than in
the coffee shop or like the more
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial scene in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were more, also they were older than
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like the age of, they were the
Dutch hippies, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more activists also very political
engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they wanted to also reform
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they believed in this plant also and
the hashies and everything and tolerated
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all always dreamed in that,
you know, the early nineties that it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be legal by 2020 at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 2000, we thought in the best case
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still hasn't happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are waiting forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, this completely aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was so blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I loved it and my friends also
loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like getting this haze for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all like back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no competition for this week
because this group of people I
[SPEAKER_00]: encountered, well, they tapped into them,
these cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were the first to grow it to
really full potential.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so then it shines and then it
becomes what it should be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you don't know how to cultivate
it, well, it can be a stack of hay also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but these people really were
the first to, you know, produce this haze
[SPEAKER_00]: to full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it blew our minds back then
and we fell in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it grew from there and started
cultivating short after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it was a fantastic time
throughout the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was really a lot of hope and
prosperity and looking at the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would all change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a good way, and actually,
you know, that the legislation got
[SPEAKER_00]: actually far worse with the coffee shelves
booming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it kind of got out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of French and Belgian people and
German people, they flooded the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: borderlines to get their beets and hash
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like Europe was facing a little
problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Dutch government got tapped on
their shoulder like, Hey, what the fuck is
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all our youngsters are going buy
drugs in your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they made like crazy legislation then
to reform the border areas while Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Rotterdam area were then in a
different kind of legislation while the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole country was actually under the same
legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you know, it's like the most
surreal thing ever.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot, nobody makes up shit like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to laugh with it and think
like, Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit longer to just like cultivate
out in the open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into the hobby spheres here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for us, it's a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really some, it's a lifestyle
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, it's not something we
do for to enrich ourselves to share money
[SPEAKER_00]: wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we all want comfortable lives,
but that's not the aim.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aim is to get high as motherfuckers
and to benefit from it and to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: something to the table for others that can
say, Hey man, this is really something
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to maintain that finesse and
you know, it's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only for the people that really like
it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people also, they get anxious
or paranoid from it and they kind of steer
[SPEAKER_00]: away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they prefer a little push cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an epic story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many details I feel like we need to
touch on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the first one is this crew you're
talking about, are they the people online
[SPEAKER_02]: referred to as the A5 crew?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a follow-up, did they ever tell you
like the story of getting the cutting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so these people were passionados and
so they lived in the same area where
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville did his first work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them, there were actually three
people, one of them, he was, so Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: and him became friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because these people were in the,
you know, they were, so they loved
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics, let's say, but first and
foremost, Hushies, they were really hush
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the top quality varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these top shelf quality Hushies,
they also impressed Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he smoked some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they got acquainted more better,
let's say, okay, by the Hushies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they became social to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Neville actually provided these
cuttings also like to share them with,
[SPEAKER_00]: also to get better grapes on his own
breedings, because these people cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: it to, you know, to deliver some haze on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that helped them also to maintain
their top quality Hush trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all kind of in that regard that
there was this exchange was being made
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Neville did his first readings and
these people got handed out five
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes of every breed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they kept them all like more,
I'm not sure of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many they actually saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always kind of looked up to them with
the greatest respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really nice, lovely,
you know, like regular people that did it
[SPEAKER_00]: from their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have a coffee shop while one
of them later did have, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was a different, it was more a
family thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say, you know, like really a
group of friends that share things with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so they were the first to really
realize how important these plants were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were also the initiators of the
preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we in our little collective here and
some people also in a different part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the site took upon themselves to safeguard
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When later in around the millennium
change, the legislation in Holland changed
[SPEAKER_00]: so hard and these people were targeted by
justice really hard.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then everything came to an end,
the glory days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we salvaged what we could
salvage from that brutal error and went
[SPEAKER_00]: underground with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To safeguard it and preserve it for over
all these years, because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we always recognized the initiators
especially, but we also the smokers that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I could tap into it and then
later cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all recognize the sheer unprecedented
extra ordinary power that resides in these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the high speaks for itself,
the plants morphology when you grow it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you compare it to like other breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cultivars away.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to know how to cultivate
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise they just keep on growing and
then like you have a lot of vegetable of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetatable growth, but not really the
flowers you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I was privileged and blessed to,
you know, like this happened and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: more like a Southern Dutch thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville with his breeding took it later to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was his breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so the preservation of the old clones,
it was done in the South by people that
[SPEAKER_00]: really, you know, like I love these plants
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, for me, these plants are like
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been keeping them around,
you know, and initiated from the day
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville bred them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like mid to end eighties and then
later like 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the exchanges were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like from there on, we kept them
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when justice then hits these people
hard, yeah, we took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to save what was salvageable and
took it underground and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve it for future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also wanted to in our stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we love these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, yeah, it's almost like your
children and nobody takes it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You care for it and protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also a collective thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot do it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything like that, because people get
raided or when you have pests or like
[SPEAKER_00]: something happens, you know, we all have
our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we all have our traumas in
life and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, by this collective effort,
we are, wow, it's been a remarkable
[SPEAKER_00]: journey keeping these heirlooms now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still into our human reality,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great thing, you know,
every time I talk on them, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a privilege, but also a severe
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good that they are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now they are made available for the
broader public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of people can access
them better and better in one form or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I, for me, it's all about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preserving them, meaning also shipping
them to places where they have legal
[SPEAKER_00]: grounds to have, you know, to be preserved
for longer than just us.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will be around when we are
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best day scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an epic story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to ask, you mentioned a few times
that you've made your best efforts to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve what was salvageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which cuttings do you have as far as I had
heard, it was like the A5, the C5,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Hashplant Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any others?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's the G13 crossed to the Haze
A that we managed to safeguard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is, of course, the
Neville's Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also one of the first Neville's Haze
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was selected for its certain
morphology and everything from back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, back in the day,
it really stood out to other plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like these people that love them
so much and could tap into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were people around them with
green thumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Dutch are really good in
agriculture, let's say.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whatever it is, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a university also that is
really one of the top leading universities
[SPEAKER_00]: and like the science behind how to
cultivate crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, this knowledge from the Dutch
then combined with the ability to tap into
[SPEAKER_00]: this genetics properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so then it could manifest it to what
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like it has to be grown to proper,
to really make it shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the commercial scene rather
stay away from it because when you fuck it
[SPEAKER_00]: up, well, you're a half year further and
you don't have any proper return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can only do it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fuck up twice, you are a year
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you have a big investment and you
don't get a return in one year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a problem.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all go for the more easy return.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commercial thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Haze is not so easy to be capitalized
on except when it's growing to with the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are really can, you know,
that they know what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it can manifest itself to
something really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, like I said, it's not for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a niche market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's one of the, maybe the key
elements also that helps us enable us to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, you know, have a little influence
now on human awareness that yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hashi is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about that, but people just do
not get it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But believe me, Hashi is the pinnacle of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you really understand it,
you know, it's like you understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ganja is great too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it's a different, so it's more
spiritual for me, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a deeper level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has something sacral to it,
you know, something sacred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ganja also, every cannabis has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less, but the ones I love,
they have it in a certain higher degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love psychedelics myself too.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think psychedelics in the future also
will be very important to pave the way in
[SPEAKER_00]: human awareness and consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this world, seriously,
in this day and age, people are still
[SPEAKER_00]: beating the shit out of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hey, maybe I'll smoke a joint,
you know, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant for me is like really
important to bring it into, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it more accessible for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how they take it, I think it's a
very good ally in our voyage here on this
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to listen to it really and educate
ourselves and put it more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: foreground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a slow process, but I'm thinking
we're gaining some momentum finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, you hear ripples about that
sort of worldwide currently, which is good
[SPEAKER_02]: to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an epic array of plants that,
you know, I think these are probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: only remaining plants that like Neville
selected himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a follow up, could you give the
listeners an overview or a description?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how would you describe each of
these plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: They sound absolutely legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I first want to say this,
so and back in that day when these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were first created, let's say,
and exchanged, so they were a new thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were like, yeah, it was like I
knew everybody away, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, like I said, Neville went down on,
so it was more, he was the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for him, it was making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these people in the South,
well, they had a different approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they embraced these plants in a
different regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they kept them secure and safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also secluded from the more commercial
realms in Holland back in that day,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also these people were not looking
for any spotlight, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want any green merchant thingy
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just wanted to smoke and get
high and like, you know, have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and hush available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they embraced these plants with a
different attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they became the first preservationist
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later we took it upon ourselves
to, like I said, salvage was salvageable
[SPEAKER_00]: because we also love these plants by then
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so preserving these plants,
well, it sounds a different, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I actually was preserving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that they were like haze hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for them, they always said that the
NL5 haze hybrids were the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like C5, A5, and that was haze,
or had the highest quality and potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also with the G13 and the highest
plant, they were nice cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then we had also Durbin across to
these haze varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lost that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the CG13, we lost that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost here in the vicinity, then the A5
due to mislabeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later I hooked up with some people
that were I had interactions with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: people I had interactions with in the
center of the South, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were thankfully able to preserve
the A5 that we lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we then were able to preserve the
AG13, the harsh plant haze, the Nettles
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, and the C5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, these were the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were the queens of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time, some hermed, some were less
resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over time, a lot of things
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been cloned so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key element in keeping them healthy
for us was also you cannot keep plants
[SPEAKER_00]: under artificial light continuously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to revitalize them,
preferably each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we take them like in the springtime
here, we have an ideal veg climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late spring, and early summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can put them like two,
three months outdoors in the soil and get
[SPEAKER_00]: them sun and get them in the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they revitalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we clone them again and take them
indoors to be able to keep them vital
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the winter, okay, because they
won't survive out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we do it and kept them in
good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the preservation of these plants,
well, so and usually in the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote, industry, they're like two
streets, they say breeding and cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: and or, okay, but I think preservation is
actually the one that exceeds or tops
[SPEAKER_00]: these two because preservation,
whether it's in seed form, or especially
[SPEAKER_00]: in plant form, well, it's very,
you know, important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an extra ordinary heirloom
that's really, you know, blows your mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, or you have more of them,
well, you want to preserve them,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants phenotypical expressions preserving
like we did, is of course different than
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: With seeds, you never know what comes out
of it, but it's equally important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plant preservation, well, it's a
living organism, you have to keep alive
[SPEAKER_00]: over all these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a multitude on it,
well, it's not such an easy thing when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working in a climate that finds
growth continuously and harasses like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and considers to be a criminal
and we're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the way, here is a coffee
shop, you can buy it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why can I not grow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little bit strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm not complaining because
the Dutch still are tolerant towards it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the penalties for it, it's like,
okay, but it's changed also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now your house can be taken away and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time for the legislation to this
change so that, and they have to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from like the alcohol industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have microbreweries and you have big
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's each to their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have single mouths and that model
of doing business would fit cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: really good, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they consider it still as a
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I don't know what it is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all need to smoke some haze,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will maybe get a little
quicker because seriously, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very immature market and it's a
sad thing when you're a mature smoker in
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of thing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make something beautiful out of it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I can only imagine all the effort
it's taken to preserve those cuts over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years in the climate you described.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kudos to you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, on that point itself,
you've just given us a great tip about how
[SPEAKER_02]: to store plants long-term with the
revitalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have a lot of listeners chime in
and say, do you have any other tips you
[SPEAKER_02]: might have for preservationists to help
keep cuts around in the long-term?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other little tips or tricks
for keeping them happy, maybe in the
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor period?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're working on the legislation
that are unfriendly, then you have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a group collective, because if
you're the only one and you get raided or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever in the worst case scenario,
or you have a pest and it dies or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, well, you don't have any
backups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So backups are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to preserve a certain
cultivar, you need to have it at different
[SPEAKER_00]: locations, even in legal climate,
by the way, because somebody can get like
[SPEAKER_00]: the latent hemp fire out or what,
and it's not aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: So backups are important and keep them
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them short and make new cuttings
regularly so everything is optimized as
[SPEAKER_00]: good as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do like two generations during
the winter time, and then that generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the third, will go outside when I make
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to keep my mums as fresh and in mint
condition as possible, because under
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial light, it deteriorates,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot keep plants forever happy,
no matter in what soil, and so it sinks a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, it gets hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my mums usually on soil,
not on hydro, because I think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: better buffer and it's also more organic,
so it's a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I have multiple cuttings of each
cultivar that you want to protect also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only one, because if something
happens with it, you lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so keep them happy, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep them green, let's say,
and don't overfeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like rainwater for the majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like organic fertilizer, and sometimes I
give them a little salt like I do for
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro to give them a little boost,
like when I want to make cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I like letting them veg a little
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do small operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, cutting making is not such a
big thing, so I can do it like more,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can keep my things as vital as I
possibly can over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You accumulate also a little bit
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep them also bonsai-styled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like big mums, because big mums,
mums will only produce possible pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they breed a lot, and so they damp a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: By keeping them smaller and bonsai-ing
them and keeping them healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a small miniature version,
but you can put more plants also in a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a practical thing for me as a more
hobbyist, let's say, okay, if you have big
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, it's like, you have to work in
these layers of frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the important thing is like,
yeah, keep them healthy, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't overfeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of overfeeding in the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to really, it's better
that they pay out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you give them some extra so you know
what your dose is, at least if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, you see also what the plant
needs, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better to underfeed it a tad,
see it, and then adapt new to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to overfeed it and burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives stress to plants, and it tends to
also get into the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stress out a plant too much,
it can may possibly hermodyte on you or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's in the mother plant,
you're stressing it, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not so good keeping your mother
plants in healthy and mint condition is
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I say preservation comes
first, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, you can take cuttings
and do some breeding work or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cultivate or whatever, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first thing is keeping the paranchals
and mint condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's first and foremost, keeping the
mums, the paranchal stock clean and vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant sentiment there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it does take some time to
get a mastery on keeping those mums
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit still something I'm always
trying to improve on.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're on the topic of preservation,
I want to quickly ask you, a topic that
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly pops up when we're discussing
some of these older world genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in the context of stuff that's
still on offer today, is this idea that
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe some of the older Amsterdam or Dutch
based cannabis companies have lost some of
[SPEAKER_02]: their mothers over the years and they get
replaced with different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something that you have
experienced yourself and do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: there are like any companies on the market
like that are still offering sort of that
[SPEAKER_02]: real original old school authentic stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because I have my select niche
interest market, I do not really access
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't know, but I read some on the
boards and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, you know, like I say,
preservation is a hard thing when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working under climate that, you know,
doesn't really promote ganja growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a parentals or whether it's
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they all see it as cultivation,
the justice department, they see every
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana plant as a possible money
benefit, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they target it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they also radio,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're preserving plants and
keeping a library, well, it's a nuisance
[SPEAKER_00]: because they destroy everything.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that a lot of people in the
Amsterdam scene or Dutch scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter where they are, they got
severely targeted and lost parentals for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only say that we kept what we kept
and that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what others do with their parentals,
well, it's up to theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I see a lot of claims of
this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then I follow up on the people
that access them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see and establish for
yourself, which is what I'm watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like there's a wise man once said
that, you know, people like plants or like
[SPEAKER_00]: people like plants, not that they don't
lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants will reveal everything you
want to know about certain pedigrees and
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, possible loss of parentals with
certain seed brands or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I say, it's not usually like they
want this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, because, yeah, it's like,
you still get targeted for keeping plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a library gets like raided,
yeah, you lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to tap in some seed
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that holds the, like a sister or a
brother plant to what you had as parental.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's done a different phenotypical
expression and that could tamper possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed line that you are making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the offspring will then be different,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over time, over all these years
that seeds are being produced and certain
[SPEAKER_00]: seed lines are being offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course there will be loss of
parentals and everything that comes with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cannot point my finger at anybody
that's doing it because well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the privilege of having these plants
around is also that when I later then went
[SPEAKER_00]: on the boards and I could understand what
we were actually were preserving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start meeting people from the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you start connecting to people
in the community that are also doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same, okay, passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am interchanged with them mostly
to tap into seed lines that I find them
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of our restrictions here and
under this climate that we have to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are also, we have to keep an eye into
our plant accounts and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sometimes a nuisance when you
want to tap into seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but from experience, I can say that,
you know, like compared to these old
[SPEAKER_00]: heirlooms, it's hard to find the plant
morphology speaking, I mean, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily say that there are better
plants in potency on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in morphology speaking, like the sheer
wild power that is in these heirlooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I tried a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only a few that can stand next
to them and rival them, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a special unique kind of
vigor in them, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to find that in modern
seed breeds, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this because everything over the
years got over hybridized a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then that's why it's important to
have these genetic and pure forms still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can to be made and cannot wait to
tap into my own seed vault that I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the legislation will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there will be something nice to
emerge because like I say, this network of
[SPEAKER_00]: personalities of people that are,
you know, like also preserving certain
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that are mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to be, it's going to be a
great thing towards the future once the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation will change, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then meanwhile, we just keep it
secluded and do small operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, yeah, that's like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, you've got my ears perked up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to ask you, you know, if you were
in that legal climate, you describe
[SPEAKER_02]: what's, you know, some seeds from the
vault you'd be interested in being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: crack, you know, what's some rare seeds
that you're looking forward to getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, you know, like we'll reveal that
when it's time, but I could say it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: NLD leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like with cultivars also that
have been preserved by people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, yeah, for me, it's like
the NLD varieties, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we all know that the haze,
it's more derived from Columbia and Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, like Southeast Asia that
tie possibly, but there are, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: an abundance of land races in the world
that people have to attend to and also do
[SPEAKER_00]: a little work with to, you know,
mix with other things and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, establish something that's also
remarkable and can stand on its own,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm hoping that when the
legislation here in Europe starts
[SPEAKER_00]: changing, that this transatlantic and also
preferably Australia and actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like the global, hopefully then
it will go global, but let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the countries of interest,
let's say, well, then we can establish
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are unprecedented then because
these two worlds will then be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: merge in a better way, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for now, well, I don't have
interest into starting an American or
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, okay, I grew up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm waiting for this legislation to
change and then it will be, so the hobby
[SPEAKER_00]: work that we do, it holds a certain value,
but when you want to throw a lot of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have, you know, and do selections
better also to establish your branches to
[SPEAKER_00]: go for, especially the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can only do that in a legal
framework, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I'm waiting to do my
work here once it's allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for now, yeah, we also do nice work
because over the years we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: refine a certain, so by, you start reading
plants, let's say, okay, and you are
[SPEAKER_00]: better aware of the seed lines that you
want to tap into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Vietnamese and Southeast
Asians and the Laos and like pure Durban
[SPEAKER_00]: from South Africa, you know, there's some
fire there really, that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: remarkable also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe other Chinese is a little bit
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain Afghan varieties also
that I like, but you know, because
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan is a country that makes a lot
of hashish, so the hybridization there is
[SPEAKER_00]: also a strong thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't, so it's like a little bit,
yeah, I'm more a traditionalist in that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of way, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I do not have anything against
hybridization because these hash hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: are also hybrids, I mean, but over
hybridizing you get, then it blends out
[SPEAKER_00]: too much, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't go really for that
characteristics that are really embedded
[SPEAKER_00]: in a certain strain and like pure form,
let's say, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it diluted and more, and that's a
little bit what I want to steer away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more go to the pure things and cross
pure things that you can actually say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is not like 5AC, for instance,
C5 cross to Vietnamese black, and then do
[SPEAKER_00]: a large selection out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the parability, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never know what the progeny will be
between two kinds of cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they will intermix and how the,
yeah, the overall, so you have to test it
[SPEAKER_00]: and be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, to do these NLDs,
so they're all on flowering varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes also a little bit more time to do
it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the evaluation and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's my goal, you know,
to bring really that finance to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the market will be ready for it,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meanwhile, I do work and I consider
that to be the, you know, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: foreplay, let's say, of what's to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I'd love to hear a little bit
about some of the hybrids you offer
[SPEAKER_02]: through the current Dramking seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the creations are you responsible
for and how would you describe them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, so I made the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I created the mail that was C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always liked the C5 very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the queen of the hazes in
potency wise, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also delivers nice, but she's very
finicky to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you don't grow it, it can be a
very difficult, especially indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the most favorable cultivar to
grow, but I like it's high and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: grown to full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, so it's the only one I can
talk daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, okay, A5 or Neville Hays for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like nice for a little while,
but then, you know, like it has this dark
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaustiveness about it that I personally,
for my personal preference, do not like so
[SPEAKER_00]: much in my daily routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke that shit for too long
while it puts you in a different realm,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, okay, not the best one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So C5 is more like the more playful one
and I always liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I was thinking about what to cross
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did some crossings with Malawi first
to see if that brings some, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi is a marsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really the most loud strain,
let's say, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a certain zang to it, but it's not
really loud like cushions or like cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought this African variety
would allow me to bring some of the C5
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I made the new Horizon Hays with
these males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first interactions with
these plants to make them, out-crust them
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I became a member of Mr. Nice
Board and he offered five Hays C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different form, but it's in the
same family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd tap into these seeds to
see if there was an interesting male to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross on the C5 and then have like an IVL
more so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to select a male from that one that
could stand next to the C5 in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology speaking, also how it flowers
and you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I found that, I kept it around
and then I started to use it on the AG-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants that came from that,
I test drove them and they were amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that became the Isaac Hays that they
now offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's AG-13 crossed to C5, five Hays C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we did some work with the
Nevels Hays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the same male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one male I preserved for the
original dump train because I like these
[SPEAKER_00]: people very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a good, cozy coffee shop in the
heart of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are like the old traditional
Dutch bringing still the Hays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was, and I liked that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by this good understanding between
each other, I favored them to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they allowed me, they offered me a
platform to do some of my own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually nice to make these first
steps into like the more quote unquote
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing spectrum because well,
it's not really breathing I consider,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but I can vouch surely for that
there will be some fire in the seats,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they will be in the seat lines
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my work for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I say, okay, these long flower
and cultivars, well, hey, they take long
[SPEAKER_00]: to test and verify and you know,
like to really get into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it's good that they are made
available for the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will have them, you know,
the plants will speak for itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way I, and I like the C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to bring that more to the
foreground, like the Hays C spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good balance with the Hays A in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives it more, a little bit raciness,
but I still select towards the,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the terpenes coming from the C line
more than the A line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a personal preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, as I mentioned,
I love that C5 spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm on board with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just quickly clarify?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say that it was, you got a Hays
male from Shanty or was it an NL Hays?
[SPEAKER_00]: NL Hays, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an NL Hays from Shanty, the five Hays
C, which is then actually like a half
[SPEAKER_00]: sister, let's say of the C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, because he's not like five version
is a different one than the original one
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he crossed it to the Hays C and
that's why I thought it was interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: merge these two because in effect there
are two times NL five Hays C, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from that, it enabled me to,
you know, find a male that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: worthy and terpenes and, you know,
like leaned really to the, it's like more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less a C5, IBL male, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was then my, that was one I
was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I tested the progeny,
I could see also that I was satisfied
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, what came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this male became of interest to
see what they should drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the CC top line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a C5 close to this male
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all C then, you know, what you
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that sounds like a really cool
mixture of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually a homeo mine,
shout out to Eli Cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a really nice Isaac Hayes
cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Credit to the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of people are interested in
hearing because unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, very difficult to get samples of
these strains, but how would you describe
[SPEAKER_02]: the A5 and how would you describe the C5
for someone who's never been able to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: it or smell it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's the smell?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So C5, there's a lot of fruitiness also
piney.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, some, yeah, like a chemical
undertone under it when it's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also depends on how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in living soil, for instance,
it comes out as a very different thing
[SPEAKER_00]: than on hydro based salts, like we grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends, but it's more like to the
fruity side of it, you know, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpena, the lemony, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I could also refer like the mango
Hayes has a lot of this in it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the Hayes C is more like
the perfumy kind, the floral kind,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the A5 is more like the liver
scented, you know, like this more meaner
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of dark, sometimes a little bit
fermented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a very darker, but it's,
it's a very nice smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think A5 taste-wise it's really
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the effect I do not like so much.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like, it's like, it puts you,
it's just like, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a unique thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like its smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, that incense thick smoke you get
from a good well-grown A5, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably, you can also be very
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the A line is very well, it's a very
unique, special Hayes line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's being preserved and I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good that people can access it and
do their own work with it because that
[SPEAKER_00]: also enhances the gene pool in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these power plants, they really,
you know, yeah, they're changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we speak, don't underestimate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, it's for the niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a niche market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for everybody, but it's good that
power collapse and other genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so A opposed to C, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So C is more uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a little bit soaring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all NL5 Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what people sometimes say is that
they have this trash in the ant,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say from coming from the NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's true compared to 100% NLD
or some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some 100% NLD can be very soaring high,
very, whoa, you know, like it's a leap.
[SPEAKER_00]: A week above the Hayes hybrids still,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually they are not the best plants
to grow for like yield, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also take factor along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hybrids are like the middle ground,
let's say between the commercial and the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-commercial, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but they still contain that strong
Hayes influence, which we like so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so A5 is very introspective,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, yeah, it's better that you,
when you're not used to it and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna smoke a really well grown A5 joint
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, do it secluded somewhere like,
you know, you feel like these and at home
[SPEAKER_00]: and comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a psychedelic a little bit,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the C5 is more friendly and C is
more playful, but also not to be
[SPEAKER_00]: underestimated in sheer potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the novel smoker, let's say,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for the ones that really are aware of
what cannabis is and they can take it
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're used to cushions and cakes
and you smoke your first Hayes joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it can give you a little smack,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize, I don't know if I'd actually
asked you yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever had much experience with
just straight Hayes in the various
[SPEAKER_02]: incarnations it has?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I had the pleasure to,
you know, encounter people that hold,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, also special pure Hayes lines and
tap into those to really see what comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it and props to them because yeah,
they are really like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are like, but like I say,
usually they don't deliver so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like more, so it's like more for
personal usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people that are really into it,
like when you grow full Hayes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say they don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypical expressions might
produce really nice, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But compared to these hybrids,
from my experience, they are more finicky
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are also different leaky plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the high that it produces,
well, it's like an amazing thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more for really the passionado
that really wants to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: From these that truly embraces them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, of course, because I'm a
passionado myself, you get to know these
[SPEAKER_00]: people in your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you travel or you go,
we have a fair here in Barcelona each
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like I've been going there
for a lot of years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other fairs too,
like in Germany, Germany is looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize it too, or like regulate it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see a lot of good things happening in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you meet a lot of people and some
people, yeah, you know, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have also five, it's great,
you know, and they're usually not really
[SPEAKER_00]: the, they are like the biggest names in
the industry, or like have the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram page, you know, but they're
usually more like the other people that
[SPEAKER_00]: really have the passion for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, they, so we sit around
the table and exchange things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always a great thing,
okay, to meet like-minded and people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, especially the hashish
because I'm always looking for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's somewhere a passionado with a
good piece of really that good old
[SPEAKER_00]: authentic Lebanese, Turkish, or,
you know, like Nepal, the best case
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario of geopolitical there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tough, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people live under so tight regimes,
they cannot do what the smugglers also
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to reform the world so that
we can access this hashish again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a hundred percent ride or die for
the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people have been doing it for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, with modern technology that
we can provide them in the West.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was also what made the Nepalese
that I referred to earlier as the best
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke I ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made it so exclusive because there
were people there like Westerners there
[SPEAKER_00]: that were like helping assisting these
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: To produce an extra quality of hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to define it more pure with modern
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led to a spectacular synergy that
provided the best hash I was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: access for me personally in my personal
realm of reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not say that other people have maybe
also treasures in their pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, that was a pinnacle of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm sure that it's possible to make
it there, but yeah, you know, like now
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepal is not such a stable area,
sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say, yeah, we hope to change that
in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope and pray so we can access this
marvelous thing again.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's really something unique and
very, you know, it's a treasure of human
[SPEAKER_00]: kind also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to learn from it and respect
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, okay, small steps towards
the future, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully a giant leap soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all can get on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would all love to try some of that
Nepalese hash you describe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's a, it's going to be
worth the wait, but I just want to quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: loop back because the listeners will be
very upset if I don't ask, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: can we grab a quick description in the
same way you described the A5 and the C5
[SPEAKER_02]: of the hash plant haze, the Neville's haze
and the AG 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the AG 13 and the hash plant haze,
they're more like Afghani influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are really also two haze
expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the hash plant haze,
it has this remarkable hashy taste to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very stoned haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the stonest of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really like, it's a different
stone than for you could say that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned from A5 too, but it's like more
obliterating like, okay, but this one was
[SPEAKER_00]: really, it cracked you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghan was strong, let's say in the
hash plant haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it delivered like this giant calyxes
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a unique cultivar, very shining,
very abundant in resin also, but harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a little bit more, less power to
it that compared to the NL hazes in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of sensitivity, because when you grow it
right, it has power, but it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the AG 13 is also a very unique
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a musky kind of type haze
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's the best haze A hybrid in the
spectrum of these old cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least what I consider to be the best
haze A crossing was AG 13, because the G13
[SPEAKER_00]: gives more like a relaxed tone to all this
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, okay, especially coming from
the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it dampens it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, it's like a really
good combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more medicinal, I think also,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an ideal smoke to have when
you're like not feeling good and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, first do something
initially, it gives you this flash,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then it goes, it's more relaxing,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more kind to compare to A5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a better balanced haze
hybrid in all sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that the most from the A side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the hush plant haze,
like I said, okay, it's a very finicky
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's not really popular on the
agenda for most cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all kind of like, it's also what the
market demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market usually demands A5 and
Nettles haze, because that's the two most
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the C5 and then the hush plant
haze, there's not so much demand for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has to be grown to full
potential to really be appreciated for
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of growers, excuse me,
that attempt to grow it and fail a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of times, well, they don't want to grow it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would rather go to the A lines,
AG13, Nettles haze, A5, because in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, well, it needs different parameters
to get to full potential than the C lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're a little bit more
practical, I think, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have other complications,
let's say, but so they are also more rock
[SPEAKER_00]: solid in bud formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the C line tends to go a little
bit more open flowery when you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated to full potential, and in the
worst case, it turns to hay, like I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that happens to a cultivator paying
in like four or five months, also putting
[SPEAKER_00]: in the African cost and nothing comes in
return because it's a haystack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not going to grow it again,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have to be really good motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the A hybrids, they have more appeal
also for the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they like the flash and bang,
so to speak, that obliterating feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to really delve into the finance of
haze, I think the C side is more but over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years, it got more hybridized with
shorter flowering varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so actually they bred away from the
haze instead of enhancing it more in Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: thermology then, because it was more
practical to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to flower time from going 14
weeks to let's say 11 weeks, 10 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still with haze hanging to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, you start selecting for
that and for commercial purposes more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we kind of dig it so much and we
also know how to grow it that we keep
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants to ourselves and cultivate
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are like a little bit the last of
the Mohicans, I think, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it shines back again, like I say,
okay, because this is a solid value in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community, these hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they will be forever there
because when you grow it to full
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, well, you can throw it on the
table and no matter what anybody carries,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will say like, wait, this is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way how you connect also with
people in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a crazy dive over the years with
my beautiful cultivars and the people I
[SPEAKER_00]: have met by then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the midst of that epic answer,
I heard you mentioned that the Neville's
[SPEAKER_02]: haze is one of the more potent ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us just a quick overview of
the smell and the effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that it's one you really
don't see a lot in the modern scene and so
[SPEAKER_02]: people find it very elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it depends on also the set and
setting with these smokes, so when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: in a comfortable set and setting,
it can be very pleasant initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, okay, the soaring high,
you really connect and you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: something and you're like completely in
the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you then have to go to pick some
groceries in the shop and you step
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, you're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this, because then it hits you how
high you actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can produce some anxiety with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this when you're used to smoking
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found it very, so it does something
to your mind frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's an awareness and this plant,
so it tampers with your awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like getting high, there's so many
varieties in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these special varieties, well,
they're unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the Neville's haze and the
haze eight lines, they are very dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice to indulge in for a little
while, but then you lose it a little bit,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you live too much in your own
world or something, because it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a daily job and you talk this
week on a daily basis, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you step into this different
realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an artist and you can produce
art, it's maybe nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have to work as an IT agent
and you have to put your mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's of course a passion and it
became my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have a little bit of this
passion also to appreciate it and to live
[SPEAKER_00]: it like we do, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would not advocate it to smoke it
daily when you're not ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to really want it in your life
and love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise it can do alluring things with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still does for me once in a while
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love the Band-Aid number
seven so much, because it has the depth
[SPEAKER_00]: and vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes all the boxes, but so it has a
more friendly high to it, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's less exhaustive also, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very dreamy like mushroom wheat,
but in the best way possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And A5 and Neville's haze, they aren't
kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each plant has this temperament,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the temperament of the Neville's
haze and the A5, well, not so much,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my lady to go dancing with
every night because she's ruthless,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: She throws me around like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd rather have like a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice for the joint and it gets high
and a few hours later it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, A5 lingers too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put you a little bit in this
uneasy field and the Neville haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it fucks you up in your mind,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's also the thing is I think
with these more psychedelic or like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, so they're more spiritual embedded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they increase your awareness of
things, which is not always easy because,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we live in a brutal society,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're motherfucking high all
the time and I look at what the human
[SPEAKER_00]: concept is and what we make of it,
well, it's sometimes mind-boggling,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe smoke the joint and get high because
then it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, when you sit around the table
with a lot of people comfortable and you
[SPEAKER_00]: share a joint like that or at the campfire
or the festival or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in these best case scenarios, it really
can, you know, enhance your experience so
[SPEAKER_00]: much, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I once went to Mexico and I saw the
Palenque ruins there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I went there, I was sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next day I encountered somebody
and I could smoke some haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went back again and believe me,
all right, Mexicans, I don't know what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was, but it was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was like a totally different
experience as the day before, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the weed I kind of like,
you know, this weed that has this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more a spiritual thing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's like really makes you pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indulging in it, in our society,
well, it's not the most easy thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can certainly appreciate the sentiment
and we'll definitely get to the healing
[SPEAKER_02]: bandaid haze very shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to ask you one last quick
question in regards to these cuts and more
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, Neville, did you ever have
any interaction with Neville?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on him?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you regard him as the greatest of
all time in terms of breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, Neville, his influence is in
dispute at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This man created some things that are
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, like, so it's like this
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville created the hybrids and with
that actually paved the way of modern
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are the whole cannabis industry and
community, all this man, a great deal of,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you know, like, it's like,
yeah, of course he is what he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but that also counts, for instance,
for someone who was bringing the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also then when you go past that,
the Hays brothers, whoever they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe even the beatnik generation that
were initially in getting high,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it's all a little bit
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see also Hays originated in Santa Cruz,
California, as far as historians go,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we follow the historical path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it came to Holland and Neville
got in touch with it and made something
[SPEAKER_00]: really remarkable for it because he has a
nose for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his breathing work is like,
it speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still live in this legacy for,
and we must be thankful for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we were lucky to safeguard
the part of this man's legacy and that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard, okay, by being preserved,
by loving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I never really understood
who Neville was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was later by So we held the clones,
let's say from these people got into
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble and we took the matters up and to
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like 1999, the millennium change,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we went underground with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I lost the A5 and I wanted to find it
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so internet then came and it
revolutionized the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all agree on that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was going online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm searching for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brought me then to the M&S board
because there were similar genetics being
[SPEAKER_00]: made available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, Hey man, this is maybe a way
of retrieving the A5 back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was a member on the boards and
then Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was reading about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by being on an international board,
you could start understanding more about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a mirror that was placed in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, realizing now,
so we were never really affiliated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Amsterdam scene back when I met these
group that were holding the hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, we went there for like to see
the city and do some coffee shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we never went there to really as a
cannabis enthusiast, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, that came later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us then, so we didn't have to
drive two or three hours because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: available like around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we held it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by being on the boards then I could
really beginning to understand like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, we have something special here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew they were for Neville, but I never
really paid attention how this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community before the bigger scheme then
was at play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just my secluded grower and
preserving, preservation of these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: safeguarding them by loving them so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get this feedback of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later through MNS, I got indeed
in brief interaction with Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the whole thing exploded there
and yeah, well, so it became like
[SPEAKER_00]: something I'd rather steer away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I just love these plants and
yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville made his soul rest in peace and
we owe this man a really great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he did something remarkable,
but you know, he did it in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, so it's more like,
so the people that are not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spotlight also usually for preserving
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we owe them like really a ton of
gratitude because Neville was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, but he was not a preservationist.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's usually breeders are not the
best preservationist for one reason or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to also with illegal
legislations, not being able to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant potentials clean or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can diverge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have so many reasons.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I never intended to breed with
these plants until I could assess for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself how unique they were in the
cannabis genome.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you start paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never wanted to exploit them for any
benefit, surely for my own, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been part of our lives for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by being there on the boards and
realizing what you have, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some people ask me like,
Oh, I really would love to smoke this A5
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, like, so then we interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I gave it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I love these people also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, of course it gets
shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really great thing,
because that's where they belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also why we kept them around
for so many years.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only to, yeah, first and foremost,
be able to access ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the best case scenario,
that's what smokers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get high together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you want it,
and I really, you know, we share breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an awesome sentiment and an
interesting observation as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you made about breeders and not being able
to preserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've certainly lost the plant here and
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to acknowledge it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to ask you, what's the,
what's the backstory on the Miracle Tie
[SPEAKER_02]: that ended up creating the Band-Aid haze?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me how that one went down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good question actually,
because in the end, nobody knows what this
[SPEAKER_00]: medical tie supposedly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually, it became a miracle
because there was a coffee shop in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area that was called Miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these people that were providing A5
flowers, they had a crop there and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something pollinated a crop and there
were some seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these were kept around for long by
the people there that weren't the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually also safeguarded the A5 crop
for long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this area, it got lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these seeds were sent to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: where they resulted in this male that then
eventually produced the Band-Aid number
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and it speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thankfully we made some seeds with that
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have it now in our vaults ready to,
like I say, when the legislation change
[SPEAKER_00]: while these seeds and these genetics were
made available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank God we have enough of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the A5 crossed to the A5 tie,
which are nice lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are preserving what we can,
whether it's in plant form or seed form to
[SPEAKER_00]: once, you know, tap into this genome more
deeper, let's say, and see what comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Band-Aid seven, it's just an
example of what to find in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a unique, beautiful cultivar,
but also not easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also like this when people are
used to growing like haze hybrids that go
[SPEAKER_00]: like 12 weeks and they used to chop it
around, let's say the 90 day market or
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then while the Band-Aid starts then
producing beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to give it time because it
goes like to 15 weeks up to 15 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then you might go to 60 weeks if
you really want to grow it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then she is like, wow, she blows.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really can stand next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that only shows the potential of
these genetics towards the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm thankful to be privileged to be
working these exclusive genetics in that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also see how the breeding
potential, how high it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I say, most commercial growers
don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have streamlined facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are like doing a thousand
indoor lights and you put a cultivar like
[SPEAKER_00]: that in it and it goes around,
well, you are 20 weeks further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it's a big problem, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been fortunate enough to try the
Band-Aid seven myself, but the thing I was
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to ask you was obviously it was
Miracle Tie onto that A5 and then Bodie
[SPEAKER_02]: cross it to the Cuban Black Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cuban Black Haze, that's suspected of
being like a very A5, like it is very A5
[SPEAKER_02]: leaning from what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the A5 itself is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting that the Band-Aid
Haze, like, would you say the effect is
[SPEAKER_02]: like the A5 or not really?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much better the effect, you know,
like, so it has the deepness of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze A side to it, but it doesn't fuck
with your mindset so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so negative the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much more positive and bright,
inspiring and creative instead of more
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of overthinking things like,
you know, like, like, get fixated that
[SPEAKER_00]: some things are like, it's hard to
describe how it works actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's much more friendly and it has
this A5 progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you say, it's actually, you know,
so A5 cross to question mark this male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would be nice to, with our
modern technology, like to lab test it
[SPEAKER_00]: further to see in the future, which
actually is close related to whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: male was that pollinated this A5 because
when you look at the B7, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's on the Cuban Black Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you said, now I haven't grown the Cuban
Black Haze itself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there are many Cuban Black
Haze's going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to distinguish actually which
one will be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that, so I cannot confirm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so it's probably also, from what I've
heard, the best assumption that I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make from my limited abilities to assess
it, let's say, it's probably a Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze that was shipped back then in the
early 90s or maybe late 80s when these
[SPEAKER_00]: tester seeds were available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe back then, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the morphology of this Cuban Black
Haze, well, it's more comparable to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's Haze we have here than it is to
A5 or C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a different structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see, when I see pictures of this
cultivar of the Cuban Black Haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see more like this type of structure,
morphology structure as I can see it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Neville's Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has more like, it's very,
but it's stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more stouty compared to the Hazes
we have, but it's branching is more like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also not flowering so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's only 12 weeks or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the best assumption I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the case, then it's actually A5
cross to Haze C cross to A5 cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: question mark.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, it's like a really good
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's only sad that only the
Band-Aid Haze got selected because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: in the seed like could be more,
but it's a unique cultivar and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: a keeper plant this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have tested many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't come across any keepers like I
tested many Hazes, other Hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Amnesia Haze was also nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it didn't really appeal to me in
high and overall plants compared to A5 or
[SPEAKER_00]: C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Super Silver Haze not so much like I
say, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mango Haze in terms of morphology also
not, but I liked its smokability a lot.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like this, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Band-Aid Haze really sticks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever the male was that hit the A5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it makes a really good plant,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all seeds also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they tried out the male,
but they only had success to find one male
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sadly it got lost.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also then we come again,
preserving, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A male like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was for Neville also back in the
day, Haze A also got lost very early
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there was only Haze C left which
made the A5.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hybrids more like mesmerizing or like
legendary because there are only few of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Haze C then later got, it was around
so much later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was then usable to create other
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I say, usually they steered away
a little bit from the Haze side,
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercial side of the spectrum then
because the impracticalities to cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: it to full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had two more stream-like plants
because it's more easy to cultivate,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hybridization further came and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene pool got a little bit diluted in
the Haze C thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have it in pure form still,
well, it has a sheer power and it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly, like I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, the Band-Aid Haze,
the Cuban Black Haze, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: also leaning more to the Haze A side,
definitely in scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the privilege to go to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a chance to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I was able to sample some of this
Cuban Black Haze and it's clearly related
[SPEAKER_00]: to the A line, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has the same kind of more machine
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it's not that liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find liver in it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it has a dark and rotten
fermented thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see the relation between the
Cuban Black Haze and Neville's work
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely related 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you then think that this Cuban
Black Haze with this A5 cultivar produced
[SPEAKER_00]: such a nice cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In morphology, I can understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in smokability, it was a surprise
because it doesn't have this negative,
[SPEAKER_00]: so possible negative sphere that usually
comes from Haze A hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's more to the C side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think the Cuban Black Haze
might be Neville's Haze, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some C in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this question mark pollinating the A5
might also have a play in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should also look into lab testing it to
find out maybe, okay, where it fits into
[SPEAKER_00]: like...
[SPEAKER_00]: But this science is also emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can now test genomes and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like this library is still a little
bit debatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like not really clear yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to investigate further to see
the correlation between things.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can establish to say, oh,
it's possibly this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't personally think it's a tie that
pollinated this A5, but who's to know?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it produced the black band-aid
Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, totally speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you said, it'll be awesome one day
if we are able to test these things and
[SPEAKER_02]: get an answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions we had submitted by a
few different listeners is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Duby of AC, it's a good friend of the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to hear a little bit about your
collaboration with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of your thoughts on the
crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have maybe a favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, Duby had an interesting
library, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: In potential plans to make these clones
also more available to the wide stream
[SPEAKER_00]: audience in a way I saw more fitting the
heirlooms itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, usually they've been
bred away from the Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's more NLD rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: The library sparkled my enthusiasm to
contact him and to say, hey man,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you have nice parental.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some special heirlooms,
you know, but you think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can maybe, you know, enhance the gene
pool with that and make this weed
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because over the years, a lot of people
ask me to please send me the A5,
[SPEAKER_00]: please send me the C5 and I can understand
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I would be mailing like a
hundred clones every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have shared it with some people that
I consider being part of my intimate
[SPEAKER_00]: sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, this usually that these
plants are exchanged also, and they become
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and then you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course it spreads out,
but that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so it is, I had like, so his
credentials were nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we experimented and got together and we
are still working on like, so it's an R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we chose the Malawi because he's in
favor of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did some work previously myself with
Malawi that actually brought me to Aseeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had a mutual passion,
let's say, he was working with this Aseeds
[SPEAKER_00]: line and he had pollen from an exceptional
male he found in the Malawi line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he exchanged pollen with me and I
did my own little work and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey man, the progeny is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I see like something I am
looking for and like, what was the progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: then of the Aseeds matings?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's by going to Spanabes,
Luis is also based in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, our worlds, you know, connected
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then decided to look into it and do
some breeding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like the Super Malawi Haze or
like the, yeah, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Malawi Haze, I think it's another
haze across to the Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like I said, they are long
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has now also released some with
Oaxaca and with Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I smoked some because we also have
a collective here of people that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like pop some seeds to see
what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I liked with the Panama,
the A5 Panama liked really nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are some people growing it
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes longer to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are waiting for actually the
people's preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there will be a few lines that
Aseed can use to enhance his own library.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he does fabulous work with his
own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a good guy and he knows a lot
about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that regard, I found it very
interesting also to mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people begged me for a file
and no one came.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, okay, let's make it
accessible for people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a way, I think it's a good way not
to do another Super Silver Haze story or
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, Jack Heron or whatever,
you know, or also not with kushes because
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the kush takes a lot too much away
from haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, morphology wise, they can produce
really extraordinary plants, but you get
[SPEAKER_00]: these kuster pins in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also downgrade this haze too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too overpowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd rather have than a natural black
limit like Thai or like natural varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: land races that are also being refined by
a breeder work like Aseed is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then bring these two wells together
to, you know, allow people to have like an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what it is to smoke an A5 because
you have phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of gratitude from people also
to make it available in this kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are all based in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also fighting for better
legislations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are assisting each other also
to, you know, enhance our capabilities to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, make the broader awareness here
that it's a good business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a normal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be considered as winemaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like this tolerated more or
less wave that has hit Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need better legislations and then we
can do proper work, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think Aseed is one of the more
professional here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has some interesting genetics and
therefore I wanted to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say tap into, I personally
like sea lines a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so usually the people go for the A5
cross to whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they all want this A5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I recommend people to tap into the sea
line too, because yeah, the sea has
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know, like, so people that
want to smoke daily, the sea line,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only recommend people also to
look into that because it's worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an awesome answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've sussed the list out myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of mouthwatering options on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reckon that will be killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to ask you, you know,
cause Aseed offers and works with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you, have you been tracking or got
any thoughts on some of the newer land
[SPEAKER_02]: race genetics that have been coming in by
way of places like Indian land race
[SPEAKER_02]: exchange and some of these other cool cats
in the community?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these other guys in the community
who are out there collecting land race
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics and offering them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, you know, it depends also what
your personal preference is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So land races, well, so a land race is
usually not the most suitable cultivar to
[SPEAKER_00]: place in an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have to be exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say it's not possible,
but you give and take the fact that if a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is produced, for instance,
in India for like number of years and you
[SPEAKER_00]: tap into a sea line here, well,
it's a very different cultivar than let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say any other cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a personal preference test.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, ganja is ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want to smoke Indian varieties,
I smoke their hash preferably.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not really looking at that,
but some land races of course are
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ganja, the ganja countries,
they have different land races than the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the Thai varieties or
like their regions that these,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like Southeast Asia, more generally
speaking, okay, they smoke the ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so like from areas where hash is
produced, well, these cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're hash cultivars.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're totally different to place them
in an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not what I would aim for or
look for, you know, but ganja varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: land race varieties, they are really
interesting to enhance the gene pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ganja gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't necessarily say it's bad to
have a Tibetan variety in your gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they could be nice surprising in
terms of getting high maybe, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not really made for the realm of people
that produce wheat, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for the big market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also a very niche market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will delve into it for personal
preferences, but not necessarily because
[SPEAKER_00]: they are the most yielding and rewarding
plants all around speaking, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about personal preference,
which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only like applaud these people for
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me personally, it's not my field
of interest in merging realms of ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other because hash cultivars,
well, like I said, they are usually hash
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that speak for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the hash plant is a very good
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can work, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to throw a lot of numbers of
seeds to be able to do proper selection in
[SPEAKER_00]: that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it's not a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for people that are working in
business, large scale, yes, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might find that one exceptional
parental that can enhance the gene pool in
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the beauty about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm working these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't like uniforming them so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference must be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be a good blend, so to speak,
or a good hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you keep also the pedigree clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody knows what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think the majority of the market
is like the nine week cultivation wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have like the finer blends to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can go up to like maybe 20 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really a niche market,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really something that will be
grown in big facilities, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't have the market for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard to imagine popping
some land race seeds and getting something
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market would be accepting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did, you know, pique my curiosity when
you're answering that last question is
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of slightly unrelated, but mostly
related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tried to make hash out of
any of the, you know, the heirlooms you
[SPEAKER_02]: hold, or do you feel like the magic is
within the flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no, no, we did, you know,
but it really works best from outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you light up it here in
summertime, and we were fortunate to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you dry sift under the best
possible conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditional also, well, I must say the
80 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that's the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sadly here over now, we don't,
we don't can access the harsh plant haze
[SPEAKER_00]: temporarily due to also the legislation
and that's unfriendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to regain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit tricky, but that
would also be a very good cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, to do that, you know,
when you light up it on the sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, outdoors, man, yes, the hash
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's a one phenotype hashish,
so to speak.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was, yeah, it absolutely was blow
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much better than the other other
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosen is also, of course, a very nice way
to tap into the thing, but you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have this machine and it's very sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of liked the dry sift methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, like you, you press it
and you have like, yeah, but we like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To, to have this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really blows your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, people are a little bit afraid of
it, especially those from metal haze and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a five, you know, like, seriously,
it's like, oh, you don't want to give it
[SPEAKER_00]: to somebody that don't know what it's
because that stuff is brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, so the type of hashies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that comes more, more close to really
the type of Afghan psychedelic hashies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the 80 13 absolutely was the winner
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, yeah, we do make cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do B a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my favorite is that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you have to grow outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's here with this legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, because it's in the iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very complicated to get it
done, but once it's done, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's absolutely, uh, yeah, something
unique or so.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can only imagine that sounds like it
would be a real treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our listeners wanted to ask,
are your flowers like sort of your cruise
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers sort of consistently available at
Dram King?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were to go visit Amsterdam,
or is it like a hot commodity and you got
[SPEAKER_02]: to sort of be, you know, they're at the
right moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's actually the case because you
know, I'm not, I'm a secluded man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot do big things.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only recommend the people to ask
the bartenders, like, uh, if they have
[SPEAKER_00]: some Sammy grown there because it's there,
you know, it's also like, it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, so it's hard to, to, to be,
to be delivering that consistency in that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of league, because while I'm not in
this commercial mainframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, and also it takes a lot of time,
man, along with these long flowerings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's some batches,
of course, that he, uh, that they,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, save, but you know, it's a hard thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's really good, like I told
you, it's like quickly sold also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it takes a little time to,
uh, to fill the tank again, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, yeah, we do the best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend people going there to like
request the tenders there, if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: anything available and I'm sure they will,
uh, assist you accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I do the best I can with the means I
have, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it is for now, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, look, I don't think anyone blames you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's understandable with all the
parameters you mentioned and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of ties into another question we had
from, uh, another listener, which was,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you feel about the new legal system
in Holland?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is it so hard to find drill haze
in Amsterdam anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because nobody wants to grow it then
it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the types of the, of the modern
strains, like the cushions and the cakes
[SPEAKER_00]: are like the more Cali strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so they are also a hype here and
everybody jumps on it because it's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, of course it makes more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it's actually crazy in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cushions like the Cali strains are
often the retail for like 35 plus euros a
[SPEAKER_00]: gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mine is like 16 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind about that because I think,
you know, it's all about an honest smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying they're like nine
weeks easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, yeah, but so the markets is
completely upside down, but it is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, yeah, what can I say about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a haze was, there was a time in the
nineties when the cultivation was less
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted and it was still more open that
the hazes were also more frequently grown
[SPEAKER_00]: by the passionates and you had more home
growers, let's say.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they started to target really the
home cultivators, well, it moved a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit to more like, uh, yeah, the criminals
fear that they pushed it in that because
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you know, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they incriminate the cultivation more
while they still enhance the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop being read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a complete absurdity,
but anyway, that was the sad evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was also the reason why
secluded grows like myself went deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: under.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, yeah, has also to have to
face the consequences, but in the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: do it with passion and with heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it got a little bit pushed away by
the, uh, transformation of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the, so legalization in America and
Canada, or like regularization or like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I never expected in the
nineties, if somebody would have told me
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's going to be legal or like,
you know, regulated America prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, so you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we were expecting legalization
within five years and then it became 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, 15, 20, 25, 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the haze got a little bit pushed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it's kind of reside only in
the people that kind of treasured it
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody was growing amnesia
suddenly here because it was a sturdy
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, easy to grow nine weaker variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you know, you had different types of
amnesia, but the one that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, it's the, I think the hydro cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so you grow it in nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they chop it with a little early
or 10, maybe tops and it yields a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's potent wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it's not really, it doesn't hold
any, uh, like the sacred thing is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit breathed away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to maintain that, but yeah,
we are like the last of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says you're totally insane.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, insane or not, we do it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, you know, you're referring to
like the sacredness of the haze high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess, you know, a common breeding
strategy we see being embraced more often
[SPEAKER_02]: is old school versus new school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess what's your thoughts on the
idea of like a C5 cross to gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you think there's any value in
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's just too dominant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's too dominant in the,
so for my personal preference,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say that it will not produce
really stellar plants and be maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: margin of two worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing the haze to the cushions,
but you know, so it's like different to
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different two worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like also back in the day,
the people, the initiators of the
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation, they weren't so fond of
skunk line because that was over dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: in every kind of society almost you found
on the Dutch market back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wanted to keep the haze as good as
possible around and not intermix it with
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say, I also grow the old school
haze and it's a great mix of skunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, it has potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for my personal preference,
I wouldn't go for it because I personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like all cannabis, but I'm not so in
favor of certain cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my also limited accessibility also
to trying them and to properly evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't say there are cushions maybe
in the field that I do like smoke ability
[SPEAKER_00]: wise and also morphology wise,
you know, so that, but it's not something
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for because usually our
cushions are short flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you will have an offspring that
will diminish also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take away from the haze
experience, so to speak, in ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that's the case and produce a less
or more sedative kind of stone in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my experience with cushions anyway,
but so they're more like sedative kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be good and also a little bit
more relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are a little bit
overpowering, like couch locking,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not my type of weed that I would
access if I have a variety on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my preferences was not so we tried
it ourselves and I didn't like it so much
[SPEAKER_00]: the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant wise, wow, really amazing plants
came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought the flowers were too,
so it steered away from the haze too much
[SPEAKER_00]: for my personal taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't really go into that myself,
but if people like bushes and they also
[SPEAKER_00]: like hazes, yeah, man, I would say go for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're sort of circling around the
idea of this topic of like, how do we get
[SPEAKER_02]: more people interested in these older
varieties?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the sort of ideas that pops up
is that some of these older heirlooms and
[SPEAKER_02]: just really special strains in general
don't necessarily test that high in THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like a lot of the general
consumers of the market are largely driven
[SPEAKER_02]: by those values.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is the way in which we
might be able to get more people aware of
[SPEAKER_02]: the special effects and nature of these
older plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a synergy between compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So numbers do play into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, haze also is like around,
let's say 20% THC, but now you have
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of 30% THC that produce a
totally different high than coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: these hazes and they're not so psychedelic
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the synergy between all compounds,
not only THC, but also like flavonoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: like terpenoids, that is like give this
weed its character or its potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole book, let's say, if you just
like read one page of this book,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you can extrapolate it and look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's much more to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it works on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to only focus on THC, although it
has its relevance in making us high,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like not something that will produce
necessarily a better high or like a better
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little bit with alcohol,
it's also like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this sort of kind of varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 80% full alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we don't drink that in pure form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must be crazy for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you dilute it with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a strain like, yeah,
sometimes they make extracts of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, pure THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you dab that, well, yeah, well,
it's not really, so it's a cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very mono, so it's very mono,
it's not, so it's very, yeah, monoistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I'm not for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, like a painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the whole painting, not just a
fragment of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to only focus on numbers,
that would be, it's like you read every
[SPEAKER_00]: note from a symphony, but you don't hear
the music of the symphony.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the people that are focused
on numbers to enhance their own profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a little bit obsessed with
numbers too much, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they should smoke a good joint and
reevaluate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in a similar vein, I'd love to ask
you, let's say someone's listening to this
[SPEAKER_02]: episode and they're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try some of these cool
heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of genetics would you advise
someone to get if they had to use seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and they want to get their toes wet in
this sort of effect and plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the seed that we are making
available at all is a little dumpling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, what I do with AC,
it's also, I would say also go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some people in the business
here in Holland that are working also with
[SPEAKER_00]: these hybrids and producing their own
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, it just, the internet
is full of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you type in a certain seed banks are
offering them now, and it's only like the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, I think, because there will be
more offerings and more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be done in the coming future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for now, I would say like the AC
lines are very nice with the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collaborated on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the bars are full of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Wally, for instance, also makes
like nice things available for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are some people also that
are working to when the legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: changes step further out of the closet and
make their own kind of NLD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum or bring their own kind of NLD
spectrum to the market, which are,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are working already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice to see people collaborating
with passion around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sharing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you bring worlds
together and you can really make extra
[SPEAKER_00]: ordinary plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you combine elite plants with each
other, yeah, of course, the result will be
[SPEAKER_00]: something elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the good synergy between two
plants, because not necessarily two
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids that are really stellar,
you know, can enhance in its progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to really test it and know
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of passionados in the world are
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think once the legislation in
multiple countries will change,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it will change also the
accessibility of the more haze dominated
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of cannabis, let's say,
or NLD for that matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that definitely happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you one last question
before we jump into our final five.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fan submitted one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, can you ask Sammy,
what's his thoughts on the early pearl
[SPEAKER_02]: slash silver pearl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's like every plant has
its unique kind of morphology and
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was never really fond of it because
the labs, it lacked vigor to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we kind of embraced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although it's nice to have it around
and to be able to have grows here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: local communities that are still,
you know, also busy with these other old
[SPEAKER_00]: head rooms that they are keeping and try
to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, these kind of, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like every kind of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, but cultivation wise,
I never really went in these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums because we have the haze head
rooms and we have our hands full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of, you know, enriched me,
but also limited me in tapping into
[SPEAKER_00]: certain seed lines myself and better
evaluate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my take on it is like, I don't know,
like original normal light, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I never accessed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now it appears to have re-emerged
or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this is all true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just speculating, but I have to grow
it to know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I never had a chance to grow this
particular cultivar he's mentioning or tap
[SPEAKER_00]: into the seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot really assess it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some people who grow it,
but so it's like a different league.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has his own kind of niche work
here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we stick to our own, let's say,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are the haze people and other
people while they do other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had it myself, so I really
can't comment too much, but it's certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: one people are always very, very curious
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, brings us to our final five.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question I want to ask you was
what's the single most memorable or
[SPEAKER_02]: impactful memory you have with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't have to necessarily be like the
most potent cannabis, but just an event
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was incredibly memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had the number of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether to the good positive side or to
the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it enhances your experience,
I think.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the best kind of moments while you
are, you know, it makes everything more
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you feel like, yeah,
it's a divide feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think it's a very spiritual
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was, I had the fortunate to do some
travelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I say, okay, sometimes cannabis
can really enhance your awareness of being
[SPEAKER_00]: there and feeling the environment tap into
it, you know, like be in the moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, and it can also take away
a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you're totally
obliterated, you know, I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: so when I, for instance, I'm, when I met
these people, so it was before GPS and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sometimes I drove back from
them and I lost the way because I was so
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucking high ending up in the,
like in the mid zone of Holland when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: having to the south, like not really
realizing it suddenly like, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the best way possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, so I was high on the IQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, okay, since I was 18 years old,
I kind of indulged in the cannabis sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, yeah, it's enhanced my
life completely as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the good or for sometimes the
challenging one, because it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: confrontational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, okay, it's not also an easy
legacy to carry when you're working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stigmas, like you're a criminal or
something where you're really actually
[SPEAKER_00]: loving something and you know what it's
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you make people high from it,
that's also something I like very much
[SPEAKER_00]: about being able to treasure something
that's really valuable and being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: share it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that access my flowers and
sometimes my work, they are really
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I had fortunate and the
pleasure also that people took their time
[SPEAKER_00]: and effort in coming to visit me here.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people you meet on the boards and
then they come here and there's a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, you know, like there's all
the gratitude you get from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have something that really,
you know, have an effect on people's
[SPEAKER_00]: emotional and mental awareness for the
good, you know, it's like a very thankful
[SPEAKER_00]: and humbling thing also to be part of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we do it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the getting high and gathering with
people, the deeper connections you make
[SPEAKER_00]: now also more abroad and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: People coming together, I think,
you know, this like-minded vibe that you
[SPEAKER_00]: share it's really great and mesmerizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one big good thing also,
also medicinal and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, this plant is the healing of the
nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I guess a lot of people
don't want to hear it or see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should drink a little bit less
and smoke a little bit more, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: I digress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next one is what's one situation
where you've been really excited to try
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been hyped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's telling you it's great,
a strain, and then you finally get to try
[SPEAKER_02]: it and you're not really impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like 99% of everything actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be privileged to having to compare
it with like elite cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying, so the Max Tisa,
that was a variety I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got also sent to by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in high, but I sadly lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but Max Tisa was one that stood out
for me over the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the Band-Aid 7, I said it,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I tried many.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, there were many good ones,
but keepers really only, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to, it's also because I work on
this legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot keep everything because I
would love to, but so it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking, I'm thinking,
you know, I had some really, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things also that blew my
motherfucking mind, I went to Spain a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this dab thing came up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I met a Canadian there and he said
I'd also did dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took nine dabs, you know,
in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that obliterated me kind of,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm aware of what dabbing is,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to rephrase on the first,
on the former question actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, what can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: About these hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you've, you answered it earlier
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good answer for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next question I've got for you is I'm
going to drop you on a desert Island and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can take three strains with you for
the rest of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be the clones or a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want, what three things are you
going to take with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, fuck man, things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's difficult one to an Island,
cannabis related things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's include it to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course this Nepalese hash it
cannot, you know, if it's ever accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I would like that to have like a
stash full of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it lasts a lifetime, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course with ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, if I would choose, I would go
for C5 because he's the queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to, you know, like also C5
was the most accessible for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us before we could retrieve the other
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had C5 and harsh plant taste for a
number of years here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's how I learned to grow it to
finance like say, because you only
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't access any other things,
but this completely aside, we had then
[SPEAKER_00]: this best C5, but you know, when you have
only one thing to smoke, no matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: good it is, you don't have any point of
relative to, you know, like to compare it
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you get bored with it
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will break the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need like more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go to the, you know, otherwise it will
be seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather stay here then I'm not going to
that island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll accept it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first answer of that nature
I've heard and we'll allow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
you're going to drop someone else off on
[SPEAKER_02]: the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone you're not super fond of.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've, they've dirtied the jeans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What three things are you going to leave
them with on the island?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they should really educate
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, you know, I could drop them with an
educational thing about this whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and you make them read and then they can
go back from that island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like put in the necessary work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that difficult and complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, first they need to acknowledge
it and take it for a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise I wouldn't, you know,
say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it's just like a call out that I make
because, you know, as a home grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: in essence, imagine you paying like 80 or
a hundred bucks or whatever to buy some
[SPEAKER_00]: seats and you get them and they are
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine you have like a few keepers
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not aware of it and it ruins your
whole library.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these people, it is a disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe pay attention and see really
if the potentials are not infected and if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, like do put in the
necessary to not spread this because for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of growers, well, it's a nuisance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a sad thing because,
yeah, you put in the effort and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: plant like deteriorate, it's on you and
you have no awareness from what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people that are aware in this
business should be aware and take
[SPEAKER_00]: precautions so that it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the notion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're changing the words, not the vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the final question is I've got a time
machine for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back anywhere, anytime to get
seeds, clones, whatever you want,
[SPEAKER_02]: where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In retrospect, knowing what we know now,
you know, the heritage of what Neville did
[SPEAKER_00]: there was very important.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think these seeds, so it's all like,
I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot verify any story yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so imagine the seed that he had back
then, if you would have the technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: like to sprout them all and not just get
like, five or six viable plants out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, like maybe a hundred
or a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that would be a world of change
and difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to kind of, you know,
like, I don't know, it's all originated
[SPEAKER_00]: also somewhere in various places on the
world and has brought together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, I think in the sixties,
what happened there was kind of really
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutionary also in spreading awareness
around the Western world about being more
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerated towards this plant, you know,
with the beatnik generation starting it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the hippie momentum and
everything that resided from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, over time we, this plant came,
so it was contraband, it became contraband
[SPEAKER_00]: in the thirties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know why it was for after the,
when they banned alcohol and so they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed another scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a racist story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a very sad story.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this plant became demonized,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that it's back kind of in our
spheres, we can normalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it becomes another
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what seeds I would say, the sixties
were crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really these Hayes brothers,
whoever they were, well, their seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would kind of like to access them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that whoever they were in the
sixties throughout the seventies,
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to access them in pure form,
but like in large numbers and do like what
[SPEAKER_00]: broad selection out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be like, yeah,
it's a dream for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Hayes brother seeds I want to delve
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be like late sixties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there'd be some gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're no doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any comments or shout outs you
want to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends here locally and
especially also a tribute to my ex-wife
[SPEAKER_00]: because we were locked down together and
she is still my partner in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, so the good people I interacted
with over time, you know, I built some
[SPEAKER_00]: really good connections that I'm really
happy with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can only hope that we all do our
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of change the legislation that are
still needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can then build our way to have an
enhanced gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can all have our personal preference
of cannabis available in our own seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stash and grow it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're aiming for and working
for every and any day in our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To liberate this plant and to have a
widespread genetically availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do our thing with the hazes and
with the NLD varieties and we will hope to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody that assists me and the
community around me of these beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say thank you for everything and
let's continue our voyage together.
