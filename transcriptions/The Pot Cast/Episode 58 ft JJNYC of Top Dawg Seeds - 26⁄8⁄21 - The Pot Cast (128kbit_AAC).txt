[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us today
Thank you for having me It's great to have
[SPEAKER_00]: you on finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had so many requests for you But my
first question for you today is what are
[SPEAKER_00]: you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well recently, you know, I just actually
we did a Release with the dispensary Verde
[SPEAKER_01]: so You know, I started working with them
in the beginning of the year you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave them some genetics and Finally,
we got you know, the final product out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we started this discussions in
December I got those guys some pollen some
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and Finally we got a final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we right now We're in the process of
you know hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean we I mean we did like I don't
know like maybe like a thousand seeds or I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know exactly the exact count but um,
I think we did about 200 200 of the mango
[SPEAKER_01]: black man black PIFS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry the black PIFS and so that was
the first release and So I think out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the 200 I think we had a little over a
hundred females So just you know going
[SPEAKER_01]: through all the different phenotypes,
you know Judging them by smell You know
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that they grow we did some test
washing and You know just doing overall
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluation of the flower and everything So
we had to do that with the black PIFS and
[SPEAKER_01]: now this week we just released the sour
2018 The New York City chem f2s some star
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie There was the chem Z and the UW
back cross so I've been sifting through
[SPEAKER_01]: all this flower and you know Judging it
and you know, I have to go back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: team with my recommendations of my top
three of what I like and everything so
[SPEAKER_01]: luckily for Me this all fell on the
holiday weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of enjoying myself That's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like hearing for a good weekend
You you just mentioned so many strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was interested to talk to you about
so thank you for that the mango PIF That's
[SPEAKER_00]: an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like there's a growing demand
for those sorts of sativas nowadays?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean the PIF has always been
A staple in New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's always been you know,
the people that grew up in the New York
[SPEAKER_01]: metro area most of them know about that
haze and So, I mean it's always had a
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation Kind of like the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really you know comes from
the same the same area that the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel blossomed out of and so I just
think that a lot of people just You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might have heard about it read about
it, but never got to experience experience
[SPEAKER_01]: it so You know, I was breathing I had done
a you know, a lot of breeding with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the mango stuff and then You know,
I had the the black haze years ago and I
[SPEAKER_01]: did a breeding with it and so I had
acquired the PIF S1 clone, so I thought it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be You know the perfect choice for
the the mango the mango Nigerian black
[SPEAKER_01]: haze and that was the male times the the
PIF S1 so that was that that's what made
[SPEAKER_01]: the the black PIF that were Currently that
we currently released Wow, that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: great to hear I'm I'm one of those people
you described who's heard so much about
[SPEAKER_00]: the PIF but obviously never tried it I
guess the the first question that I sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of Think about is you hear a lot of names
thrown around like with like uptown haze
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuban black haze the PIF Are they all the
same thing or are they different?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just different kind of slang terms
for for that for that strain, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same as the a5 the a5 from
Amsterdam or the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're a little bit different You
know the a5 is Was a little bit meatier I
[SPEAKER_01]: think but it was still kind of that same
Colombian pissy type of genetics Which was
[SPEAKER_01]: very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that you know never ever
really commercially released That strain I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that was something that you know,
he had a small release of at the time and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and these are and this is what
had Survived out of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously they have the a5 I think the cat
Sue in Amsterdam has that's one of their
[SPEAKER_01]: house strains and it's been a staple,
you know for Amsterdam for a long time and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the same could be said for the the
black haze, you know, which was you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out of Florida originally that's
where they you know originally started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing it and then commercial shipments
would come up to New York City and so
[SPEAKER_01]: There was always a New York Miami There
was always a that was always like a
[SPEAKER_01]: cocaine route With guns and drugs etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So A lot, you know back then, you know,
all that was just you know balled into one
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were trafficking stuff back and
forth bringing up, you know a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: Up into New York and then once they got
established, I think they started
[SPEAKER_01]: producing You know some of the stuff up up
into New York in New York City area So I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember hearing couple bus back in the
day and it was up uptown and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the Dominicans and and those guys
up there that were running that stuff So I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean even to this day, they still have a
stranglehold on that strain Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's I think that's one of the most
interesting aspects about it is how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still so tightly held and so elusive I
guess another thing which came out about
[SPEAKER_00]: your previous answer was that you work
with the s1 and it made me wonder Do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the real one still exists or
maybe the s1 is the best we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I think that you know the real one
still exists I think you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just Reacquired the the black haze
Cutting I haven't finished it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't verify it but There seems to be
a lot more people in the community that
[SPEAKER_01]: are using it now It's getting passed
around a lot more now, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's you know That was around,
you know, ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I had done some work with
it, you know, maybe nine ten years ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: You know people just you know weren't
really interested in haze really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there were a few people but
really since the death of Neville it seems
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's been a re you know,
a re violation of of interest of the haze
[SPEAKER_01]: so You know and then you know with you
know with with people now You know talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the black haze and epiphyllum more
and it being a little bit more available
[SPEAKER_01]: People I thinkers, you know, once they try
it, you know Then you know, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in growing it and and and my
phenos are going about 70 to 77 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so You know with the you know
with the breeding that I've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it originally started with nl5
haze times the Nigerian and then back
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed into the Nigerian and then crossed
into the the mango haze and that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: made the mango Nigerian and that was
basically, you know an earlier Sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: string because there was a little bit of
indigo with the nl5 in it and then in then
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the Nigerian was an early
finishing sativa then crossed into the
[SPEAKER_01]: mango and that was kind of early finishing
because that was you know, that was the a5
[SPEAKER_01]: time skunk one, I believe and So that was
a little more indigo in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So You know the lines basically have been
kind of bred with a little bit of indigo
[SPEAKER_01]: in them but you know, they were way more
sativa leaning and just really just cut
[SPEAKER_01]: down a flowering time and On on a lot of
those long flowering sativas, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so then I you know, you know, then I
crossed that into the black into the black
[SPEAKER_01]: haze and then obviously I crossed that
into the the The s1 which was an early
[SPEAKER_01]: finisher, but the s1 I felt Kind of fell
short for me on I mean it was really
[SPEAKER_01]: crystal II and it finished Early in it and
when you smelled it and it was grown it
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled really piffy and everything but
when you smoked it, it didn't have that
[SPEAKER_01]: that psychedelic sativa Effect to it and
when I say that when you smoke this it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much like a head high and You can
take a big hit and blow it out and close
[SPEAKER_01]: your eyes And you'll just feel the effect
of of the third eye and a lot of moving
[SPEAKER_01]: Parts inside of your head almost it's kind
of hard to describe when you You know when
[SPEAKER_01]: you smoke some of these psychedelic
sativas, you know, they're more of an up
[SPEAKER_01]: high more clear You know, you'll get a
little racy a little a little heart race,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know You feel your heart, you know
beating a little bit and you know for the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasoned smoker, you know You're able to
handle that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you give that to someone that's not
a seasoned smoker, you know, they'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they'll start to get anxiety the
racy effect and what I call cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: overdose When you it's almost like when
you eat too much edibles, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get the feeling that you're almost
gonna die Your heart is racing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're breathing heavy you feel
uncomfortable and You know, you just got
[SPEAKER_01]: you know with you know experienced smokers
know that you know that you know That you
[SPEAKER_01]: just got to kind of just chill out and
relax and you know It's gonna go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for people that you know, don't really
know they start getting more They just
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to the paranoia of the whole
thing and they don't you know Instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to relax they go in and start
getting more You know upset about it and
[SPEAKER_01]: it just contributes to their you know,
some people go don't go to the hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: and So Yeah, great answer, you know,
I hope all of our listeners have been
[SPEAKER_01]: there at least once Well, if you ate too
much edibles we've all been there at one
[SPEAKER_00]: point or another yeah, it's interesting
that Like the positive feedback loop you
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we've all been there at some
point or another Something interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: that you just referenced is like it's it's
so impressive that you're able to cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering time To you know,
like 70 days ish because those strains
[SPEAKER_00]: often go a lot longer But something I
specifically wanted to ask you in relation
[SPEAKER_00]: to that anxiety feeling is I think I'm one
of the only people who says this but I get
[SPEAKER_00]: that feeling from the c5 and I love it I
like I love anxiety inducing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a very Like non-popular
opinion to express but I think I'm the
[SPEAKER_00]: only one who prefers the c5 over the a5
Where do you fall on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer one over the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more of an a5 guy because I like that
pissy kind of Yeah, Colombian where the c5
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of more that floral tie and Which
is nice but I guess More of the
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic feeling from from the a5 Yeah,
and I guess you know the combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: the both would be you know equivalent to
the Neville's Hades Yeah, gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's that's one I've yet to try
but it would be be really nice I'm betting
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, no, I mean I've been able to try
some good samples in the past and You know
[SPEAKER_01]: the real good ones you kind of get a blend
of both, you know, surprisingly enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and Yeah, that's the only way to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lovely stuff there lovely stuff Okay
to bring us back to sort of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: question about like sort of what are you
smoking and you mentioned the facilities I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess another question I'm interested in
asking you is if a facility was to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and ask to use some of your genetics
What are some of the genetics that you
[SPEAKER_00]: think would do better in a facility as
opposed to say just like A home grow where
[SPEAKER_00]: you know certain factors aren't as big of
a deal What are the ones you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: straight away for facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean you got to go to you know
that the store dogs the guavas The
[SPEAKER_01]: original New York City diesels,
you know a lot of that lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a staple, you know of the
brand for for for the you know for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time You know and it depends on what
direction they want to go with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a lot of it depends on you know
What the facility you know, like the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm working with now are more into
fino hunting looking for Finos that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to produce turps and hash and good
flour and So they're doing some research
[SPEAKER_01]: and development, you know, so You know
each plate, you know, not a lot of places
[SPEAKER_01]: are really willing to do that They want to
you know, they have a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: space dedicated to their canopy and really
They want to you know maximize,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know every square inch of that and so,
you know depending on you know You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really depends on you know,
the the business model of the business
[SPEAKER_00]: itself Yeah, that's that's so promising to
hear that they're willing to do that fino
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting because I mean I think a sentiment
expressed by many guests in the past is
[SPEAKER_00]: that by doing that you sort of create your
own brand image because you've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: unique Thing that like no one else has
because you you went and found it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of that It's you know, like a star
dog from JJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what more could you ask for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right and it becomes almost an exclusive
so become your own exclusive house strain
[SPEAKER_01]: or fino of that strain and so you can call
that your own and Be exclusive with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know as well as I do,
you know, if you get you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really popular Fino type that's really
special that you know in like just say
[SPEAKER_01]: just like a GMO for for example,
you know, if you're able to find something
[SPEAKER_01]: of something of that magnitude and keep
that, you know in house as your own now,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously you're going to be able to
attract that You know, you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: market to you because of that so and I
think that's really going to be the the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of cannabis is really going to be
branding and and strains and really kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of on the level of wine and beer as in
micro brewing and you know, you really you
[SPEAKER_01]: know as a as a cannabis brand,
you know, you really got to define
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself on who you want to be Who who are
your customers who your customers want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to be a Gucci or do you want
to be a Walmart?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I mean, you know each each
each model can be profitable and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so But you know you have to you know
Define on who you want to be and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a you know, they're kind of
connoisseur, you know and attract
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledgeable people Or do you want to be
the kind of business that's just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Attract people that they're that are not
in a know that are not regular smokers
[SPEAKER_01]: they come in they're one and done and
you'll never see him again and so and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of it is you know based on Price
point, you know, so a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: just based on you know, they only want to
spend so much money Maybe they only smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: once or twice a week So, you know quality
to them is not going to be a big
[SPEAKER_01]: difference Where you have a guy that's you
know smoking every day and or if they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical patient So, you know, you know
when you really you know break down the
[SPEAKER_01]: customer pool it gets quite intricate in
in the different type of people that Can
[SPEAKER_01]: be your customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really got to you know,
think about who you want to be Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: most definitely that's a nice run down
there and I guess the last sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: question before we move to a different
topic is We see a few different breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: working with facilities nowadays Do you
suspect that not just for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: But sort of across the board in the
industry that this will be the way
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders move in the future where they try
to Pair up with facilities or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's maybe not a big trend per se?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think you know, it's really going
to be up to the facility and how they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to brand themselves and so You know if you
know if they just want to create their own
[SPEAKER_01]: brand You know and which is quite
difficult but possible, you know built on
[SPEAKER_01]: quality or Whatever your selling point is
going to be You know, otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're going to have to go with
recognized brands in the industry and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you know, I've said this before,
you know You know good weed comes from
[SPEAKER_01]: Good strains good strains come from good
clones and good clones come from good
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds So, you know a lot of you know the a
lot of corporate people don't Really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know understand this concept and this
thing you can just go out and get get
[SPEAKER_01]: someone weed get you know get whatever you
know weed is weed and So, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know really gonna really goes down to
you know the the type of people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: running the business And you know,
do they smoke pot themselves or they
[SPEAKER_01]: connoisseurs themselves or they just you
know a corporate fun just you know
[SPEAKER_01]: discounting the money so, you know,
there's a big difference between the two
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know when you're In touch and out
of touch with the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it depends on you know who
you want to appeal to and but you know for
[SPEAKER_01]: me I see you know, like I said I see as
being as branding as being You know like
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're gonna go into you know,
like the New York structure is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not going to be integrated
so, you know as a Dispensary you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to buy wholesale from anyone
across the board So, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so and you know, so if that's the case
now, you know, you know What's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: separate each each brand from itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just really going to be the
name and reputation on how good the
[SPEAKER_01]: product is So, you know in the end that's
really you know, you know, what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: win out is you know who?
[SPEAKER_01]: has the best product consistently and You
know, so I mean that and that's the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that I see, you know the market,
you know eventually moving to because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know You know, you know when I go
shopping, you know in a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm looking for the diesels the
Kems the cushions, you know anything with
[SPEAKER_01]: the fuel the high end, you know And so,
you know, that's just a kind of and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to Travel and that's just a kind
of customer that I am and I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain types of strains and certain types
of quality so You know, it doesn't pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: me, you know just to get some average,
you know some average stuff for for cheap,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because It doesn't matter how
much I smoke of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna be satisfied, you know But
when you smoke some cam or some Some some
[SPEAKER_01]: fire, you know, you could you just got to
take one or two good puffs You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: once you blow that out, you just get that
warm fuzzy feeling and almost like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know warm blanket, you know over you
know over you and you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you know, I can't really
You know get from something else that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, even if I smoke You know a pound of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't you know, so it just does not have
the same effect for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, great sentiment express there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love if you could take me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about 13 years old and It was I
think it was it might have been Christmas
[SPEAKER_01]: Day and It had snowed and when we were
kids we used to go out You know shovel
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewalks and driveways for money so we
had snowed, you know, and my next-door
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor called me up, you know,
and again, let's go out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's do some shoveling so we go out,
you know, we had our regular people that
[SPEAKER_01]: we used to you know shovel on a regular
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were heading over to the one
people's house and we decided,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we cut through some woods and we
stopped and He pulled out a joint,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and he had older brothers and so
and I was the oldest one of my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So You know, I had never seen any,
you know weed before anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we you know He he lit it up
and you know, we smoked it and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of feeling a little silly and
everything and we started shoveling and We
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't finish the job, you know,
we got like, you know, we're just so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know kind of silly and you know,
it was just so much work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just kind of bailed out of it and just
and just walked away from the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then after that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have been in like seventh grade
and you know and you know, I was in middle
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I you know, there were maybe a couple
other times that you know, we had gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember we had bought a nickel bag from
someone and that was like five dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: worth and so We all you know, there's
three of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all you know chipped in bought this
nickel bag from an older guy in the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we smoked a couple bowls of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were down by the river and you know,
so we smoked a couple bowls and then a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of these older kids started,
you know coming around and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: having this big party down where we were
hanging out and so, you know, we were
[SPEAKER_01]: started hanging out with them and so we
were smoking a little bit and some guy was
[SPEAKER_01]: like who's got some weed and so and we
were like, oh, we got some so we showed
[SPEAKER_01]: him the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I'll give you 15 bucks for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so we had already smoked,
you know, like three or four bowls and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we sold it for 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we each wound up,
you know, getting high for free and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting five bucks each, you know,
and so we were really psyched about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that was one of the
other early experiences I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really didn't start using regularly
until I got into high school, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I got into ninth grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I got there, I mean, there was
like a smoking area on the school grounds
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was a tree there and it was on a
little bit of a knoll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like a little bit of a little
bit of a hill there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all the kids used to just,
you know, gather up in the morning before
[SPEAKER_01]: school and everyone used to smoke
cigarettes there and everyone used to just
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a circle around the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you can get into that
circle and everyone would be smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, back then they used to
sell joints for a dollar and they would
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would have them in cigarette
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, someone someone would come
out and they'd fucking open up their
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette pack and be like dollar joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, they would, you know,
everyone in that circle would just start
[SPEAKER_01]: buying joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you would get up with your
friends and be like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, yeah, we got five dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you'd make a deal,
be like, all right, give us six for five.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got six for five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we would plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to smoke one one
joint in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll smoke, you know, one at lunchtime,
one after school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to, you know, so we, you know,
we would have all that weed like planned
[SPEAKER_01]: out for the whole day on how we were going
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we were only kids back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you had, you know, three,
four or five kids, you know, and you each
[SPEAKER_01]: put up a dollar or two, you know,
all of a sudden you had, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, ten bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you'd be like, all right, give me
twelve for ten or, you know, so you'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to cut deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's how you survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were kids, you know, going to
school, we did this with our lunch money
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, we didn't work and just got
money from our parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we were just trying to get
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a nice little stroll down memory
lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't fault you if you don't
know the answer to this, but do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you were smoking at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Early on, you know, there was really no
names, you know, there was really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like Mexican and Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so that was like early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was always some Hawaiian and
there was exotic around, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was really hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of blonde hash,
the red hash, black hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But around in the early, I'd say,
I don't know, eighty one, eighty two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the real first we called a
Christmas tree sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really when the first real
kind buds started coming around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember, I think it was used to be
able to get it for like two hundred bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: an ounce, you know, which was a lot of
money back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people, I mean,
you could maybe sell a gram for ten bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, you know, it wasn't really,
you know, you know, much of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: of a profit margin because, you know,
back then, you know, like I was telling
[SPEAKER_01]: you, there were dollar joints and,
you know, a half ounce would be like
[SPEAKER_01]: twenty dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: An ounce would be forty dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be kind of this year,
typical commercial type of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, out of an ounce, you can maybe
you should be able to roll, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fifty to sixty joint, depending how big
they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how people would sell for a
dollar each, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, yeah, the Christmas tree sense
used to come around and used to be good
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, and I also remember when I
was in school, the janitor start was
[SPEAKER_01]: selling weed and he used to get and he had
his brother lived in Harlem and up in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that he used to get the weed
was coming from Harlem and he used to get
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, and it was I think it
was fifty dollars an ounce, which there's
[SPEAKER_01]: either 50 or 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it was more expensive than
your regular standard commercial weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, people used to laugh at
him because there used to be this guy
[SPEAKER_01]: stymie and he used to sell these joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, people used to we used to know
his route to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would like they used to wait for
him to cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cut him off before he got onto the
grounds because when he used to get stymie
[SPEAKER_01]: joints, there were these big, huge bombs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could actually unroll them and get two
joints out of the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, so, you know,
so, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I had these little skinny
pinheads and like, you know, that people
[SPEAKER_01]: used to ridicule me like I had to
toothpick this and that, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you smoke that, man, it fucked
you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, a lot more than than the
regular stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the janitor was, you know,
you know, then my friend showed me what he
[SPEAKER_01]: was getting from the janitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hooked up with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just getting like,
you know, I was just getting ounces from
[SPEAKER_01]: him and just selling it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I just pulled that rainbow
weed and but it had all different colors
[SPEAKER_01]: and it had like some red, some green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some brown, some gold had all different
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I suspect that was some type of Thai
weed or something like that, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: just remember that just being,
you know, some of the strongest stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was explained to you, you know,
once people smoked it, they were just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, let me get some more of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, you know, another memorable
stream today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also remember getting like some some
real gold, some real Colombian gold,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Santa Marta gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine, he had an older brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had two older brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I guess one of the older
brothers, I think it just came down the
[SPEAKER_01]: line of brothers, the older brother got
it, gave it to the gave it to the other
[SPEAKER_01]: brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he gave it to the younger
brother, who was my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wound up getting like I think we got
an ounce of it and we split it half and
[SPEAKER_01]: half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I remember that just being
bright gold, like, you know, like and back
[SPEAKER_01]: then there was the real gold and then the
fool's gold, which they called.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fool's gold was the stuff that
looked gold, but it was just trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to call that fool's gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real gold was kind of hazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had like this hazy type of tip to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just remember it being seedless and
this kind of bright yellow gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just kind of having that
real sativa type of look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ever if you're familiar with
Lawrence Chernak, he has a cannabis book
[SPEAKER_01]: and he actually has a picture of some some
gold in there and it looked exactly the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I saw that picture,
I was like, that's what we got back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was only able to get it once,
but it was memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how things were back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you would see something you get
at once and.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it, you know, and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great little history lesson right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, something people probably notice
when they look at the collective work done
[SPEAKER_00]: by Top Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's obviously
sort of this Indica side of things with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the chems and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also the sativa side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that this sort of exposure to
these really sort of quite legendary
[SPEAKER_00]: strains at the young age instilled in you
a sort of a love for those sativas,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it more so you just want to provide
a bit of everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you kind of, you know, hit it on the
head, you know, I really built the brand
[SPEAKER_01]: on things that I like and experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I know that I'm a little
older than most of the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able I was able to experience,
you know, a lot of things early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to catch kind of what I call
the late 70s Cheech and Chong era era of
[SPEAKER_01]: what I explained to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of, you know, twenty dollar halves and
forty dollar ounces and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff where that kind of changed in the
early 80s early to mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once, you know, the drug war really
stepped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what really cultivated the
whole indoor scene, because in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: 80s, you know, I remember that's when
Ronald Reagan came into he came he was the
[SPEAKER_01]: president, you know, and I was in high
school from 80 to 84.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when he first took over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, within the first two years,
you know, things started to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the last two years, you know,
you know, like I said, things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, started to change a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, by the time I got out of
high school, by 1985, the government
[SPEAKER_01]: really put a halt on a lot of the imports
that were coming into the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that prompted a whole a whole shift in
the drug trade to where they started
[SPEAKER_01]: importing cocaine instead of bales of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by 1985, 1986, the streets just became
flooded with imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just started to import and import and
imported cocaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and there wasn't much import marijuana
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking back at that time in history,
you know, up in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of like when the indoor grows
of Seattle, Greg McAllister, the NL guys
[SPEAKER_01]: up there, they started those indoor grows
in the early 80s during those times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so that just really kind of
prompted the whole indoor thing where
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where it became a game because of
the pressure of the imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people were just like, well,
we'll just start producing it ourselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the point to where we just started to
become a self-efficient producing country
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have never experienced
what a drought, meaning where you couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I said, back in the 80s,
it was easier to get cocaine than it was
[SPEAKER_01]: to get weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, it became very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, and that just kind of prompted
the whole indoor scene to where it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of evolved into today, to where it's kind
of amazing if you really kind of look back
[SPEAKER_01]: at the history of it or really know
anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fascinating sort of way to view
back on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all makes perfect sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the rise of the drug war and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think back to when you were talking
about how you befriended the groundskeeper
[SPEAKER_00]: and you sort of got access to the better
quality stuff, it's clear that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a good networker, which I'm sure has
helped you a lot over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember any of the strains that
you were seeing from those indoor grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, before chem came out, sort of like
80s slash super early 90s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any memorable ones that you can
remember at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I remember seeing my first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a guy who was in Times Square
in New York City, on 46th Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was in between Broadway and Sixth
Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that was like a block away,
right from the center of Times Square.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was the weed dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had hooked up with him in the
late 80s, mid to late 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just, that's where I used to
go and buy my weed from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would have regular Mexican weed,
which was green and sellable, like an
[SPEAKER_01]: upper mid, we used to call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would get exotic strains and
different stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he wound up monopolizing his building
and wound up getting like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the building itself maybe had only like,
I think it had an apartment on each.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two apartments on each floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was one guy that was in the
building and he rented one of the places,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he also lived up in Albany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wasn't in the building much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was like a music repair
store downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he wound up getting the next
three apartments all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he sold weed out of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had one that he had storage out of,
that's where he stored his weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one, he had a little
grub.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was probably like in the late
80s, like 89, 90, somewhere in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these guys were going to Amsterdam
and getting the early skunk, the silver
[SPEAKER_01]: pearl, a lot of the sensey type of
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were growing them, and they had
this little hydro setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was some of the first indoor
stuff that I had seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most of that stuff was seeds that
came over from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then, I was really green and wet
behind the ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really have a lot of
knowledge about it, but I had an interest
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was probably about that time
that I actually started collecting seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would get a bag of good weed and find a
seed out of it and save it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, maybe one day I'll
be a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, unfortunately, that seed
collection got seized by the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my many brushes with the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was even before I really decided
to be a grower too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess the next question for me
is, what was it that stimulated you to
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing as opposed to just sort of
being involved in it all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll go back even a little bit
farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, like I said, I had this
guy in Times Square who was my pot dealer
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone from my town was going to
this guy and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had heard that one of the kids
from our town was selling weed up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Central Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, if that kid can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I can do it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the guy was a total loser.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went up there and I checked out the
scene, but it was late in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went up there and it was up in Sheep
Med up in Central Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just the open free drug market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way I could describe it of
people just walking around selling acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms, weed, hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would sell beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could just sit down and this
used to be able to smoke and people used
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, they'd have circles of kids
just all around different circles of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people would bring guitars and drums
and have little circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it was just a really cool
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow, I can't believe this,
you know, but it was, it was late in the
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, I'm going to come out
next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I wound up, you know,
getting some really good, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some really good green came in and we used
to call it pretendica because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like real indigo, but it had a few
seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the real indigo was seedless,
but this stuff was like, kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: squishy and like spongy, but there was a
little bit, there was a little,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were a few seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was more expensive than your
regular commercial, but it was well worth
[SPEAKER_01]: it because, you know, the price,
you can kick up the price of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can find, you know,
someone that wasn't really in the know and
[SPEAKER_01]: you could squeeze all of them seeds out of
it, you could, you know, sell that off as,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as, you know, as kind buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you know, I was able to get,
you know, I think like five pounds of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I, and I just squirreled
that away thinking, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to be what I'm going to
bring out to the park in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the day came, you know,
you know, I might've scouted out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and went up there one day and
seen it was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I was like, all right, I'm going to
go out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got, I had all my, you know,
had my pretend to come with me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I hit the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I go through one of the side
gates and I start walking through and I
[SPEAKER_01]: see some guys sitting under a tree with a
guitar, with his girlfriend, listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grateful Dead on, on a little radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to myself, Oh, wow, this guy's got
to be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go over to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I try, you know, hustling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, you know, I'm trying
to sell them weed, this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he says to me, well, let me show
you what I have, what I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, he, he whips out some real kind
bud, you know, I'm just like, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm blowing away, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, you know, so I get friendly
with the guy and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we become friends and,
and so, you know, and I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to learn the ropes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was kind of hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: With him and he would tell me,
you know, this guy's, but watch out for
[SPEAKER_01]: this one or that one or, you know,
so, um, you know, we were sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: one day and some guy comes strolling up
and the guy's name was Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Hey, Ben, he's like,
you know, and I guess that someone had
[SPEAKER_01]: sent him out there to look for Ben because
Ben was a known kind bud dealer in central
[SPEAKER_01]: park.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, this guy comes up and he's like,
Hey, you know, I got some kind bud that I
[SPEAKER_01]: grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to buy some?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, Ben is like,
yeah, I only have, you know, X amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars for X amount of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he looks to me and he's like,
do you want to buy some?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, I'll buy, you know,
I'm like, I'll buy some, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because back then I trying to find
someone, you know, to try to find a grower
[SPEAKER_01]: was just, like, you know, I was like
hitting a gold mine, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause it was just so, you know,
there were people out there were doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but finding those people was just so far
and few in between that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, it was very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when I really got the first
chance, other than the guy that I knew in
[SPEAKER_01]: central, I mean, in, um, time square who
grew, but, you know, I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited, you know, to be able to
buy some.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe like a week or two
later, I'm out there by myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Ben's not around, but who do I
see walking across the meadow is the kind
[SPEAKER_01]: bud guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yo man, come on over,
you know, and he's like, yo, where's Ben?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what, you got some kind?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yeah, I got, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, I'll take it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he used to come in with quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were like six grand quarters where
he used to come in with, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I was like, I'll take them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, um, you know,
I hooked up with the guy and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately for Ben, he wound up,
um, getting all fucked up on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I was just out there on
a regular basis, just grinding away and
[SPEAKER_01]: started working with this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, this guy wound up being
the weasel, you know, this was,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was the guy he came out originally
with some, uh, he used to call it the RFK
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story behind that was that him and
a friend had gone to a dead show down and
[SPEAKER_01]: down, uh, RFK stadium down in Washington,
DC and bought a bag of kind and they had
[SPEAKER_01]: some seeds in it and they, uh,
they split up the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they both decided to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they both started growing
and they needed a place to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they came out to the park, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, his original product was the
RFK one, two, and three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, after that, he wound up,
um, going to a fish show and meeting Greg,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem Dog, Greg, and so I guess,
you know, uh, they, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: back then, like one grower meeting another
grow was another big thing because all
[SPEAKER_01]: right now I have someone that I can trust
trade, uh, genetics and information with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, that's, you know,
Greg was growing the Chem 91 in the super
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk and, you know, my friend had the RFK
and, you know, I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: might've had some stuff from Amsterdam,
but, um, he wound up driving up to
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts from Staten Island,
uh, bought the, you know, traded,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for the Chem 91 and super mass
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he brought that down to,
uh, to a Staten Island, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, and by that time I had kind of,
you know, uh, cornered that whole market,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning like I told him, listen,
you know, I'll buy everything you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pay you COD, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, he loved that, you know,
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was like, Hey, listen, you know,
doing, you know, business up here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: park, isn't really a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should go down to wetlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's like down to wetlands,
you know, it was a bar and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on Tuesday nights, you have grateful dead
nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so you can go downstairs and
they had like drum circles and guitars and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they, they, they let you, you know,
smoke weed down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we would, you know,
meet up down there and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wound up meeting AJ down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he just kind of just
sniffed us out because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would wait for him,
you know, and people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people knew who I was and they'd be out
asking me for weed and I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, wait, wait, wait, you know,
and so I'd be waiting for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would see him come over to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we would do our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and once, you know,
when we were doing our business,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, you know, I would take a bag
out and open it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soon as I would open that bag,
I would just permeate the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people would just be there like
standing there, like staring at us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then eventually that's how
kind of AJ caught on to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I reached a point
where he'd be like, Hey, listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to the back office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back and do, do, do our deals
back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so we, you know,
all started, you know, getting friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: and we used to smoke back there and it
became exclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I was able to,
you know, um, you know, that was just the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of the whole, you know,
the whole chem story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, when, you know,
he, you know, he started, um, doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he created, you know,
the under the underdog, which was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, NL super skunk times chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, he was running that,
um, he was also running some others,
[SPEAKER_01]: some other strains in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's where we suspect
the, you know, the sour diesel came out
[SPEAKER_01]: of, because, you know, I told you earlier
that, you know, I used to collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, once the chem started coming
around, I used to collect seeds out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, once I started growing,
when I first started growing, I popped
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them chem seeds and they came out,
you know, very sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I remember, um, I wound up
giving, I remember I sexed the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: knew it was a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I gave it to my friend and I
told them that, you know, that this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: female and, you know, we didn't fit,
we weren't, we weren't able to finish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when he finished it, you know,
he wound up, uh, coining that the guava
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that was, that was the
original guava, but not the guava.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we know today, you know, and,
uh, so, you know, the story, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, behind that is, uh,
that wound up just coming back,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as in, like, uh, as in star dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he referenced, he thought that was the
closest, uh, thing to the original guava
[SPEAKER_01]: that he remembers, but it was,
it was, it was chem genetics, but this was
[SPEAKER_01]: a different breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really, you know, I was lucky
enough to, um, to meet, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you know, the weasel and,
uh, really, you know, I see, and really
[SPEAKER_01]: what really started to happen,
you know, so I was just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: out there selling weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I met Mike and, uh, you know,
he got me interested in growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: In like 99, you know, I decided I was
going to, you know, I decided I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: start growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I did was I rented an apartment
up in, um, Washington Heights up by,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, the George Washington bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put a hydro table in there and a
couple of lights and Mike wound up giving
[SPEAKER_01]: me some, um, some, some, some,
some cuttings of the Oasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was running the Oasis from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were the very first cuttings that
I got of Oasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put them up there in that apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what wound up happening was that the
electrical box burnt out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow, you know, I, I over juiced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, uh, yeah, it was,
it didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, I walk in one day and the
lights are out and I'm like, what am I
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't fix the box myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called the super.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's saying, well, I got to get into the
apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got all my gross shit in there
and I can't let him in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a dilemma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right at that same time,
some people that I used to sell weed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they were two brothers and,
uh, they had a spot down on a building on
[SPEAKER_01]: fifth Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they knew the people that owned the
building and they were like the
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance workers of the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had charged all this money on,
on a credit card, like $15,000 worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: gross stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bought lights and tables,
hydro, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were, uh, you know, they had seen
something in a high times magazine about a
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetual sea of green harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can harvest every week, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's, you know, what they
were trying to do and it was just failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, you know, they asked,
you know, and I had told them about what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they had known that I had a little
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, when my apartment went down,
I told them, Hey, listen, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, I, you know, I have a whole
bunch of plants that are going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, just bring them,
bring them down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, and they were like, and then we
made an agreement to where I was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: help them, you know, get that room turned
around and try to help them get their
[SPEAKER_01]: money back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we, you know, formed a partnership.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I moved those plans down to Fifth
Avenue and they had, um, this maintenance
[SPEAKER_01]: area that was a pretty big space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, they made it into like a
locker room, but they made it to where,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you open one of the lockers,
you walked in through and to another room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the grow room was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, they had built a wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had these lockers that you
walk through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where the grow room was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was just kind of like
improperly put together and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were splicing into the electric
all over the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually what happened was I helped
them get their money back and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we were having problems in
a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting too hot during the
summertime and, you know, working out the
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs and they, you know, had ran some new
wires and tapped into the, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hallway electric, which was on the
other side of the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they spliced into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go in there on a hot day and it's
really hot, you know, and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn on a, an, an air conditioner and
walk out, you know, not knowing anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that I just, you know, overloaded the
circuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I'm in a city down at my
apartment or office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get a phone call saying that
the, that the fire department in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: the building and that there's a fire in
the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I hop in my car,
I drive past and sure enough, the fire
[SPEAKER_01]: department's out front and, um,
so lucky for us, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: they located, you know, I guess in the
hallway where the fire was and it was up
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, lucky for us, it wasn't on the
other, other side of the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the grow was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they popped their head up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw where the fire was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they didn't discover the,
the grow, but, you know, but neither this
[SPEAKER_01]: to say that was kind of the beginning of
the end to that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, there were, we were getting
complaints of people in the building that
[SPEAKER_01]: were, you know, like 20 stories up and
they were smelling weird because we were
[SPEAKER_01]: just exhausting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were on the bottom floor and just
exhausting out of a, um, of a window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is before, uh, charcoal filters
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were just, you just had raw exhaust
is going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing was it was, it was like,
uh, they have like courtyards and in
[SPEAKER_01]: these, in these buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where the building's kind of like,
they all kind of come together and almost
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes like a shaft in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it just goes straight up,
you know, until, you know, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: like a little space in between,
you know, the buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we were pumping out
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people upstairs, it was just,
it was just shooting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they opened their windows,
you know, they could smell weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a kid in the building that,
that I used to sell weed to, and he'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, you know, I know that there's
someone's growing weed in the building
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's these, these Russian
mobster guys are down on the first floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, and I know, I know it's gotta
be them, you know, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he didn't, he didn't know it was actually
us that were, that was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that was really, you know,
my first, uh, my first real experience in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in, in, in growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then after that,
you know, that was like a 99, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that lasted like a year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think after that ended,
you know, it took me like a year to get my
[SPEAKER_01]: ship back together on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wound up going, uh,
upstate, uh, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rented out a house, um, up by Hunter
mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's where I had my first,
uh, my own, my, my first grow myself and
[SPEAKER_01]: the people, you know, that I was,
um, you know, and then by, by this time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, the circle of growers had,
had evolved into, you know, a few more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the circle had widen widened and,
um, you know, I told them like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I want to start growing and they're
like, all right, we'll help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so they helped me, you know,
uh, build my first room, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, did it correctly,
the right setup, you know, gave me,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, gave me sour diesel clones,
which I had given them originally because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I was, I was selling the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I would be like,
all right, I know what strains sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what people want you, you do what,
what I tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I give you these clones, you grow them
and it's going to, it's going to help us
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's what I, you know,
that's where I had started to do was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting, you know, I started networking
and I was able to get the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I gave that to them and then they
gave it back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the first strains that
I started growing, uh, well on my own was
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, and then eventually I wound
up meeting a chem dog, Greg, and I wound
[SPEAKER_01]: up treating him the sour diesel for the
chem day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, and then when I first,
you know, and then once I got my own
[SPEAKER_01]: place, you know, you know, I had been,
you know, uh, selling weed all these
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like I was saying,
I would tell these people what to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, a lot of times I'd be like,
you know, we'd have certain strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, well, what happened to this
crush or this NL?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, oh, we lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, man, that fucking shit,
you know, that was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, well, whatever, for whatever
reason we lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I started growing myself and
getting these elite clones, that's when I
[SPEAKER_01]: decided I wanted to start, um,
in, you know, preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really, you know, all right,
I got this sour diesel and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right now, you know, it's the clone
only strain, you know, so we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: no, there is no sour diesel now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so I was just like,
well, you know, I was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I'm going to make my own mail,
you know, so, you know, so I was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem D and all these different
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, if I'm going to make
my own mail, I'm going to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the best weed, the strongest weed
that I have, you know, and back then it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the chem weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided, all right, chem D is what
I'm going to, you know, base my mail off
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, then I was like,
well, what are you going to use for a
[SPEAKER_01]: donor mail?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a guy going to, to, uh,
Amsterdam and I gave him, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know, get, you know,
I gave a whole bunch of lists of strains
[SPEAKER_01]: to get me some sensi seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's what he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he comes back and he had, he had the
Hindu Kush, the Afghan one, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk and now a whole bunch of different
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I, you know, I was like,
no, I'll, I'll have to grow these out to
[SPEAKER_01]: see what they are and how they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew all, you know, well,
really I just grew the Hindu Kush and
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghan out and decided that the Afghan
would be a better choice, uh, of a male
[SPEAKER_01]: donor, uh, because it was, uh,
it wasn't very dominant in, in taste and
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of had like a, a piney,
uh, you know, like a, yeah, like a kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a piney kind of, um, I'm trying to
think of the different word to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but, um, yeah, it wasn't really
dominant, you know, it was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: blandish, you know, it, it grew really
thick stemmed and single Cola,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this, just a really big top
single Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I decided, you know, that would
probably be the best, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a male donor for, you know, the cross into
the chem day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, you know, that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the first cross the Afghan Chem D
and then I, uh, back crossed into the Chem
[SPEAKER_01]: D again and made the double dog and then
did the third, uh, cross, which would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been the second back cross would,
would have made the trade dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once I made the trade dog,
you know, I decided that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that would probably be a good
representation of the Chem D, a good,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, strong male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I decided, you know,
one of the first, you know, breedings that
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do, uh, um, I had just
gotten a Chem four at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, you know,
combine two different chems and see what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, uh, that eventually became
a star dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I made those seeds, um,
you know, I just wound up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew some out myself and found the
quarry cut within the first, I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: only, I only pop like maybe like four or
five seeds and I found the quarry cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wound up, um, given,
uh, some seeds to people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: affiliated with high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the seeds got into the hands
of Carl Cushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew up the star dog, uh, found his,
uh, Fino keeper, which he entered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was in the San Francisco
medical cup in 2010 and one second place
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really kind of, you know,
put the store dog, you know, on the map,
[SPEAKER_01]: people started noticing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some, some of the other seeds got
into, um, Andre Grossman.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a freelance photographer who had a
apartment in New York city.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was affiliated with high times and he
held the, and always grew the strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was Carl Cushman's,
um, uh, strain that he brought to high
[SPEAKER_01]: times and that became the office strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any time, you know, you can,
you used to be able to go down to the park
[SPEAKER_01]: Avenue office and they might even had a
mother of the, of the strawberry cough in
[SPEAKER_01]: the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you used to be able to get clones from
it and they didn't have it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had it like really close by.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you used to be able to go down there
and be like, you know, yeah, I want some
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry cough and they would get it to
you within an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Andre started growing the Guava,
I mean, a star dog and found a Guava cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, he brought that into the
office and that also became an office
[SPEAKER_01]: stream and accessible to people,
uh, to high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, when Andre started growing it,
you know, he started obviously taking
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a centerfold of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: On it and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, getting back to the original
Guava thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that cutting started getting out
around town and my friend who I had given
[SPEAKER_01]: the original Guava to wound up getting
that cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he calls me up one day and he's like,
Oh, like I said, he's like, I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Guava back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I first, I first saw the
Guava from him, not knowing that it was my
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that I had given to, uh,
you know, so it was like a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually it all came full circle and we
figured out everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's been kind of like the,
the, the story of, of the chem dog and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the stuff that's been on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of it has come full circle
because a lot of these people have popped
[SPEAKER_01]: up on the internet and we've been able to
connect and we've been able to figure out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the chem dog story and you know,
all of that now that's really become
[SPEAKER_01]: legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a phenomenal answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, uh, everyone's going to have to
go listen to that a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just tied so many pieces of the puzzle
together for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess one of the first questions and I'm
going to have about a million questions
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I read somewhere that you were
involved in being able to help reconnect
[SPEAKER_00]: p-button Joe brand with chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is originally, um, well,
my original, um, interaction with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the internet was, you know,
I was sitting in my office one day and a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy comes in and he's like, Hey,
he's like, do you see on the internet,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where this guy is, you know,
taking credit for the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, back then I wasn't very
internet savvy or didn't really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it wasn't really, really of my
interest at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wind up, you know, going on this site
called overgrow and I see, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this guy res dog talking about sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's, that's us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I'm like, I, I know what,
you know, the whole story, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, I have all of this knowledge
and all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, um, you know, and at that
time I had been, you know, had been
[SPEAKER_01]: growing already a few years and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and then that's kind of like
when Soma came out with the New York city
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel, which we were, you know,
quite offended by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so, you know, I, I, you know,
decided to, you know, to create,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, an account and set the record
straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's where, you know,
I, I, I became a JJ, uh, NYC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I logged on there and my very first
post was just, is kind of a rant that just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, you know, kind of set the record
straight and called out Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people were kind of like
shocked by it and being like, who the fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, eventually, you know,
um, uh, the, you know, the whole chem
[SPEAKER_01]: thing started, you know, started out on
overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that, and then, um, and then,
and then it went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got, it got shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I got all kind of freaked
out by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of dropped offline for six
months to a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and then, you know,
decided, you know, to pop back on and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, found out that everyone had
moved to ICU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I started, you know,
posted on IC mag and, uh, this was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably right around the time that I had
gotten the chem day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so, you know, I remember the,
you know, the very first time I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a search on chem dog and this guy,
this guy's account popped up is called Joe
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made a post saying, does anyone
know anything about cam or dog or what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so, you know, I started a whole
dialogue with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and, uh, yeah, I mean,
eventually it just kind of led to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, you know, getting those guys
back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we figured out the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, and, and, you know,
when it was coming, you know, when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening, it was, you know, it was
really, it was really incredible to
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you know, start piecing all that
history together and figuring out the
[SPEAKER_01]: puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I was able to, you know,
we figured out that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it had, you know, that, you know,
that Greg had gotten, it was Greg and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that Greg still had some of those
original seeds left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had, you know, I hooked those
guys up and they re reunited and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Greg wound up set, send in,
uh, Joe, uh, for the original seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: he found in that dog, but, and then that
wound up being the chem one, two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I was, uh, you know,
very instrumental and doing all the,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's so impressive how
interconnected all the relationships and
[SPEAKER_00]: stories are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could just go back a moment to when
you were talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the, the Staten Island crew first sort
of linked with mass G and all those sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of things, I guess something I'd love to
ask you is what was your first experience
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you first smoked the chem 91?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was just, it was just kind of game
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we'd never saw anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like the super skunk too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you, when you would crack a
jar of that super skunk, it would just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would just permeate the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just something that, you know,
it's just something that you just cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: find today, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when people talk about roadkill and
all this other stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, I, I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I experienced it, you know,
it was something at one time and why it's
[SPEAKER_01]: changed and it's gotten lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, no one really knows the
reason why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it, you know, is people,
you could say it's genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, and, and which could be a
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it was really hard for people
to really hold on to, to a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics because they were so loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people had gotten busted,
uh, with those genetics over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I mean, yeah, I mean,
if you, if you really think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of the strains that we
have today were, are, are really
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible because of one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, if you look at the chem,
the chem, if it wasn't for Greg,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wouldn't have the chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look in, and you can go
down a list of different strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are associated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so if it really wasn't for
those people who, who preserved them and
[SPEAKER_01]: then shared them, you know, we wouldn't
have what we have today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you know, we did have those
genetics were, you know, plentiful at one
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but unfortunately, you know,
that was during a time of, of the drug
[SPEAKER_01]: war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And heavy prohibition and a lot of that
stuff just got snuffed out, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real shame, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess some of the more smelly stuff
before carbon filters is obviously just
[SPEAKER_00]: logistically hard to sort of manage
long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question or two about the Sauer
diesel for you that I was hoping you might
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to shed some light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when, around that time, when,
you know, the Sauer first came out,
[SPEAKER_00]: were people running primarily just like
one strain in a room or were there
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I guess I'm trying to figure out,
is it more likely that it was just an S1
[SPEAKER_00]: or like some sort of cross pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a little followup,
do you accept the versions given by people
[SPEAKER_00]: like Weasel or Vondo on say the Adam Dunn
show, when they talk about the Sauer
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel history, or do you think it would
maybe went down a little differently to
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see online?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do know, you know, what he,
you know, what he was growing at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that he had the 91,
he had the Mass Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the RFK stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he had the DNL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's, you know,
what, you know, I suspect, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the room hermied and got into
the 91 obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the Sauer diesel came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I mean, there's a lot of speculation
on, you know, is it Super Skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it DNL, you know, or, but, you know,
the one thing that I can point to is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk VA and he's very adamant and I'm
sure you're familiar with some of his
[SPEAKER_01]: early Super Skunk photos that kind of show
big stretch y kind of sour like plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I remember in what's also
documented in high times when they did the
[SPEAKER_01]: photo shoot of the Mass Super Skunk and of
the Chem Dog from Greg back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: that that plant was more of a more medium
squat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the plant that the weasel had
was the same exact one that Greg had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I sold the bud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it grow and it was not the big Super
Stretchy Pheno that Skunk VA had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if it was the same
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, you know, there's a whole
different story on that Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was down in Virginia originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, yeah, I think it came,
there was a trade, the Super Skunk came up
[SPEAKER_01]: from Virginia to Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Chem Dog was picked up from
Massachusetts and brought out to
[SPEAKER_01]: California to Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I don't really know what,
if that was a different Pheno that they
[SPEAKER_01]: gave him or what, you know, I know at that
time, I think Skunk VA was out in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he set up the deal with his
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was actually brought up and
traded, I mean, as anyone's guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think there's a big discrepancy
between the Super Skunk that Greg had and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the Super Skunk that Skunk VA had,
because they were two totally different
[SPEAKER_01]: Pheno types.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you want to do your research on
Greg's Mass Super Skunk and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: find out the characteristics of it,
you can, but you will find that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: that really tall, stretchy, sour-like
Pheno that Skunk VA had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who's right, who's wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we'll never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess if you can really get into
some sequencing and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some of that stuff could,
you know, come out in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, to me, it's just
speculation and I can only go by with what
[SPEAKER_01]: I know and knew at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I have my doubts on it just
because I think they're two different
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole nother story behind that,
which I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there's more, I guess there's
more investigation and reading facts that
[SPEAKER_01]: need to come out, you know, from,
I guess, the Virginia Beach crew in Skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think you might be on the money
there because when I've spoken to Skunk VA
[SPEAKER_00]: more recently, he's sort of said to me
that now that he thinks back on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Skunk cutting he got back from Greg
years later, he goes, I was so excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: have it back, you know, like, I'm like,
oh, the Super Skunk's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, but now that I really think
about it, he goes, I'm not sure it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: same plant, which is sort of what you're
saying that the plant Greg got might not
[SPEAKER_00]: have been the original one Skunk VA had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why, and I've seen Phenos
that came out of that Skunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that underdog, it was NL Super Skunk times
91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was not a big stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of grew kind of like the Kush,
but not as stretchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more of the bud structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more of a medium stout plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't yield very well, but
unfortunately that underdog, we killed it
[SPEAKER_01]: because of genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just petered out after a while and we
had the original cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen it with different
strains over the years, not only strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've grown, but strains that I've
sold, you know, and I can remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, the wheelchair used to be in the
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, the early wheelchair was
exactly that wheelchair weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you would smoke that shit and you
were incapacitated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards the end, it just kind of got like
bland and just kind of petered out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, I've seen genetic drift and
strains just kind of just dug out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it gang, part one of
three done and dusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you think?
