[SPEAKER_01]: Their unit is the most potent,
the most highly replicating of a bong hit

[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you came for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The extra part three we recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really dig this part, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to absolutely love

[SPEAKER_01]: Super upbeat and fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Bodie for coming and
recording the part three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without further delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, gang, we're back for a special
extra third part for this incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: episode with our good friend Bodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might notice our voices are a little
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've fast forwarded a little bit into the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my first question, my friend,
to follow up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the first installment of the interview,
you mentioned that, you know, that weekend
[SPEAKER_01]: coming, you were looking to jump back on
the plant medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has that happened since then?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that like, if so?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to say yes, but life is so
complex these days and there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had these, we're having this bomb
cyclone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been doing a lot of
winterizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have this, these two bags of
substrate that just won't colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also kind of putting things on
the back burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, I have been,
I have started smoking cannabis in small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts and it's been a really,
I can, it's like a deep old friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Hey, you know, it's going to be
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done that, but I haven't jumped
fully in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a little yurt up top that it's
been kind of too hot this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can manage to pull up a wood
stove or something, I think that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be like the, the kind of ceremonial
command center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll haul up all my sacred items
and I already have some Indian rugs up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, put in some cool
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's going to be the place
where it all goes down, but not yet right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, real world stuff like bomb cyclones
and weather is taking up the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can give you a pass given,
given you have been keeping yourself busy
[SPEAKER_01]: and Hey, look, it's cool to hear you're,
you're dabbling in it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good to have you back my
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, we can always use you on,
on our, on our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I gotta give a quick shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually for the first time in a very
long time, enjoying some Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking of Monte today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, it's, it's every now and again,
someone will message me and they'll remind
[SPEAKER_01]: me that like quite a few people from our
community have sort of passed away in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's, um, it's, it's easy to
think we'll all be here forever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sadly, um, you know, Monte's no longer
with us, which is a real bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think more and more people are
looking back and realizing he just made
[SPEAKER_01]: such phenomenal work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a character too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was such that he was such a,
you know, he's so driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was such a force and he could be a real
knucklehead sometimes, but you had to love
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just for the sheer, um, output,
all those, like, you know, the weed nerd
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, he was, yeah, he was such a
unique and wild guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you kind of, you don't really
realize what you have until you,
[SPEAKER_00]: until they're gone, you know, it's like,
yeah, yeah, I like sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of the very first
strains that, uh, that I saved up money to
[SPEAKER_00]: get on, uh, or is it heaven staircase?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I saved up $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put a order into heaven staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I was getting double pro
judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting all these really cool land
races and I got a couple of Cindy Chiba
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and it all went down about a week
and a half after I sent it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, okay, okay,
my money order sitting right on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, some of my first strains
that I bought and lost were, were his.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, I, at breed Bay,
we shared for a while he was predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: on breed Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shared space on breed Bay and we'd
be diametrically opposed sometimes on
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but I have a massive sub cool
collection, believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of times I wouldn't get
paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would ask for trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some point I don't really,
uh, you know, I've grown up some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: older ones, but I have so many,
so I might get those out to the community
[SPEAKER_00]: or throw those into an auction or do
something with them because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, there was, you know, I mean,
Ms. Jill's still around and she's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: driving force.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, what a, what a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone should do like a mini documentary
or something, you know, it's uncool
[SPEAKER_00]: because yeah, he was like a sacred clown,
like a Hiyoka, like there was magic to
[SPEAKER_00]: him, you know, even if sometimes he,
he did some really kooky things and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, got, uh, rub people the
wrong way, but you have to love someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just so dynamic in their self and
so passionate about what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I think back, I, I might be
mistaken, but I'm, I'm almost certain like
[SPEAKER_01]: the weed nerd sort of franchise,
you know, cause there was lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts to it, uh, was sort of my
introduction to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always got to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and definitely he was the guy,
him and the rev, you know, the two dudes
[SPEAKER_01]: who sort of inspired me to go organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heck, even if I didn't like his
genetics, which I do like them,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, he helped me to go organic,
which gosh, that's gotta be one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest game changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of got really people into the
super saw and you know, if he was around
[SPEAKER_00]: today, he was like flavor driven and like
hype driven and way before everyone kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of caught on to that, you know,
there wasn't a lot of people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: always you know, back way back,
it was in the old days, it was all about
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and strength and you Terps kind of
came a little bit later or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he Terps are great, but he was really the
one that was pushing these really two
[SPEAKER_00]: forward sometimes to a deficit,
but always like super flavorful and unique
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like, especially like on the
fruits and tropical, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I said it before, but I think that
there's a good argument to be made that
[SPEAKER_01]: space dude is the most proven male in
existence, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there've been other killers
throughout history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure some of the ones that Neville and
Sam picked over the years were up there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in terms of something we still have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be still around too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I think you'll still, does she
still use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even like controversy on
actually what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interestingly, Caleb's got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's doing a bit of work with miss
Jill on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when I asked sub about that,
you know, I said, look, when you sent it
[SPEAKER_01]: to file loss, it said it was like a C 99
back cross, like space queen cross C nine
[SPEAKER_01]: nine or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember in the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm sure I had the right Intel,
but, um, he just said that that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was like someone had just sent in
like a mislabeled cutting or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, he sort of brushed it off,
but it's interesting because.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I have spoke to a few people over
the years who had ran the remake from
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, you know, I didn't really
get anything out like space dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, uh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: A good story always has to have a good
mysterious ending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look to me, I, I love space,
dude, that, that mango to penalty and sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, it really does it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people describe it as more limey,
but I, you know, it's, it's the exact
[SPEAKER_01]: profile of the Chernobyl I'm enjoying
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Jack's cleaners still around too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a lot of weird ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I have like bubba
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like these old, old, like kind of
one-off, uh, sub cool stuff that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: always been interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have Danny boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that I might still pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's meant to be like the cold one,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that he always thought was
like one of his best works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in the fridge for a rainy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, on that topic, did you ever do
anything with any of those old Neville
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like the a five and the C five or
which ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there was a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, I got a few to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only ones I ever really used were the
a five and the C five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did like, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did like an a one C five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of like kind of more like old
school crosses and not huge amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the small little bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend who got some of Neville's
last steeds that he gave out to all of his
[SPEAKER_00]: friends before he passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though there's not a lot of
information on them, there's like six of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like, it was like his parting
gift, I believe to his friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have some of those ones that I
got on breed bay with credit when,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when he came back and he did
like super cush and he did stuff with
[SPEAKER_00]: conga Tiva and he, he put out some,
some lot, you know, he put out a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of lines and then he kind of went
back into obscurity again, or just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, I think he was working with the
Australian medical scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he could be connected so
much anymore, but there's still a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: his work that is kind of always,
it's like the Pandora's box or the
[SPEAKER_00]: treasure box.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be always more stuff coming
out, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, kind of on that topic,
one of the really common questions that
[SPEAKER_01]: popped up on the Patreon and one that I
wanted to ask is on your Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been some really nice photos of
various hybrids of the sort of more raw
[SPEAKER_01]: stock that I think a lot of it came from
Jade nectar farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff's farm.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone was keen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit more about
sort of what you found and what went along
[SPEAKER_01]: with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's, it's kind of like a
cannabis botanical garden and he's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: spot way up in the mountains and I don't
know how he does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the red woods, but he manages with
his whole team suit, all organic just to
[SPEAKER_00]: create, he just collects all kinds of
seeds from all over the world every year
[SPEAKER_00]: and he just puts them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has ones that he uses specifically for
his like his olive oil, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are pretty, pretty amazing,
but yeah, just stuff that he gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it is sometimes I wonder if
it's pure and sometimes you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was a Sinaloa this time that I
saw, I think I'll probably post a picture
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I went this year, I didn't
really take pictures cause I got there
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of late and the light was fading,
but this Sinaloa is definitely not a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this thing is raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and you know, with Mexican
varieties, there's a lot of cartel
[SPEAKER_00]: influence and there's a lot of,
I think at this point, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization, but there's still these
amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I think I said before,
it's like really a lot of these incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: lines aren't going to come from point of
origin anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come out of like,
like I said, your grandpa's stash or a
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy old uncle Larry or, you know,
or little pockets, um, people that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe that have family back in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my grandpa used that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still grows out in his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like these finding larger
grows of these and more ancestral or like
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom accessions are getting so
difficult at point of origin, unless
[SPEAKER_00]: they're places like Afghanistan or places
that have kind of a firewall of war or
[SPEAKER_00]: strife.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really it's like some of the best old
school lines are coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not coming out of current stock,
you know, even if you go like me and stray
[SPEAKER_00]: and and Doc D we went to Oaxaca and we did
a whole tour and we were getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's back somewhere on my
Instagram, but you can see all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different lines and such amazing ones,
purple ones, green ones, smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, very up electric, but they seem
to be morphologically a little bit too,
[SPEAKER_00]: not broadly, but hybridish that it seems
like maybe at some point they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, worked with, but you know,
still there's always those ones that pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you know, wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the higher you go,
like maybe in the Sierra Mazdeca,
[SPEAKER_00]: like up higher towards Puebla,
it seems like the lines are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more safe, but down by the coast with all
the surfing and stuff, you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get it, but although actually I'm
going to have to eat crow and sink my own
[SPEAKER_00]: ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in Mazunte and Zipolite a long
time ago, I got some stuff in Mazunte that
[SPEAKER_00]: was absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fully just, there was no way it
had any kind of hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just spears and the thinnest leaves
and just the most Excelsior like high,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and then, you know, in Zipolite I
got the zip and it had, it was similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe it just acclimatized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still pretty narrow leaf,
but that Mazunte like you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just saw it and you're like,
oh gosh, this looks like right out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: time machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, back to circling back around to
Jeff's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In such an incredible garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like he does a shade garden in Holger
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it finishes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, um, he's high enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't get a lot of bugs, but yeah,
he has an incredible YouTube channel too,
[SPEAKER_00]: where he bought, he shows them all and bio
essays them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some insane plants,
you know, and Robin Mojave show up every
[SPEAKER_00]: year and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had this amazing Filipino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we called him like a purple dragon
tails, which is the most amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, just so you could tell there,
they were just straight out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Jurassic park, like straight out of,
um, Filipino nature Compton, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just, just a beautiful, beautiful Fox
tailing and just the most epic purple with
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of like, I don't know,
like pepperish berry and just the most
[SPEAKER_00]: floaty, like dreamy effect, almost a
little bit like Nepali, but not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but without the drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big vote for Jade nectar's amazing,
uh, farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hopes to someday kind of create a
sanctuary or kind of like a place where
[SPEAKER_00]: people can come and like check out the
plants growing and get to sample them and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a whole kind of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the world deserves that,
you know, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like the heady version of the
Tyson cannabis ranch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that's what his original
pitch was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like come hang out, harvest some
weeds, see what it's about, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you see, I see where I was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, I was, they wanted to do like a
botanical cannabis botanical garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were talking about it, but it was so
long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's going to really
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there are big, massive,
um, you see are like a university system
[SPEAKER_00]: grows, but they're just field,
like just very just plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I don't know the terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like field sample or whatever,
but they just let everything go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll just be all their sections,
but it'll be males, females, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just, just letting it all fly and then
checking it out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are happening, you know,
and it seems like with Thailand too,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you're getting a lot of hype stuff and
a lot of stuff that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially airborne and dangerous for
hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of farmers that are
bringing their best old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even, um, people that are
involved in it, you know, like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: Zomia and I heard that maybe Deepak is
going to help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that, um, you know, there's like,
uh, that amazing lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it her name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prem Premavi.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's this woman that's a big advocate and
supporter of all the like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: old school, like backwards farmers and
bringing out like old squirrel tails and
[SPEAKER_00]: tie sticks and really trying to,
uh, champion the heirloom heritage of like
[SPEAKER_00]: Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have a bright future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can just take it back roots and
everybody just, um, you know, just find
[SPEAKER_00]: your own personal relationship with
cannabis and support the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's the same thing with,
um, uh, I was going to say with growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it's like, you know, everybody should
be growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on the, uh, uh, the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know it's, it's amazing and we
all have dispensaries cause it's so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a candy shop and they definitely
have a place, but if you can grow it and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't maybe find someone that does
a friend or a farmer or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe if we can get farmers markets,
it would be so nice to have it go
[SPEAKER_00]: grassroots so we can kind of support
things from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there'll always be a place
for a big, big ag and, and, and
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries because it's always nice for
the kids to find the Zaza and find those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a 31 flavors, you know,
it's, it's, it's your own kind of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's its own experience in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just encourage people maybe before they
give their power away to all these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always say the cannabis is the
gateway drug, not only to the
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator, but to gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I know people that started
growing cannabis and now they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, they grow peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just never stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's once you realize you can work
with nature, you know, on a heart level
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially with, you know,
non-hybridized heirloom stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like a whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nourishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so like, it's the best anti-stress,
oxygen rich, like environment that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put yourself into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, my hope one day too is all
those little ladies that have the gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: throw some feminized auto flowers of CBD
rich, like anti-inflammatory things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just next time grandma makes pasta,
throw it in to the big pasta bowl and just
[SPEAKER_00]: have the anti-inflammatory pasta party or
even like, you know, like, THCA,
[SPEAKER_00]: like who needs to, who needs to process it
with heat, you know, just eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Cheech and Chong, that Cal,
you know, it was that one movie we were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like any, the waiter brought out,
he's like, oh fine, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: but leaf salad, you know, with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the coolest things you can
do on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's our birthright.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one can tell you what you can or
can't do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I always, you know,
I got get down, I guess a little bit on
[SPEAKER_00]: science, but science is a tool and
cannabis is a like spiritual technology
[SPEAKER_00]: that is inhabiting in a, you know,
a plant body, just like we're a spiritual
[SPEAKER_00]: entity having a human experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a connection there and no
matter what science does, finding these
[SPEAKER_00]: markers and finding the, all these things
and doing all their stuff, like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful and amazing for farming
molecules and for tracking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real magic is when you inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're creating what you
inhale or your friends or things or the
[SPEAKER_00]: creations that you've done, there's a
special connection that from your heart to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and then even epigenetics,
you know, people don't talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: epigenetics enough about creating seeds
and creating strains and what the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: are beyond just, but you know,
just beyond foods and light, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: music, vibration, crystals, you,
how you feel around them, like what you
[SPEAKER_00]: do, like your process, and curing,
you know, pyramids, like there's some blue
[SPEAKER_00]: glass, myron glass, you know, there's so
many inputs that are beyond just growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the true input really is
yourself and your heart into this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I just encourage everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to get down in science and
people will be like, Oh, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one was, you know, that was
scientific reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's natural science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Mendelian breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a person that's so passionate and
dedicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: To cannabis that they took this plant that
they found and just grew it and grew and
[SPEAKER_00]: grew it through the years, doing a huge
field things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came up with something truly
remarkable and that's their legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and that's, that's still natural
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, it's, I worry about
bringing in anything you have to plug in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to plug in your computer,
you got to plug in your phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you plug in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you need that in cannabis
breeding, what you need to do is plug
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that's a, that's a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I, I agree for a number of years,
I used to take great joy in what I
[SPEAKER_01]: considered to be producing relatively high
quality harvest with what gear that people
[SPEAKER_01]: would laugh at me for having, you know,
and I, I sort of took a certain sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: pride in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and as you alluded to,
you know, that old saying the plants best
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer is the gardener's shadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pays dividends to spend time with your
plants, you know, and I talked to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends about that, you know, whether you
feel it in like a connection sort of way,
[SPEAKER_01]: or just in a practical way, I promise you
the more time you spend with your plans,
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden will flourish for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that answer, you mentioned that
you're not beating up on science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everyone who knows you knows
that you're not that sort of guy anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: but on that topic, you also mentioned
taking it back to the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take me back to your roots with a
university you're mentioning that earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it'd be good to see universities get
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, I want people to hear a bit about
your roots, your experience at university
[SPEAKER_01]: and a bit more about your backstory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will help paint a better
picture of sort of how you came to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: epic Bodhi that we know today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this strange and fascinating
creature that I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I kind of goes all the way back
to, to when I was, you know, my mom and my
[SPEAKER_00]: dad split up their hippies kind of,
and I split up when I was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was raised by my mom and
grandmothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always had like this deep kind of
feminine influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mom was like a really big green
thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had so many plants around the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always grew up around plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I got older and older, I really got
into like different, I was really into
[SPEAKER_00]: like different foods and like just the
world besides where I live, just really
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinated me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this place called cost plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this world market that has like
stuff from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember my favorite thing to do is
my mom would be like, Oh, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to cost plus to get some, do you want
to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, I'd be so down.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would just let me loose in that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd check out all the candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check out this, I would go all
around that store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of like my way to,
to experience the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as I got older and older in
high school, I, you know, I got kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced by like classic rock and
sixties punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the Grateful Dead,
I went to my first Grateful Dead show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like in 85.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bus pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my mom was, you know, back then you
could get away with a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't as dangerous like kid on the
bus, you know, who was 15 or 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 wasn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my mom got me a bus pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the things I love to do was I would
look around at the towns near me and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bus routes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my two big things were to do would be
to find new like libraries, like college
[SPEAKER_00]: or university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Libraries and also record stores,
because I love music and I would collect
[SPEAKER_00]: music and records.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I would take my bus pass and
I would go and I would go usually I would
[SPEAKER_00]: go to like I would go to UC Irvine or I'd
go to UC Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find these places that I knew had
things and I would find the books that I
[SPEAKER_00]: always would want to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd look at what rare, like I was super
influenced by, you know, like the world
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and especially different religions
and, and so-called like primitive
[SPEAKER_00]: religions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super into just different ways of
perceiving reality through the lens of
[SPEAKER_00]: like environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, you know, I look up books on
ethnobotany and magic and witchcraft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and to go back, I think the pivotal
moment, I probably said this before is I
[SPEAKER_00]: think one of the pivotal moments in who I
became as a human was my mom had a really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, groovy boyfriend when I was like
five or six and he had this amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: bookshelf with all these cool books and he
was so groovy and he actually had a health
[SPEAKER_00]: food store with my mom called Goodenough's
Natural Food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had this kind of encyclopedic of
Britannica called Man, Myth and Magic and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like 20 volumes of just every
imaginable cool weird thing about magic
[SPEAKER_00]: and man and, you know, the cold and
witchcraft, alchemy, plant sciences,
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything you could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just go to his house and I would
just sit there and read those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually, a couple of years ago,
I picked up a full set just to have,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was such this amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that kind of opened me
up to these extreme possibilities on
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but I'll loop back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as in high school,
I got really into psychedelics and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially mushrooms was one of my really
favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think going to the Grateful Dead,
one of the best things for us besides the
[SPEAKER_00]: music and camaraderie and you could still
camp back then, was the abundance of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would always go and pick up my
goodies for the next tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so there was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I got really into, eventually
into other kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the of the jungle catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go, I would also have the Church
of the Tree of Life catalogs, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the stuff where you kind of
underground stuff where you could get all
[SPEAKER_00]: these amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started experience with other
plants, you know, and I've never really
[SPEAKER_00]: got so much in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of thought it was a little bit like
a peasant tree in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was always finding new weird plants
like Roaconga or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I search out these new experiences and I
just got so into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually when I got,
I don't know if I got my car or still on
[SPEAKER_00]: my bus pass, but I would start going to
like Terrence McKenna conferences and
[SPEAKER_00]: going to different meetups and meeting
people and talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I became the youngest member of
the Albert Hoffman Society, believe it or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was still only 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go to all our things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're around anymore,
but I got to see a lot of people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan Ott and I think I saw Christian
Ratch and all these different really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic kind of ethnobotanist people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I got older and older,
I'm like, I was so driven and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to be an ethnobotanist,
kind of like Richard Evans Schultes or
[SPEAKER_00]: like Timothy Plowman or like, you know,
all these guys, Wade Davis, Mark Plotkin,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these really cool roots like
ethnobotanist, but like more on a
[SPEAKER_00]: religious tip, like really trying to
figure out what plants they use to connect
[SPEAKER_00]: to the divine or to their ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got really jazzed that me and my
friend were going to move up to Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was going to go to UCSC and do
ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow he got in and I didn't,
I think he got in because he was part
[SPEAKER_00]: Guatemalan, which was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a bum that I didn't get in,
but it actually sent me on a whole another
[SPEAKER_00]: trajectory where I got really involved
with the underground music scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I moved up, I had a smart bar in LA
and San Diego called Tribal Liquid where I
[SPEAKER_00]: made all these herbal concoctions and I
would sell them at Raves back in like 89
[SPEAKER_00]: to 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I moved up, I went to
school, I just kind of sunk back into that
[SPEAKER_00]: and we used to go to free outdoor parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized I have this amazing record
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw people DJ and I'm like,
why can't I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when I started getting into
DJing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of back when there was
pre trip hop, it was more like acid jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were doing is we were taking,
we had this group called Spaceship Gaia,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a three of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were really pushing the genres.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would get like hip hop instrumentals
and then also like drum and bass records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pitched down the drum and bass
records to 33 and then and then play like
[SPEAKER_00]: real world, like Peter Gabriel,
like, you know, he had this label that had
[SPEAKER_00]: all these kind of world music.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would drop like full on ragas and
different stuff over really fat beats and
[SPEAKER_00]: bass lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of like pre trip hop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got known for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just started having our own
group and we started a magazine and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we were doing free outdoor parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that forever until I,
you know, and then I got started playing
[SPEAKER_00]: in San Francisco and then I started
playing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I played at Shambhala a couple of
times on almost every stage they had
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, going through that,
going through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I'm like, I still want to be
an ethnobotanist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to community college and they
had a thing where if you go to the local
[SPEAKER_00]: college, they'll get you right into UCSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I eventually got into UCSC and realized
right away that ethnobotany really,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was just too much science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really, I had a different mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got into religious anthropology with
an emphasis on plants and culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to, in that, so I have a
really cool teacher who, Triloki Pandy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he really allowed me to just take it
wherever I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for two semesters, I got to do my own
semesters abroad when I did in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to tie in like sacred plant
use and Pontric science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that was just too hard of a nut
to crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just had fun in, in the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of started, you know,
introduced to Himalayan hash, which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: total revelation to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where I really realized how
amazing cannabis could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't really always put the
dots together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the very first dot, I think it
was in a previous episode, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where were you first turned on?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some really good ganja in Belize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I first really got the
cannabis hit when we smoked at these
[SPEAKER_00]: temples in Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized it just opened up a
completely different, portal to reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like I was saying before,
like that nature's wifi, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I really tuned in,
but smoking Himalayan hash was truly one
[SPEAKER_00]: of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone gets a chance to get up into
Himalayas, like it's just, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: like Himalayan hand rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just so incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to circle back once again, I keep on
losing myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second study abroad, I actually
decided to do my research thesis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was going to be the, my whole
thesis was on the intersection between the
[SPEAKER_00]: jungle and the cities, like that point,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the jungles and cities touch and
Mestizo based Ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were how in the context of Ayahuasca
and these incredible ancient systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they converge with these modern
encroaching cities, like Akitos and
[SPEAKER_00]: Pocalpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was primarily in Peru and where this,
how the ma these magical interfaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the Ayahuasca would morph and how they
would blend with these kind of like city
[SPEAKER_00]: or like city jungle shamans would interact
and even how the jungle and the city would
[SPEAKER_00]: interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of my, but I also did a
little addendum on Ayahuasca tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have never known today,
like that was 25 years ago, how it's
blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would have never thought so many
Ayahuasca centers would be going and how
[SPEAKER_00]: prolific it would be and how much it would
spread out through consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real eye-opener these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I went into the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for like five or six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in the rainy season, which I
realized now was probably the dumbest
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever goes in the rainy season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was quite an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had so many incredible adventures on
boats and ships and ship captains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we'd have to go way,
way, way in and meeting some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, amazing deep plant people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm doing an apprenticeship
and realizing through Ayahuasca that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I always thought I'd work
freelance, but I always thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never knew it was, I didn't ever thought
I was going to be cannabis was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I had this, this experience
in, after the Ayahuasca in a dream where
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like the spirit of Ayahuasca said,
you know, I know you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're initiating, but Ayahuasca
isn't your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is back at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't put it two and two
together until, you know, in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started to really get involved with
cannabis and, you know, primarily that
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement was also through DJing and
music, the entire music scene in the Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: area was fueled by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that was a DJ or an artist or a
rapper and everything, everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: subsidized it and all these free parties
with ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was the guy that was,
you know, making bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I met my previous partner who
we had kids with, she was a grower and she
[SPEAKER_00]: really was dialed into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met a lot of amazing people through
that, a lot of people that I know today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as she stepped out of it, when she was
pregnant, I just dived in head first and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just went berserk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became a freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just loved everything about it and got
into the seeds and did all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I never stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that brings us up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I made it out of the Amazon
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got back, I graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that you can't really do much
with a religious anthropology degree
[SPEAKER_00]: besides teach or do demographics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I pivoted into really following
my passion and following what the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: told me was my destiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's kind of my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I missed a lot of stuff,
but that's it in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always love hearing that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even having heard most of that before,
still some bits I hadn't heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's beautiful to get that backstory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, it's, it's, it's perfect because it
ties into the next question, which one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the patron users submitted, but it's just
a cracker of a question in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sort of saying, look, I'd be
interested to hear Bodhi's thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: when, how, who, uh, was involved in
cannabis first entering into the Americas,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly narrow leaf drug types in
South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously a few different
theories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it European exploration?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it slave trade?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it pre post Columbus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a lot of theories out there,
but because Bodhi's work with so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different NLDs, I'd be interested to hear
his thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm going to have to say there is
definitely a lot of information that
[SPEAKER_00]: points to certain sources, but there's
also a lot of things that we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like definitely, I think you had a lot of
African narrow leaf drug types moving with
[SPEAKER_00]: the slaves, you know, and, uh,
bringing it with them and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different places throughout Brazil,
you know, even Guiana, like everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to have these things and it was an
equatorial place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew well, they worked well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a panacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's also some of the theories
that, you know, early in the Americas,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there was these kind of, uh,
they call them like, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Snake oil medicines, patent medicines,
all these kinds of medicines that with
[SPEAKER_00]: people were providing the early kind of a,
uh, drug store concoctions and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: using like, uh, kind of, uh, these in,
uh, import Indian stock there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I heard that it was hard to
get the cannabis over in ships without it
[SPEAKER_00]: molding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually part Davis and a couple
other people that were starting to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, realized that if they brought seeds,
over and planted seeds, they would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that w you know, was a lot quicker
to ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, it wouldn't, uh, it would be
more prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a lot more, uh, um,
you know, money, uh, it would be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less money to have it within reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I understand, I'm still
looking for, I'm sure maybe like Snow High
[SPEAKER_00]: or someone has the documents, but I heard
that park Davis brought a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains into Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that a lot of these Mexican
strains are actually, uh, acclimatized
[SPEAKER_00]: Indians and, um, from different,
uh, not necessarily Himalayan,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think a predominant amount of the
stuff produced was, uh, uh, kind of near,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like a prune job and kind of these
drier, arid places, uh, where they would
[SPEAKER_00]: farm it, you know, and before that in the
stands, you also had like Xinjiang and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these like places just over the border
that were producing tremendous amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard that a lot of these strains
in, especially in just Mexico itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there wasn't a lot of slaves coming
in so much, um, the populations were a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these are escapees of maybe part
Davis's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there, you know, there was
slave ships, I know in Guatemala,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the Garifuna, which are a really
unique, uh, section of people that were a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole, I think they were Yoruba or they
were, it was, uh, it's a whole population
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, African Guatemalans where a slave
ship crashed or hit rocks and they all
[SPEAKER_00]: were kind of tossed out and a bunch of
them survived and they kind of enter bread
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Guatemalans and they have a rich
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in that area, um, I saw a lot
of, uh, really unique narrow leaf types
[SPEAKER_00]: that were distinct from like Colombians or
the other Mexicans, you know, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: under an eradication at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to get it because it was
kind of a stronghold for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I would say part,
you know, part Davis, I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely Columbus, even captains,
you know, they needed to grow stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: they could also make sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had to get their butts out of
these places that they sailed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you sail from Europe or Spain,
you come all the way here, maybe you lose
[SPEAKER_00]: a sail or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to grow your hemp
back sales, but I've seen books too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a Mark Millen book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where there's eyewitness
accounts in the Midwest of people seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: large stands of hemp or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to, you know,
then if you want to go way back,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the, you know, the mummy that they
did the drug testing on, uh, it was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: controversy for a while, but they had a
mummy from Egypt and they thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's just check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's test it for drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, this is the mummy had like
cocaine, uh, nicotine, cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: had all these things showing up stuff that
they didn't really have in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's definitely a time where
there was a lot more trade than we know
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Columbus was probably one of
the last people to get here, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with these Olmec heads,
there's, there's such this ancient history
[SPEAKER_00]: that now we're kind of starting to get an
inkling of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're starting to open up these
new sites, like Gobekli Tepli and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these Indonesian, there's definitely a
high culture that existed before our
[SPEAKER_00]: current understanding, our current
literature, maybe pre-flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that the whole planet was
turned on in a way that there was a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the stuff that we see these
days is definitely, uh, diasporic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it came from people coming from their
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bringing their things similar to how,
uh, there's a big Indian population in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica and they brought a lot of their
strains from India into Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of Jamaican strains are actually
acclimatized Indians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of my gist on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you know, we don't still know
enough, you know, and, and time and
[SPEAKER_00]: environment does amazing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: When in Rome, we've got, another great
Patreon question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear Bodhi's thoughts on
Graham Hancock, Billy Carson, ancient
[SPEAKER_01]: civilizations, extraterrestrials,
all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, how do you control,
uh, you know, the society by controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: history, by controlling information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so much more that's
happened that's going on that they,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's very restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, I think there's,
some kind of system set up to keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: narrative, um, so that we are less
empowered as humans and as people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was this high, high time,
that's not a good thing to let out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: population that we're like this,
this dumb kind of like, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: leftover society, uh, that came out of a
higher society.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they're saying that at one
point in Egypt, a lot of the knowledge was
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that were living there,
really didn't have so much of a clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just kind of running off of
older paradigms that there was actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher time in Egypt that a lot of these,
uh, these, you know, pyramids,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different things, uh,
uh, geology, all the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: terraforming, all these things were being
done at a level that we no longer have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same in, you know, you have in South
America with the Nazca lines and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: pyramids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely, there's, uh,
there was a high culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty obvious to people that
want to dive into it that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much more to history that we
don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much more to our story and
there's so much more to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, we're a product of something
so, so complex and magnificent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, until we kind of realize that,
until we find these clues to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: awaken us out of this kind of collectics,
collective slumber of informational,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, servitude in prison, it's like,
we're not really going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: engage with the future because we can
really create what we want by learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, learning from the past to create
a better future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if our past is controlled,
we're, we're going to just be doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same old thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Graham Hawke Hancock is right on,
uh, Billy Carson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's a little more trippy and I love
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many of these guys,
you know, and you know, it's funny is like
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube, um, you can go around and
check out different things and I see some
[SPEAKER_00]: wild stuff and I have to just suspend
belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the strangest planet I've ever
been on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no clue what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these like soccer moms who are
like, who are like channeling the Ashtar
[SPEAKER_00]: command or Pleiadians or like,
you know, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: come join our Pleiadian mother circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's so, there's so much
wild stuff going on right now that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not, I can't say what's wrong and what's
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if this is simulation,
and whatever you want to do is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, be who you want to be and just dig,
get into whatever you're into and just
[SPEAKER_00]: make this an ecstatic, uh, place of like
loving, compassion, fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, make this the place
where people come from other systems to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how we get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this, you know, this is earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have a spotty past, but we're
getting, we're getting things sorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're, we turn this place back into
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it was the garden at one
point and through bad choices and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: people with messianic complexes,
you know, I mean, look at the Aztecs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were jamming and then they just
started to do way too many mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_00]: way too many sacrifices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they tapped into like some
kind of deionic kind of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the psychedelic space,
it's, it's like, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown Kingston or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's loads of cool people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also, you got to watch
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things they're willing to
take, you know, for, take you for your
[SPEAKER_00]: money or take you for someone in a
psychedelic situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that, you know, you have to
navigate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be kind of this warrior of
love when you go in, because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with the Aztecs, you know,
they think, I think they lost the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were tapping into something
that needed blood and it, instead of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with Quetzalcoatl, I think he
eventually came about and he decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop human sacrifice and they sacrificed
flowers and butterflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, on which side of history you
want to be, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that was a little bit of a
tangent, but that's the basic kind of my
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophy on it is, yeah, there's a lot
that, that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot that we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the past is the key to the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the golden line from in there,
this is the strangest planet I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: been on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to agree for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but can I interject something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just realized if people want to really
have fun, did you ever see like the
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient aliens, but the action Bronson
versions where they all get stoned and
[SPEAKER_00]: they watch ancient aliens and comment on
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to get like, I love crazy
stuff like that, but when you just throw
[SPEAKER_00]: super stoned guys into the mix,
like that is a classic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've ever seen that,
but I thought that was one of the funniest
[SPEAKER_00]: things ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, it's on the list now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like five or 10 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they watch, they literally watch the
best ancient aliens and they commentary on
[SPEAKER_00]: it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they getting super blazed?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got something I can watch in bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, on that theme at the end,
you were talking about doing too many
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we scale it back a bit, one of the
first questions I asked you answered and
[SPEAKER_01]: saying you were waiting for your medium to
grow some mushrooms, I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask, what are you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cubensis, anything more exotic and what do
you like doing with the medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually gone to the gym one time and
it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'd say do it every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like when the microdose accidentally
is a macrodose and you don't realize it
[SPEAKER_00]: till you pump an iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in my past, I grew a long,
long time ago mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it just, when I was
doing cannabis, it's like, I had to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I, there's things like,
I don't really own guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like anti gun or anything,
but there's certain things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be doing when you're growing a
lot of ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is growing other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back then, mushrooms was a big,
big no-no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you shouldn't have firearms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have money counters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that as a peaceful plant,
as a person, you know, pumping out a very
[SPEAKER_00]: sketchy crop in an urban landscape,
you don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a big, long hiatus until COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was in an area in which
it was sanctioned, you know, in Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_00]: County, you could grow mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I had some friends in high
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did, you know, I hadn't been
exposed to some of the mutants at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were getting into just like some of
the newer stuff like the albinos and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think this next round is just
going to be, I'm trying out kind of like I
[SPEAKER_00]: did when I was young and growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying out some of the hot new
strains, you know, I'm doing like an
[SPEAKER_00]: albino bluey baton, doing these like
Snape, like starry, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Starry night apes, like some of the,
uh, shock D's and a couple of the like
[SPEAKER_00]: more of whatever land racy ones,
you know, because I used to also collect,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, spore prints, you know, I collect
spore prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Terai of Nepal, down in the
jungles, uh, you know, in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties, early nineties, we did a whole,
um, me and my, uh, friend Mike did this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole adventure where we followed the
footsteps of like our garden was on,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went up into the Sierra Mazatec and
looked for Salvia and we got to meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sabina's and we did a lot of mushroom work
up there with the different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm super into, I love mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love medicinal mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love everything about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I don't know if it's too
cold up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'm just, maybe I got some bad,
uh, or just really slow culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, I'm waiting for my, my spawn or
substrate to colonize so that I can fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this doesn't work out, I might just
re colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's going right now, I think that
I'm waiting on is I'm doing some albino
[SPEAKER_00]: tidal waves and just some regular old
stuff, like some classics from the last
[SPEAKER_00]: year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, albino bluey baton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds a really cool and also exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the Zaza of mushrooms by the
sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even so exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, we're not going into the super
mutant zone, which is what fascinates me
[SPEAKER_00]: and which kind of seems to be driving a
lot of the, uh, mushroom culture right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how, you know, like there's like,
uh, some amazing people that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this, like eight King Kong and all the
people like that are also kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: connected in our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so many people are just really pushing
this and, you know, even the breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: their scientific breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's people that just mashing
up stuff and test tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just praying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with, uh, fetal selection is
primarily driven, you know, on output and
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and, and, uh, um, even canopy and
perfect fruits, but there's a whole genre
[SPEAKER_00]: that people just searching for mutants and
just the most amazing thing, things that
[SPEAKER_00]: look like lettuce, string cheese,
Swiss cheese, like brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have incredible potency and
they, you know, and with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a whole realm of,
uh, of, uh, you know, people concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: on psilocybin, psilocin, and Bay assistant
and all these, you know, general
[SPEAKER_00]: tryptamines, but there's a whole,
I think there's a lot of other tryptamines
[SPEAKER_00]: in some of these varieties that they
haven't really measured for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives them their kind of
individual effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just such a fascinating,
fascinating world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've also been getting really,
uh, back into cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always really been in the cactus,
but now I never really popped cactus seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because they take forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fun cactus, but it's like,
you got to start the year before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but you sprout so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year you've got like
little 12 inch cactuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I just love planting seeds of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I flip out when that Baker Creek
seed company catalog comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with all the hybrid strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I especially like the ones that
are getting them from like, they'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little section with new African sessions,
like basils from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I love when I was in Santa Cruz,
I love the Japanese stuff because all the
[SPEAKER_00]: little Japanese islands are kind of like
the same general environment at Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz, kind of hot in the summer,
but kind of balmy and a little bit too
[SPEAKER_00]: humid, but coastal environment with trees
and getting all the weird greens and
[SPEAKER_00]: eggplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just go nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love plants and I love seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I don't even care if they
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so mushrooms, spores, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spores are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can, they're one of the only things
that can go through space travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I learned that, like, you know,
how cool is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That spores survive space travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I had a whole weird trip
where I was like, oh my gosh, what if
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom spores are terraforming
technologies from the source?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like blown out through
space-time hitting inhabitable planets and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding those planets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause with, you know, cause there are
these little mini like starships that have
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA of fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fungus is one of the very first
terraformers of these planets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I love your theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure it's not my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are many trippers have done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Paul Stametser, all these people,
it's pretty self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why would spores be able to move
through space flight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, why not have something
that quickens the monkey mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the whole Terrence McKenna,
the stoned ape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I totally believe plants are the
reason why we are who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, and, and definitely
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think the spirit plants are what
kind of taught us to communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even heard something really crazy
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's true, but I heard
that every, but before this one famous
[SPEAKER_00]: alchemist, uh, everybody read books in
their, uh, out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one read books in their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody who would read to,
would always read to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it was in their room or to
other people, and it really tripped us
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like maybe five or 600
years ago, there was a certain alchemist
[SPEAKER_00]: who could read in his mouth, like
basically how we all do it, just read to
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really threw everybody for a loop
because they're like, what's this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does he remember all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just cause he was reading his
mind, total tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just, that popped in my head because
I thought it was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people started to be like,
Oh, well, you don't have to read with your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read inside your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that set off a, you know, whole nother
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe, you know, they used to do a lot
of, uh, hashish was a commodity that moved
[SPEAKER_00]: through time and space a lot more
lucratively than we ever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ever thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it had a, it had a trajectory of its
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it, you know, I mean, of course we
all know about the Silk Row and how things
[SPEAKER_00]: traveled along that, but there was hashish
getting into Europe and to the alchemists
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually all over, you know,
the Mediterranean everywhere quite early
[SPEAKER_00]: on, it was a coveted substance along with,
you know, opium and I'm sure many other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we just don't have a
historical record of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of that stuff is so,
so interesting, like especially all the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the history of the Silk Road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you said, the stuff we don't have
the history of is probably the most
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting of it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while we're on the topic, what are
your thoughts on like modern hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I guess like the Rosen scene,
the, the BHC and all the variants,
[SPEAKER_01]: where do you, where do you feel we're at
with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I think it's just coming into
its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with this, they even have like the
pay a telling now there's all these
[SPEAKER_00]: natural technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, fresh frozen,
then pressing out, like people are finding
[SPEAKER_00]: like it is, it's a modern day alchemical
revolution, you know, in the processing
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, like it's basically people
just getting to tweak out as hard as they
[SPEAKER_00]: can to create the most, you know,
the, the most fabulous item, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: most, you know, everybody, I think it's
like, what a noble pursuit to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: most fabulous, like representation of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's gift is its head, you know,
it's, it's like, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people doing everything I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, BHO was our like, kind of like a
MacGyver level, just getting to know that,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving into like bubble hash and
then, and then to Frenchie and bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: back, you know, his whole bringing back
the old school ways, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's so much to learn from the
old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just apply it, you know,
people are now like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of cultures would harvest and hang
into the winter so that when they did
[SPEAKER_00]: their processing, it was super cold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They preserve heads, you know,
burying things like some of the Afghans,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would bury it in, you know,
like the stomach of a sheep or sheep skin
[SPEAKER_00]: or do these different processing
techniques and hand, hand rubbing is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thing on its own and having kids hand rub
because they're such, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: delicate, there's so many ways that we're
taking to this future, but this new
[SPEAKER_00]: current like, uh, machinery meets,
you know, like pressing meets,
[SPEAKER_00]: sieving meets, all these instruction
technologies, and then everybody getting
[SPEAKER_00]: so into it and like, you know,
things like the ego clash and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of funny that it's always the
same strain, like Skittles winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that would be a, they,
people would be pushing it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, new directions with flavors,
but I think it's kind of like everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to win and Skittles is always
winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why, yeah, who wants to deviate from
the winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it's like, if you have a
winning hamster breed, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be breeding like a hairless hamster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something thinking it's super cool to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I'm saying is I think
this new hash revolution is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as the, the PIP con same as,
uh, just all these new avenues that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are really finding and finding their,
their path in it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, I say, yeah, kudos, gung ho,
you guys get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I'm all aboard and I, I'm
interested to see what it will look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a, as a more general question,
like where do you see the cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_01]: going in like five to 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think the landscape will look
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will we, will we still be consuming flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you, I think we'll always be
consuming flour because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are just doing what they can
to get by and use cannabis just to make
[SPEAKER_00]: their end of their day better,
to help with those aches and pains,
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay up and stay anti-depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to, uh, to get more into their music,
their hobbies, their video games,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's always going to be flour
because it's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, people love flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, isn't that, um, uh, uh,
Luther, one of the Luther birth banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: like quotes, like nature laughs and
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just this, it's a special thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in five years, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it depends on legislation too,
or how things open up and how creative
[SPEAKER_00]: people can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, it can be very dystopian
with just fake turps and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, distill it and people mix it into
creepy carts and getting them out as every
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's always going to be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know kids like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were talking, that's about the
spray packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I would like to see is just
total freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can do is people get into how they
want to do it and just come up with every
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginable, really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the best toys always rise to
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like people are going to
make more and more unique things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more novelty and uniqueness,
the more, uh, the public's going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: it and the more it's going to bolster it
and the more it's going to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to see a dystopian future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see like a future that has like
infinite cannabis potentials and enough
[SPEAKER_00]: potential so that everybody has a way to
provide for themselves, but also nourish
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to get into cannabis and
plants and stuff that they can support
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and their family and find their
niche and find their passion and create
[SPEAKER_00]: something unique and new, whether it's
just making really good bubble hash from a
[SPEAKER_00]: really special strain that maybe their
family has only had to some kind of wizard
[SPEAKER_00]: level, like Ross and pay a tele like,
um, uh, you know, 31 flavor swirl unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: like just, just getting so uniquely
amazing, you know, static tech,
[SPEAKER_00]: superhero.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know, just people going for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I really want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping not to see pharmaceutical
companies and big grow ops, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: just gross mids, uh, you know,
massive company grow offs and people
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing up fistulate, um, funky carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see people following their heart
and bliss and making this a really unique
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that takes people like getting the
middle finger to government, big business,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe deciding that flowers shouldn't
be illegal and breaking some laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe it's time to break some laws,
especially laws that are dumb and have
[SPEAKER_00]: only been around since, you know,
the prohibition days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is where I just like, especially like
putting people, people in cages for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or selling flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where, where did that like,
who is involved in that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably one of the most insane
myopic and dumb things I've ever like can
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap my brain around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I want people to just do,
do the impossible and do it from their
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that because I, I can't
remember who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I spoke to him and I sort of said,
look, you know, people have criticized
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the things you've advocated for,
um, like legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sort of said, you know,
look at the end of the day though,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the ultimate metric is like people
kept out of jail for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as much as it's not great,
like, you know, you, it's gotta be the
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimate metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, it is, that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that topic, you know, I got two,
two questions for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is, you know, you,
you spoke about moving forward some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners had taken a look at some of the
new lavender lemonade lines or hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted to know firstly,
are there any you're particularly excited
[SPEAKER_01]: for?
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a quick followup, one of the
listeners says, look, there's some cool
[SPEAKER_01]: looking new moms in the mix that I hadn't
really heard of, you know, like chai and
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen lemons and dessert lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about some of
those moms and are there any you're really
[SPEAKER_01]: keen about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like a lot of those ones are ones
that I got from, um, from Hayes Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: like ones that they really liked and real,
and they really dug, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when I, uh, and when I didn't have a
grow and I was, uh, you know, I made it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I needed help making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, you know, it's a long story,
but they were made in a place that,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I won't get into it, but they
helped, um, make a round of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, uh, they had so many unique
cultivars to choose from that I threw in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of theirs as well as mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because you know, I got to experience
from a flower and I think, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I always love to see what people are
doing and what all the new neat things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people are awesome and cannabis is
awesome and cool stuff gets made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy to like, especially when
you're kind of hermetic like me to really
[SPEAKER_00]: get a chance to see all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I threw in some of the ones I liked,
you know, and there's also a lot of ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that were just stuff that I never
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like chai is actually a, um, ass F three
that I just pushed the ass more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the kind of like, um, the,
I think it was a hells angels in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, there's a little bit of
hells angels in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I like to take a lot of my lines
and push them in different directions and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of use them as tools or have them for
a rainy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't usually release them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, when you're doing,
uh, you're pushing lines and you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: F gens, you're usually kind of just doing
them for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're, maybe you're just pollinating
a small plant or your pollinated branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, the chai is part of that
Mandarin orange spice, uh, line that was
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa to lavender lemonade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that isn't almost a plant that was
reminding me of kind of like the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really creamy and just the tiniest
bit spicy, but mostly just kind of very
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty and monotone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew in a hybrid, if you searched
hard enough, that skunk stuff might come
[SPEAKER_00]: back out because it's only like a cross
away from just, you know, popping its head
[SPEAKER_00]: back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in the Mandarin orange spice,
you'll find once in a while you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: really gross kind of like ass throwback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you usually get kind of like this hoppy
orange, Pico T really beautiful flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good producer, really thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but once in a while you get a stinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to look for in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I mean, that's the gist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of some of the other
ones I threw in and I threw in some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: other, like, you know, I used to test out
a lot of things at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would always find cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I didn't have any seeds so much
to release, but I would keep them around
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, I'd throw them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was kind of fun because
it wasn't a traditional breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, kind of event where I would take a,
you know, a medium size room and put in
[SPEAKER_00]: all my favorites and just let one of my
standards kind of just do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the HG 13 or Wookie or Appalachia,
Snow Lotus, any of those bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: populations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these new things are either
special things from other people or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of special things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I collected over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look on the topic of special things
you've collected over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our listeners says that they were
lucky enough to score themselves a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Acapulco gold freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are, they just wanted to know a
little bit of backstory on these ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm pretty positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I always get everybody, especially
back in the old days, everybody's handles
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost positive that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, that wasn't from liquid kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry if it was from someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those came from his mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what was his winter's name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like black wolf or dire wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a really cool, like old schoolers
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I w I'm such, I wish I wrote I'm
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this all written down, but my
memory is just not the way it used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: even a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was his mentors that he got in
Acapulco a long time ago and he'd saved
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, I got him from liquid kid
and they were so cool that, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I decided, Oh, this is an awesome
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a repro and try and save
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually a gentleman that I
knew that was such a good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually did, I sent him to him because
he's like, Oh, I've always wanted an
[SPEAKER_00]: Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, he saw that I was growing
them and, and why is his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you're living on through the
strains here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a story to every strain in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's beautiful that maybe I'll post it
somewhere when I can get all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he always wanted to go and Acapulco
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, I only have a
few seeds, but if you, if you do an open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination and you give me back a bunch
for the Nureka project, um, you're welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: to have these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he grew out a bunch and he did a great
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had, he grew them around his pool,
like in, uh, Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did, he had a, I think a couple of
males and he had about eight females and
[SPEAKER_00]: he kept a bunch for himself and he sent
that me the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, one of the lines was
slightly her and mafridic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't put those into the mix and put them
into packs and gave out tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in Nureka, I think sold some
through Nureka, um, the Nureka project,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mostly just gave them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, it's beautiful to see
people getting back into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like mass medical, he didn't,
he did a, a repro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think a few other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's, that's where I think a
lot of these cool people want these old
[SPEAKER_00]: school standards is find the old growers,
find the old people that have had these
[SPEAKER_00]: lines forever because you know,
it's a snapshot in time, in time and space
[SPEAKER_00]: and environment that we don't really have
the opportunity to, uh, have anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like these, these are
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Polaroid of your, uh,
uh, you know, you're an old family member
[SPEAKER_00]: and Acapulco, you know, get to see him in
their teenage years, all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's, these are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snapshots, like these time machines,
like, and they're interactive too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is not only a seed,
this is an interactive time machine for,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a special time in history,
a special geographic location history and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that came before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you dig, if you go deep enough
into these strains, like really open up to
[SPEAKER_00]: them and just, especially if you just get
a mega blaze going on and deep dive,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can follow these strains back into
almost to back to their very origin and
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, and you'll get these little,
sometimes imprints of people and cultures
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe it's just tripping out and
having fun with your mind, but it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: as real as anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I know that once again,
I'm going, tangifying on just that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but big ups to all these people that have
brought these old seeds into my life and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the Acapulco world,
cool, cool strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's the backstory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't heard any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dire wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shut up, but it, it's, it's not,
it's something like that, but you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: gist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the gist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then talking about older seeds,
you know, um, another good question we got
[SPEAKER_01]: was in your opinion, you know,
do you think cannabis was really that
[SPEAKER_01]: different in the early nineties or is it,
you know, a bit of nostalgia about old
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it was both, you know,
I think we're getting a lot of import back
[SPEAKER_00]: then and anything grown point of origin
that has the right arc of the sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right soil composition, the right,
uh, all these parameters, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these strains kind of grew in these
locations and were tended by humans in
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially the ones that we're picking
for drug types, you know, a drug type
[SPEAKER_00]: selected over a hundred year span in a
certain location with everything it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to express itself to its highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's getting imported, you know,
and a lot of these narrow leafs do better
[SPEAKER_00]: when they have time to age or practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're coming into the States and
you're getting tie stick or you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a totally different and amazing
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be the same thing as maybe going
to Thailand now and trying some kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a tie stick or something at
their point of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think there's something to
experiencing these heirloom and so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: like land race streams at their point of
origin, because that's where they truly
[SPEAKER_00]: shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try and acclimatize them here and
we get, or we can try and replicate in
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, and we can get pretty close,
but we never really get the true,
[SPEAKER_00]: true, like it's like, you know,
and it's a native element, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think hybrids are so cool
as these are kind of like these futuristic
[SPEAKER_00]: creations that have, um, um, a little bit
of everything that are unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I talked to, like I was
saying, Jeff from Jane nectar,
[SPEAKER_00]: he smoked my, um, uh, space nectar,
which is like a blue dream Wookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's used to smoking heirlooms all,
you know, all the time and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things from all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, wow, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really got, it's really introspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had all these qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, this is welcome
to the world of hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like you sometimes it's
just like people that never smoke heirloom
[SPEAKER_00]: or land race that has a very specific kind
of morphology and cannabinoid spectrum and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never smoked those, you never
really have get to experience the
[SPEAKER_00]: specialness of kind of other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think he, it was kind of an aha
moment, at least for me and probably for
[SPEAKER_00]: him too, that, wow, hybrids also have this
really special magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really this unique blending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that was kind of, I don't know if
I got too off talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's how I feel about,
um, yeah, these, these, I do think there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a big difference back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, and maybe it wasn't as
potent or maybe we didn't have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of variety and spectrum,
but we had these really distinct,
[SPEAKER_00]: and unique cultivars that were shaped over
long periods of time with the hands of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, many, I would say many green
hands, like many hands shape these many
[SPEAKER_00]: nights, many days, many full moons,
many rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have like a really, they have a
personality, whereas the new hybrids are
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy groovy, like hyped up kids that
kind of can, you know, especially in this
[SPEAKER_00]: day and age with the internet,
we have influences from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have kids in, uh,
in the highest towns of like Bolivia
[SPEAKER_00]: making super dope crazy, like electro
cumbia or like moon baton or like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, trans baton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have all these new like
combinations of music because people can
[SPEAKER_00]: do what their old PC can download these
programs on like, you know, like dark web
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever someplace, get it for free or
from a friend or, and make a crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: unique, amazing things that, that are
really true to their generation into
[SPEAKER_00]: their, cause we're kind of like,
you know, as a culture and as a society,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not these like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you could say, oh, you're Indian,
you're African, you're this, we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: like a global, you know, if you strip down
the melanin, you strip down, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, body hair, whatever else that
makes people different races or cultures,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really a like global human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in cannabis, it's kind of what
we're experiencing now and as well as with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else that we can be creative
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer the question, yeah,
I think it was special and different and
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, the good thing is we now we have
this new thing and if we're smart and if
[SPEAKER_00]: we really look to our elders and if we
really try not to lose these things and
[SPEAKER_00]: also keep these places that still hold
these things clean and, and well,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, nourished, I think we can have the
best of the both worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best of both worlds sounds like
exactly what we want really.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess as a followup to that,
you know, talking about memorable
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, a really good question was,
what's a plant that has just really held a
[SPEAKER_01]: spot in your mind over the years and what
was it that made it so memorable?
Let me think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've always liked Stevie Wonder,
mostly just cause it was a snapshot of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the like hypers things of like,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago or something, you know,
it was like a, it was a Sensi star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was a blueberry Bubba Kush Sensi
star train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was just the ultimate mash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of my earliest kind of creative
creations and it's still like the only
[SPEAKER_00]: clone I hold from when I very first
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the old ones, we had one
called Cohiba, which was like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it came out of my deep funk line that used
a long time ago was called biodiesel
[SPEAKER_00]: before, um, you kind of drop, uh,
before I just switched it back to deep
[SPEAKER_00]: funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was this, it was a rez sour
diesel, IBL deep chunk cross, and it had
[SPEAKER_00]: the most insane F1 vigor you'd ever seen a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I guess cause deep chunk is so
inbred, you know, rez did a good job of
[SPEAKER_00]: really pushing those SD lines way down the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it, it was the coolest plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just jet black with this beautiful
milky white trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just huge and amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it made these big cushy nugs
and it smelled just like Cohiba cigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like uncanny and weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just had a really kind of like,
I just felt like Che Guevara or something
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it, you know, it just really had
this vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: To it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, you know, I think we lost that one
maybe six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some seeds to kind of go
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was always a cool, I'm trying to
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Eve, this kind of goes back to
when asked before, like, what are my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was a little dumbstruck when you
asked me, because I was like, I realized,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, I probably have 500 release
strains or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, maybe five times that just
in the fridge unreleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was coming to terms now and I'm
like, I should have said like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's ones that I really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't even say mother's milk,
which I think is such an amazing strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the turps and just the feeling like
it's just such a warm hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like high, you know, temple was one that I
just so loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was one of my kind of very first
successful kind of narrow leaf style,
[SPEAKER_00]: like sativa highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and it was so joyous and laughy and
fun and it grew so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like that perfect Williams
wonder super silver haze kind of combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I think about all those
stashes, I made Boba stash, Lando stash,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of like the bounty hunter series with
all the old LA Kush cuts, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the good medicine I love so much
because that was just, I started that just
[SPEAKER_00]: when they were learning how to test for
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when I kind of, that was
where I got a little scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really trying to create a CBD
breeding male back when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was, I don't even know that was when
SC lab was first open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was actually testing my males and
I think that was my kind of my first
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction to science to make outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been so many plants too,
that just kind of come up in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that we call Gracious Madre
that still comes up to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had those most amazing last time
that it happened a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had one called Gracious Madre and it
was this, I think it was like a lauation
[SPEAKER_00]: A1 or something, but it literally was
like, it's spot on that China church
[SPEAKER_00]: incense in the air smell, like just
classic kind of when people think of that
[SPEAKER_00]: piffy kind of mirror lights haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping still that Radio Ridge has it,
but you know, they're super diligent on
[SPEAKER_00]: the hot plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they test everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it even anything's hot,
they instantly smoke it, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully it's still alive and it
didn't reach that fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, you know what was one that
was really cool that I don't really talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this one I made really early on
when I was still selling seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: like on seed bay was that we called it the
PKBKSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a sour diesel Bubba Kush crossed to
purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of the San Francisco super
mashup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave that to a friend who moved back
to Israel before legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started that one of the first
companies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became the most, smoked grown and
medical cannabis in all of Israel for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, for like years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the number one seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, we just call it PKBKSD because
it was purple Kush, Bubba Kush sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of took on, that's one of the
strains that kind of took a life of its
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows what's going on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they still have it, but so those
are kind of some of the ones that got away
[SPEAKER_00]: or that I really, you know, that I have a
deep connection to that I kind of forget,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and even some, I love to do like
remixes, like switch the mothers and
[SPEAKER_00]: fathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the remixes are better than
the releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been some really cool releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that even some of the Girl Scout
cookies remixes where I used the,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, OG KB instead of the, you know,
thin man or cookies cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those came out sometimes way better than
the cookies ones because they were so
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of my take on that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a shout out to Tranquil Elephantizer
remix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that bad boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the first strains I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That just reminds me, I was thinking,
people always ask me like, what's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: air?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start out on something that's
like an heirloom or a land race or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, whatever you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, there's a few strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if anyone just wants to start
easy, grow, you super unique, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: really great highs and just special,
like, you know, the Pakistani chitra kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, I think everybody's pretty
much released it like ACE and Charlie and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one in Spain, like it came
through Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to have green phenos too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phenomenal line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that's made its way out is
that Bear Frogs cashmere azad that I use
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of those probe series,
you know, the cashmere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's such a cool combination of like
low land and high land, like coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it has some of the traits
of that, you know, kind of like Himalayan
[SPEAKER_00]: style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a Karakom and it's in the
Pakistani kind of cashmere area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such an amazing, like you can tell it's
kind of like, it has a little bit of low
[SPEAKER_00]: land, kind of that kind of cushy,
quick, special, magical, like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvestable and that's kind of high
Himalayan, like narrow leaf space age,
[SPEAKER_00]: like beauty realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anybody ask me, those are two great
ones to kind of start in on if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: more narrow leaf, you know, if you want
broad leaf, there's infinite unique ones
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of try these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, sorry for going off on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to throw that in there before
I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to throw it in before you
forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works out perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're telepathically connected through the
zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have asked this earlier,
but this one's from a good buddy of mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I've got to make sure I do him justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he's actually going to be doing a
trek in Nepal next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said he'd heard you'd been to the
I'm going to butcher the pronunciation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll try Manaslu and the Sum Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are areas that's kind of in
between like Langtang and Annapurna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a little more west.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that's probably a really cool
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, there's places where a lot
of the tracks kind of focus in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I think that and,
you know, Everest before Bank before the
[SPEAKER_00]: base camp, a lot of people fly into base
camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really do the whole Everest
track like that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then farther west near Sakeem is I
mean, sorry, farther east or Sakeem is
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then farther west, west where kind of
where the communists, the Maoists were for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while is a really cool areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that Manaslu area, I think
that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of in between Langtang and
Annapurna.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a really killer
place to kind of check out because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: even more off the beaten track,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, it sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a quick follow up question,
which was, are you able to elaborate on
[SPEAKER_01]: your Lao or Nepali adventures?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've done so in the past,
so feel free to just say refer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But any specific sort of locations in
Nepal you think are like a must for people
[SPEAKER_01]: who go there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know there's I mean, if people
want a little insider tip, like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go like where there's like the
super like wizardy like ganja guy that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can pick up stuff on the trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the authorities in Nepal aren't
listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chitri, which is on the Annapurna circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going down towards the I believe
it's toward the hot springs on your left,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a it just looks like a groovy
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe ask people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy that literally has the best
buds from all over the area and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: knows everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chitri is kind of special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I found a lot of really cool things
just growing out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, some towns are just
groovier than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's because this guy kind of
had an influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a dude in Chitri that has
great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Annapurna circuit is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a little bit overrun these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think they've ran and now they
have a bus line that goes all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through, which is a total shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Langtang is still a bit wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little jungly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the far west might have some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a lot of commercial
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like get down into the lowlands too,
like the Turai, like Bardia and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Chitwan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like on the jungly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's jungly areas that have the
rhinos and the, you know, the elephants
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the crazy tall grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some really cool narrowleaf
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really cool place to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, even just Kathmandu,
meet people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try a lot of different head rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try a lot of different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for, you know, the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, even I think up near
Dokshin Kali, which is a famous Kali
[SPEAKER_00]: temple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of really kind of
tucked back ganja growing back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you sometimes you'll meet cool people
that are just kind of expatriates or
[SPEAKER_00]: people that live in Nepal and really pick
their brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them out for some tea or just take
them out for a sizzler.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them like, it's this kind of
like a, it's like Nepali fajitas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make friends and like really check out
where these places are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on the trail, I'm not saying
child labor is cool, but these are ancient
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like kids are usually just to make extra
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids are rubbing up a storm and just
hitting the trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so many times I'd be walking along
and this little kid would kind of roll up
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, hey, and I knew, I'm like,
okay, this kid just rubbed some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to sell it to me to get some
candy or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you sometimes should get really good
kid a hand rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Nepal's a great direct from the
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so, and you can go with your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I would say that,
you know, Sikkim is another kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in India, but it's right near Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little less off, you know,
it's more off the beaten track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have a lot of really cool
stuff and then, you know, that's a great,
[SPEAKER_00]: great area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Himalayas are just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just get out there and talk to
people, find some cool spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see the guy in Chichri that looks
a little bit stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, give them, you know,
talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone needs to stash that away in a
part of their brain and use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of like the top five most psychedelic
plants I've ever tried were from you with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what's the most psychedelic
plant you've ever had, or at least in your
[SPEAKER_01]: memory that jumps to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it has to be kind of like point of
origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in Oaxaca, when we were up in
the mountains with the Sabina family and
[SPEAKER_00]: working up there and with the Casamures,
the other big mushroom family,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was this guy who went, who kind of
was a heroin addict and he moved to Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he became, I don't know if it's a
story before, but he became like,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was a beekeeper and he came down and
they didn't really have the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: beekeeping vibe going up in those
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of became this teacher of the
bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would follow all around and he
would teach beekeeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really turned people, a lot of
these tribal peoples, they're Mazatec onto
[SPEAKER_00]: beekeeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone loved him and he used to have
like this, he had the best stash ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to try some of his Oaxacan gold
and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I've never experienced
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably one of the most
psychedelic kind of like true psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: was a really good Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've never been to Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been to Peru and Bolivia and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never got to try like real Santa
Marta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried Colombians here and
I've tried hybrids and they're such an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, you can really tell the
difference in the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I'm trying to think where
else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time ago, I was on Copangon,
you know, place where they have the big
[SPEAKER_00]: full moon parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was staying in the old Osho commune
that they turned into bungalows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I befriended a guy and I got,
he got me a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the, that was part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 25 years ago, this most this,
but I didn't even know what I thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, it was like a piece of lint that
got stuck in marshmallows or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this, it like stuck to the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like had to peel the bag off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like in some like plastic wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the most insanely sticky thing I
ever got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember going out under the moon in
front of my bungalow and just floating in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water and just having the most like
epic just like, you know, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you smoke and it's, it was
almost like a deprivation chamber with the
[SPEAKER_00]: moon above me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like, I got a download, you know,
when you just, it's like, oh, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something in creation or just sometime in
your life where the source is just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, it's time to download those
codes, get ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, you know,
here's your next assignment or whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember getting like a super
download from this tie that I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: where he got it on the island or what it
was, but it was like, and that's when I
[SPEAKER_00]: think people talk about like, I never
really had super tie experiences,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in Thailand, we don't always get the
best stuff, but that was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was like, oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what real tie when people talk
about like tie, like that was what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad to hear that you had that
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm, I'm sure it was just as
epic as you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and hopefully everyone else out there
can relate in their own way, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you just saying that I was sort of
thinking to myself of a similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: different, but similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I wanted us to do before
we wrap up was a touch back on our book
[SPEAKER_01]: club theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear, what do you have for
recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked me cause I, yeah, same time I
was a little bit like, I got a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: stumped because you know, when my,
my mind, I don't know if I'm on the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum or what, but when someone asks me
something, my mind goes like into every
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginable like scenario and it doesn't
always have the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it shoots my consciousness into
every possible thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, but that doesn't mean my
consciousness has enough really to grasp
[SPEAKER_00]: it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like this thing where I kind of
go in and, and, and it, and I kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: into everything and then I try and bring
it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a little bit, uh, bam,
like, uh, where they got bedazzled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of, this time I'm going to be
like, I kind of, I'm going to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I kind of feel like are some really
good resources for people, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so like I'm always super, like these
are kind of like more breeding plant
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my Bible in high school was plants of
the gods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that is like anybody that wants a
cool book, like I know it's dated,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's old, it's a Albert Hoffman and
Richard Evans Schultes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that is like, that is like pretty
much one of my favorite books of all time
[SPEAKER_00]: as a, like a guide, you know, anything
Terrence McKenna, Terrence McKenna
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many, there's so much amazing
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the smartest, most amazing,
most eloquent humans as ever kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: walked the earth, you know, Luther
Burbank, such, such an amazing breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: such a cool guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really, um, Rudolf Steiner,
these, you know, these two guys are,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is like the pinnacle of like natural
science, like people that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're scientific in their
methodology, but they're working from
[SPEAKER_00]: their heart and they're working kind of
with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, they're not, it's not a control of
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a connection working with
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, any of like the psychedelic
guys at the botanist, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, like I said, Jonathan odd
and Christian Ratch and Plowman Wade
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis, Mark plot and like Richard M
Schultes, like these guys are just,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are kind of my, like who I look up
to, you know, and then for like religion,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm really influenced by like a
barefoot doctor style, Taoism and like
[SPEAKER_00]: super ancient, even, even kind of modern
stuff like Montauk, Chia, and just that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of watching being part of nature to
find, you know, they always say like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Terrence McKenna is like,
who's the greatest teacher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just nature, just go out on a walk
and just be attentive and aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I'm also really influenced
by, uh, uh, Buddhism and Hinduism,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially some of the more ancient forms
got kind of in the, it was kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: Odin Yonah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of not kind of, I guess a lot of
it came from this kind of Tigris,
[SPEAKER_00]: Euphrates kind of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an area that kind of spawned a
lot of the things that I like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Kashmir Shaivism and Zojen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of the authors I think
are super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for Buddhism, I like, uh,
I like Keith Dauman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Namakai Norbu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chagmin Tromka.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, you know, um, for Kashmir
Shaivism, I super dig like Swami Lakshman
[SPEAKER_00]: Juh.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just down to earth and super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love like Paul Mueller of Teigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Christopher Wallace.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really cool new guy that kind of,
that really kind of breaks down like some
[SPEAKER_00]: of Abhinav Gupta's teachings, which he was
like one of my kind of like, I really like
[SPEAKER_00]: what his, as the saints and these old
philosophers kind of like, he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of like people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Gorkhanath, who was kind of like an
ancient yogi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, who else is cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Mark Skitsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot for Kashmir Shaivism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Robert Slovata.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did like the Aghori books.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an Arivig doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I super dig like even old
sites like Irwin, you know, Schumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: Deivante, Nexus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you can get yourself a hold on
like some of the old Shaman drums
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines, those are super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all kinds of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and just podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, there's so much going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love YouTube now, but there's a lot of
like, I'll think I'll be watching
[SPEAKER_00]: something cool and then they get it all
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, you know, back when we
researched, like we didn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get like, we had to find books.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go look, you know, for these
things on ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was like really finding some of
this information when I was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: teenager and even a young man,
it was a treasure hunt and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like almost, cut the wheat from the
shaft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, because you would, if you met
someone and you guys could talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: things on the same level, you know,
that person really did their work,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they had parents that were into
her or they were, had you were,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they were super into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to libraries, they collected
books, like they were in places,
[SPEAKER_00]: points of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you really had to do your due
diligence to get this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when we were originally in the
Sierra Maztec looking for Salvia
[SPEAKER_00]: divinorum, that was before they realized
it was, um, it was buccal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only active, well, primarily active
beside smoking, uh, by a mucus membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were drinking shamrock shakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just drinking it right down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, we were told it's a very
feminine and beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't like fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very ancient magical,
uh, moisture feminine being that it
[SPEAKER_00]: really, when people smoke it, it kind of
turns on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we never knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went through my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole first Salvia phase, not even
really understanding how to utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back then, same with records,
you know, before CDJs and laptops,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had to find these records and they were
like magical spells and they would get
[SPEAKER_00]: beat up and we couldn't just re-download
them or we couldn't go to Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was such a treasure hunt back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of miss that these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what was so, I think what made
me so stoked on seed hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so analog like getting these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no, you know, I was like,
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I, as a DJ, everything turned to memory
sticks and firstly with CDJs then memory
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even thought long time ago, record
compilations were kind of cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's all just pretty much
computerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never, it's never, I mean,
maybe someday it'll be computerized with
[SPEAKER_00]: these new embryo seeds and all this,
but really it's one of the most epic
[SPEAKER_00]: treasure hunting tweak out trading card,
like natural, like I can imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 100,000 years ago, like full on
Chaka from land of the loss, like hooking
[SPEAKER_00]: up and trading seeds with his buddies,
a couple of valleys over, like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like seeds are, I know it's kind of a
pivot, but I love the treasure hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think seeds are an amazing way to
make friends and trade and dork out and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, sorry, that's a long one,
but that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree more with everything you
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the reading list, I got to give a
shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my biggest recommendations I give
to everyone all the time, still hooked on
[SPEAKER_01]: it, 10 out of 10, anything from Ram Dass,
but walking each other home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a big one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ram Dass is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what too?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't got to read so much of the new
science fiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I super dig fantasy and science fiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm always like, you know,
Tolkien and Herbert and all those,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know what's really cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn people onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an author that not a lot of people,
people know about is he's living.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of like obscure is AA Otanasio,
like such a cool, like he does fantasy and
[SPEAKER_00]: science fiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did like a whole trilogy that people
kind of know him for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was based on Arthurian legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really good, but his super dope
one is called Wyvern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in it, like the book Wyvern is like
one of my favorite books.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I also like Heinlein,
you know, Stranger and Stranger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like some of the sixties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of sci-fi too, like that kind of
seventies, groovy, freaky sci-fi,
[SPEAKER_00]: but AA Otanasio, if anyone ever want to
read Wyvern, that's a really cool book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to put it on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, I have not heard of that one,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, that just about brings us to
the end of it for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I wanted to ask anything we've
left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no, I mean, I think I,
I've always wanted to revise my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my, if I had a time machine, like where
would I go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say I've got a time machine for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go anywhere, any place,
anytime, presumably to collect some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I really thought about this and I
think I got really stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, where the hell do I want to
go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like if I had a time machine,
because you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a time machine, especially if
you, you know where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go to Afghanistan,
get yourself a heirloom Afghani,
[SPEAKER_00]: get super baked and just get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I was thinking about it before,
you know, I did the usual Silk Road kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of heyday, whatever, you know,
whatever seven, 1600, 1700.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking I would like to go back to
the whole kind of Eurasia areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the Mediterranean, about 400
BC, like around kind of around like Plato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to be like this super
elite, uh, back slinger for all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mediterranean, all those islands,
all those like really cool places and like
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little entourage and we all grew
like the most crazy stuff are picked it up
[SPEAKER_00]: in our travels from the seeds that,
you know, from the seeds that we got all
[SPEAKER_00]: over, we traded with like, you know,
the Mongol empire and we went to Egypt and
[SPEAKER_00]: we hooked them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were travelers and seed collectors
as young ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we grew older, we had all these
lines and we grew them in little farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just rolled through like,
and we took like a, maybe like six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started kind of maybe in Turkey or
maybe like even like Paris or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, Paris didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually that was kind of, I think that
was back in the Mithraric age or with
[SPEAKER_00]: Mithros and all these different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, let's start in the
Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would start our role in the
Mediterranean and all the Minoan,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this Crete and all the spaces and roll
all the way through to Egypt and then into
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like with the, just a whole crew,
which is the most epic plant, like just
[SPEAKER_00]: buds and hash and all the kings and
queens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody would always invite us
into their courts and offer the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, finest foods and courtesans and
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be like the highlight for
every main city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we rolled through, you know,
like our squad, there would be like songs
[SPEAKER_00]: sang and, and you know, all these,
and people would write these books and
[SPEAKER_00]: praises that, yes, the squad comes through
and brings the most epic mind boggling
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and strains and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and just a good time we would have
like, I think eventually it would be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a traveling road show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we would get like bards and
musicians from all the places,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the best musicians from all the
different cultures we went to and form
[SPEAKER_00]: like the super crazy, like, like Muppet,
like Electric Mayhem band with like people
[SPEAKER_00]: with instruments from China that were like
popular class and people from like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and just make this crazy metal
band or like just, and just have the most
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate like traveling road show of plant
medicine and ganja and music and delight
[SPEAKER_00]: and merriment and just bring them,
just keeping the vibe alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just getting, just, just going for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just having so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's, that's gotta be up there for
maybe the most epic answer we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, it sounds like a good life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just loving life, just making people
happy and just live in your best life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so fitting that that is,
that is your answer.
